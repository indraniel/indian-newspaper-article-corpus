    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Coimbatore on February 2 to inaugurate the Employees State Insurance Corporation Medical College and also address a public meeting.\n\nAccording to S.R. Seghar, state media in-charge, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the medical college around 3 p.m. and thereafter address the meeting at the grounds near the CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex around 6 p.m.\n\nIn all likelihood, the Prime Minister\u2019s public meeting will kick start the BJP\u2019s election campaign in western districts, where it thinks it has a good presence. The party leaders are working hard to mobilise as many public workers as possible from The Nilgiris to Salem districts. \u201cOur target is to make one lakh persons attend the rally,\u201d Mr. Seghar said.\n\nEven as the party is mobilising workers, it is also talking to its alliance partners so that they can share stage with Mr. Modi.\n\nBJP sources say the Prime Minister\u2019s presence will boost the confidence of workers and leaders alike ahead of the Assembly elections.\n\nThe party is focussing on those Assembly segments where it performed well in the 2014 Parliamentary election.",
