Rajarathinam\n\n\u201cWe must not forget those who have contributed to our development and societal progress. The allocation of money from the Tiruvarur MLA Constituency Development Fund for constructing the classrooms is a fitting gesture of giving it back to my school,\u201d DMK president M. Karunanidhi said here on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at a function after declaring open the new classrooms constructed at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh at his alma mater, VS Boys Higher Secondary School here, Mr. Karunanidhi observed that his modest socio economical background made him reflect on the position and progress of the downtrodden throughout his career.\n\n\u201cMore than being the DMK president or Chief Minister, what matters to me the most is the unstinted and unpolluted affection of hundreds of my well wishers and admirers,\u201d Mr. Karunanidhi said.\n\nOverwhelmed by the occasion, the DMK president reminisced how he felt returning to the school that educated him, the classes where he strode, the teachers who shaped him, the friends who shared their thoughts with him and the town that adored him, egging him to grow. \u201cHow I wish my mother had been here to savour the moment,\u201d he wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cI take all the encomiums showered on me as manure to further work for the downtrodden and the oppressed sections of society,\u201d Mr. Karunanidhi observed.",
