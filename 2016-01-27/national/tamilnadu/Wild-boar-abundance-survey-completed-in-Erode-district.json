    "text": "The Forest Department has completed the wild boar abundance survey in the district, as part of a Statewide exercise, which is considered a preparatory step by the State Government for categorising it as a vermin that could be killed by farmers facing huge losses due to destruction caused by the animals to the crops.\n\nThe animals are stated to have multiplied phenomenally in the forest areas and have been causing severe destruction to maize, tapioca and other crops in hundreds of fringe villages in Anthiyur, Athani and Gobi areas in the district.\n\nFarmers are helpless as the animals that come in herds during night hours are aggressive.\n\nAccording to Suba Thalapathy, president of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers\u2019 Association, the State Government ought to have focussed its attention on the plight of several thousands of farmers facing severe crisis caused by the wild boars rather than espousing the cause of jallikattu.\n\nA public hearing that a senior official conducted at Sathyamangalam on the issue a few years back has not been made public as yet, he said.\n\nThe problem with the wild boars is that they procreate at a rapid pace, similar to pigs, and now the population has become unmanageable.\n\nTelengana, Uttarkhand, and Kerala governments have already put the animal on vermin list considering its threat to human life and property, paving way for farmers to kill them with sufficient safeguards.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the Chief Wild Life Warden has to take a call, sources said.",
