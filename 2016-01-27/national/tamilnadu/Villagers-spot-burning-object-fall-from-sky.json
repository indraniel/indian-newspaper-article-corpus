It weighed about 200 gm. Villagers were scared to come near the pit. The pit was filled with water as it was an agricultural field. We handed over the stone to the tahsildar,\u201d said Syed Noorullah, station officer, Vaniyambadi Fire and Rescue Services. Villagers had informed the revenue officials of the incident at 1.45 p.m. T.
