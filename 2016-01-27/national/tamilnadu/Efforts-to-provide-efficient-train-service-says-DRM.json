    "text": "Security of passengers and railway assets in Tiruchi Railway Division has been kept at the best level with efforts of the Railway Protection Force and the Government Railway Police, Divisional Railway Manager A.K. Agarwal said on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at the Republic Day celebrations here after unfurling the national flag and inspecting the ceremonial parade by the RPF personnel, he said it was the endeavour of the Tiruchi Division to provide safe and efficient train services and passenger amenities at stations and in trains.\n\nAlthough the overall income of the division was 11 per cent less than last year, it was able to control expenditure to the extent of maintaining the performance and efficiency index almost at the same level. The new initiative to use five per cent bio-diesel to power diesel locomotives would go a long way in protecting environment.\n\nTouching on the passenger amenities front, he said 40 ATVMs had been provided in the division to facilitate unreserved ticket booking. Coach indication boards had been provided at 14 stations till now. Stating that safety was of utmost importance, he said nine more level crossings had been manned and two more crossings had been interlocked. He inspected the slew of weapons used by RPF personnel that were kept on display at the Kallukuzhi stadium where the celebration was held. The event was marked by dog show of the RPF Dog Squad and cultural programmes.",
