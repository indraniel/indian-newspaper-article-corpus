    "text": "P. Chandran (62), once a textile entrepreneur and now a textile worker after his business collapsed, is slowly becoming a popular figure in the knit city owing to his resemblance to Gandhiji.\n\nHe is now a regular coming to Independence/Republic day celebrations and crusades against liquor and corruption, all dressed up like Gandhiji. Behind the joy of enjoying the status, the tale of Chandran has been one of fluctuating fortunes.\n\n\u201cAfter suffering losses while running a textile ancillary unit a decade ago, I started working in one of the textile units in the cluster.\n\nI became an alcoholic. And it was during one of the hospitalisation periods, a friend of mine who came to see me spotted my resemblance to Gandhiji and asked me to propagate Gandhiji\u2019s principles among people after dressing up like him,\u201d Mr. Chandran said.\n\nThis incident changed Chandran\u2019s life. He started dressing up like Gandhiji and voluntarily began crusading against liquor and corruption in the spare times he gets from the work, all after turning immediately a teetotaller. He tells that he is now extremely content with life by doing campaigns for a social cause.",
