The Government must immediately transfer us to other affiliated colleges so that we can continue our education meaningfully,\u201d says Komala, a naturopathy and yoga science student who enrolled in 2010 through the single window counselling conducted by the Directorate of Medical Education.\n\n\u201cAll our school certificates are with the college. The authorities must restore them to us and also compensate us for the money we had spent all these years,\u201d adds the girl, who was among six students who consumed rat poison last October in a vain bid to convince the Villupuram Collector to take action against the errant institution.\n\nKomala laments that the students got to see their teachers only a week before every examination season.\n\n\u201cThe institution never had full-time teachers. Just before the examination, the principal (since arrested) and a couple of teachers would rush through the portions. During the rest of the year, we would be forced to do all kinds of chores including cooking food for the college chairperson and her family and cleaning up the premises. We even fixed broken pipelines in the bathroom,\u201d she alleges. Students who complained were harassed or have had their examination hall tickets withheld.\n\nMany students had dropped out of the college unable to withstand the monetary exploitation and academic deprivation. Students said that since 2011 they have been attending the weekly grievance day meeting at the Collector\u2019s office to submit petitions against the college, an exercise which has proved to be an empty ritual. .\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of shame that a college such as this was functioning in Tamil Nadu, exploiting students from poor families,\u201d says Prof. E. Balagurusamy, former member of the State Planning Commission and ex-Vice Chancellor of Anna University. \u201cIn the interest of the students, the Government and the university must immediately transfer all existing students to other colleges and ensure that they complete their studies and get a degree without paying additional fee,\u201d he adds.\n\nMr. Balagurusamy wonders how the college was still listed as an affiliated institution on the websites of the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University and the Tamil Nadu Health Department when the Vice Chancellor has claimed that the college was not granted affiliation for the current year. Demanding a probe by a sitting High Court judge or the CBI into how the college was allowed to function all these years, he sought action against local authorities who failed to respond to repeated complaints of the students.\n\n\u2018It is a matter of shame that a college such as this was functioning in\n\nTamil Nadu\u2019",
