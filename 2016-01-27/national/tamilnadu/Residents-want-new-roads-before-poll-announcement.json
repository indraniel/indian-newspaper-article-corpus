Gajalakshmi participated in the meeting at Villivalam in Walajahbad Panchayat Union. Similar meetings were convened in 633 village panchayats in the district, officials said.\n\nAt Perumbakkam village panchayat, D. Farida Bhanu, Tambaram Revenue Divisional Officer, said they received petitions on problems in flood relief and they were being attended to by the respective departments.\n\nOn complaints about poor amenities, Suhasini Rangarajan, Perumbakkam village panchayat president, said they were taking all steps to meet the ever growing requirements of residents in the newly developing areas in their panchayat. V. Rajasekaran, president of Rayappa Nagar Tiruvalluvar Residents\u2019 Welfare Association in Varadarajapuram, near Tambaram, said the Adyar river continued to be encroached on and they should be removed.\n\n\u2018Grama sabha\u2019 meetings were organised in southern suburbs on Republic Day",
