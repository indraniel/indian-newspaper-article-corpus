    "text": "Madurai district should be declared a \u201cdisturbed area\u201d for the \u201cincreasing\u201d atrocities against Dalits, Puthiya Tamilagam founder K. Krishnasamy said. He also demanded that a special court should be set up to hear such cases.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Tuesday, he said the recent attack on Dalits by caste Hindus in Kuruvithurai near Sholavandan was a result of the lackadaisical attitude of the district administration and police against the prevalence of practice of untouchability.\n\nDouble-tumbler system was still in vogue in Kuruvithurai, he said, adding other parts of the districts, including Tirumangalam and Tirupparankundram areas, practised other forms of untouchability. The authorities were not keen on abolishing the evil, but were trying to find short-cuts like creating separate facilities for Dalits.\n\nHe wanted the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission of Scheduled Castes to take action against perpetrators of atrocities against Dalits.\n\nOn the death of three students of SVS College in Villuppuram district, he sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe. Stating that the district administration and the State government had ignored repeated complaints of the students for the last six months, he charged that the death could not be taken lightly.\n\nBesides, the State government should form committees to take a survey of \u201cfake\u201d institutions offering medical-related courses such as nursing and lab technicians without basic facilities. \u201cThe survey should be done under the direct supervision of the High Court to prevent recurrence of such deaths,\u201d he said.",
