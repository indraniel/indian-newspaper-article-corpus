Sudhakar Reddy asserted that the party was one of the four founders of the PWF and would continue to fight the corrupt. The Dravidian parties have given up Periyar\u2019s ideology and were in the centre of grave corruption charges. Vidhuthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader, Thol. Tirumavalavan, said the PWF was not just an alternative front to the Dravidian parties, but one with an alternative political ideology of multi-party rule.\n\n\u201cThe Dravidian parties have been making piggyback rides on smaller parties by forming poll alliance to fight election, but do not give a share in governance. The PWF aims to give the common man a share in governance in Tamil Nadu for the first time,\u201d he said, amid loud cheer and applause.\n\nThe \u201cPWF is not a substitute, but an alternative,\u201d he said. CPI(M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan, CPI veteran R. Nallakannu, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan and MDMK general secretary Vaiko spoke.\n\n\u2018The Dravidian parties have\n\nbeen riding piggyback on smaller parties\u2019",
