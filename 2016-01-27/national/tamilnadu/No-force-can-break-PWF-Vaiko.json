And the DMK was silent on the issue. So, is the case of DMK on granite scam report by the Sagayam panel,\u201d he added. Stating that there was a phenomenal increase in the number of sexual assault on minor children in the State in the last four-and-a-half-year rule, he said it was mainly because of TASMAC. Stating that the DMK, which did not condemn the death of Gandhian Sasi Perumal who fought for prohibition, Mr. Vaiko said that the party was now promising to bring in prohibition if it came to power.\n\n\u201cWill this party do it? Then, why did it not implement it after it made the same promise in 1996,\u201d he asked.\n\nThe PWF on coming to power will set up Lok Ayuktha and form a transparent government, Mr. Vaiko said. Efforts to break the PWF by political opponents will meet with failure only, he asserted.",
