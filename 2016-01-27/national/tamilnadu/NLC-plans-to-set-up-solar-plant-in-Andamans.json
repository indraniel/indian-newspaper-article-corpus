We have provided a proposal which is under scrutiny,\u201d P. Selvakumar, Director (Projects & Planning), NLC, told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cThere is a hydel power station in Andamans, which is working only at 20 per cent capacity. We have proposed to put up a 20-MW plant at the facility to pump backwaters to the upper reservoir so that the hydel plant can utilise this recycled water,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company has also invited global bids to set up two 65-MW solar power plants in Neyveli township and two more 65-MW solar plants in Rajasthan.\n\n10-MW solar plant\n\nNLC had set up a 10-MW solar plant in Neyveli last September.\n\n\u201cThese solar plants will come up at our existing facilities and be connected to the grid. We have floated a global tender as we want to compete with the market which is price competitive.
