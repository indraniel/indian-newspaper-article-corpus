R. Natarajan, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Freedom Fighters and Legal Heirs Samithi. But not all went smoothly on the day even though the officials were seen showing courtesy while honouring them unlike on the previous occasions.\n\nS. Somasundaram, a 95-year-old freedom fighter who took part in the Quit India Movement, had to come on his own from Kanakkampalayam, where he stays with his daughter, to the Chikkanna Government Arts College grounds where the R-day celebrations been held, and had to go back alone. \u201cWe pointed out to the officials that they should have arranged the vehicle to pick up Mr. Somasundaram, who is the only freedom fighter in the function with others been either heirs or kin,\u201d said Mr. Natarajan.",
