Mohammad Yunus, who was honoured by the State government on Tuesday for his selfless, noble act, is looking for funding for his new venture of developing apps.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Venture Capital funding and some have already approached. You will see something big.\u201d Entrepreneurship is not new to him. Yunus runs a real estate firm that helps middle class families search properties based on algorithm.\n\nAccording to the citation, Mr. Yunus was instrumental in the rescue of nearly 1,500 people during the November 17 floods and accommodated them in nearly 300 houses. On December 2, he rescued nearly 600 people when the city went underwater.\n\nHe also rescued a pregnant woman, Chitra, along with her husband Mohan in Urapakkam and admitted her at a hospital in Perungalathur. Chitra gave birth to a girl baby a day later and the couple named their daughter Yunus.\n\nPeople who came to watch the Republic Day parade queued up to take a photograph with the young man.",
