    "text": "For the first time in the history of the Madras High Court, the Republic Day celebrations commenced on Tuesday with a brief parade of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which has started guarding the court premises from November 16, 2015 following an order of the First Bench of the court.\n\nAccepting the honour, the Chief Justice of Madras High Court Sanjay Kishan Kaul hoisted the national flag at around 9.30 am. Addressing the gathering the Chief Justice said, \u201cWe should feel proud about the fact that we are a democracy and republic. Our leaders at the stage of independence in 1947 were able to constitute and establish democracy as an institution, which itself is a matter of pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, we tend to take things for granted, but democracy cannot be taken for granted, because it is a continuing exercise in which there are multifarious aspects, such as empowerment of people, and economic development,\u201d he noted.\n\nNoting that judiciary has also seen changes as democracy, which is inevitable, Mr. Kaul said, \u201cThough we adopted the judicial system from the British, we modulated it to suit the requirements of our country; it is not as if the changes are over, the changes will continue over a period of time and our endeavour to deliver justice will always be there.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Justice then distributed \u201cproximity cards\u201d to High Court staff, which would be soon made mandatory to access the court premises.\n\nThe Special Task Force Commandos of CISF demonstrated skills of the force.",
