While some companies sponsor the language courses, some employees enrol voluntarily.\n\nOne of the large companies here trained a group of its staff in Chinese as it has a manufacturing facility in China.\n\nHowever, when it sends employees to other countries on short-trips, they take the services of translators.\n\nThe demand for learning Japanese has gone up in Coimbatore in the last few years, not only from college students but also small industries that do business with Japan, said S. Shanmuga Priya, director of ABK-ATOS DOSOKAI here.\n\nAccording to Goethe-Zentrum, of the total number of candidates enrolling for German courses, 10 per cent to 15 per cent are employees. But, the number is going up every year.\n\nSome industries, especially the medium-scale ones, might not want to spend on translators in other countries. Hence, they identify the team that will be travelling abroad frequently and enroll them in the foreign language courses here.\n\nThere are graduates and employees who plan to join a company abroad and they take foreign language courses here to equip themselves.\n\nThe cost of learning a foreign language here is also less than learning it in the respective countries, say industry sources.\n\nM.
