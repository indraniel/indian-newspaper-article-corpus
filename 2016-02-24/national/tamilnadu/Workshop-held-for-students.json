Dhapodkar, Senior Professor, School of Fashion, Styling and Textiles, Pearl academy, New Delhi.\n\nHe distinguished the role of fashion designers and technical designers. Once a fashion designer sketches a garment or accessories, the technical designer will figure out how a sketch can be brought to life.\n\nProf. Dhapodkar added that the technical designers who have skill in pattern making and draping are essentially the engineers of fashion.\n\nC. Swaminathan, Vice-Chancellor, Periyar University, inaugurated the workshop.",
