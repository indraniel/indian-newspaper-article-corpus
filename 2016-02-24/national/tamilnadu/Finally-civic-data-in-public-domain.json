They will be placed in the public domain, an initiative that promises to bring about greater transparency.\n\nThe Greater Chennai Corporation has finally decided to put in the public domain matters pertaining to the functioning of nine key departments that play a major role in the local administration of the city.\n\nThese departments are: Family Welfare, Health, Revenue, Solid Waste Management, Parks and Playfields, Works and Town Planning, Electrical Department, Buildings and Storm Water Drains\n\nConsidering the fact that inquiries under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by residents do not elicit sufficient information from the departments concerned, this move is surprising and even encouraging, say residents. \u201cThe decision is expected to help residents assess the real cause of the civic problems. The Corporation should also give information about cost overruns,\u201d said V.S. Jayaraman, a resident of T. Nagar.\n\nGreater Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Revenue and Finance) T.G. Vinay has requested the heads of the nine departments to update the citizens\u2019 charter with complete information about the projects they are handling, including payment of bills, for finishing works. Civic development works to the tune of Rs.2,000 crore are implemented every year and activists allege malpractices in some of the works. Many residents plan to use the data to conduct social audit of civic works.",
