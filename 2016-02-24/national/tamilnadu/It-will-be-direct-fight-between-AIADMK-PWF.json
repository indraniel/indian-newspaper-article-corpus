    "text": "In the forthcoming Assembly elections, it would be a direct fight between the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF), said its convenor Vaiko. Completing his second leg of election campaign here on Monday night, he said that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam would be a nonentity in the elections.\n\nStating that opinion polls were absurd, he said that 65 per cent of the people were neutral voters. They did not belong to any party. They would decide the future of Tamil Nadu. Democratic practices were strangulated in the State Assembly, he added.\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan wondered why DMK president M. Karunanidhi refused to comment on the granite scam in Madurai as he too had ruled the State. Both the AIADMK and the DMK had degraded the political culture, he added. CPI leader S. Periyasamy said that the PWF would continue till the State attained economic and social freedom. Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said that the ensuing Assembly election was an acid test for the PWF as it was opposed to two political giants.",
