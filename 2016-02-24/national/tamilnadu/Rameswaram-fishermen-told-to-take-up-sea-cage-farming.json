Gopalakrishnan, Director of Central Marine Fisheries Research Centre (CMFRI), Kochi said.\n\nAddressing the gathering before distributing hatchery-produced Cobia fingerlings to select fishers at Mandapam Regional Centre of CMFRI here on Tuesday, he said sea cage farming of the two high value species could be an ideal alternative to the risky trawling and exhorted the marine fishermen to switch over to cage farming.\n\nHe said the Mandapam Regional Centre, which has perfected breeding, seed production and farming technologies for the two species, produced about two lakh fingerlings of Pompano and 50,000 fingerlings of Cobia in a year for the benefit of local fishermen and entrepreneurs.\n\nDespite being a research Institute, CMFRI continued in the seed production for the benefit of fishermen, he said adding at present 16 fishermen Self Help Groups were engaged in sea cage farming, setting up 50 cages in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay.\n\n\u201cIt is quite profitable and this can be the best alternative for marine fishers,\u201d he said.\n\nSeaweed rafts\n\nThe fishermen could take up sea cage farming, he said adding they could benefit more if they took up Integrated Multi Tropic Aquaculture (IMTA) and cultivated \u2018kappaphycus,\u2019 using seaweed rafts attached to the cages.\n\nThey could harvest about 300 kg of \u2018kappaphycus\u2019 per raft in 45 days, even while growing the marine fishes.\n\nHatchery proposed\n\nAs the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department proposed to set up a hatchery for producing seeds of the two species, jointly with CMFRI, the demand for seeds could be easily met in the coming years, he said.\n\nA. K. Abdul Nazar, Scientist in-charge, CMFRI, Mandapam region said the introduction of sea cage farming has helped fishermen improve their economic standards.\n\nK.
