Following the heavy rain, the issue of poor maintenance of Chembarambakkam Reservoir, one of the main sources for drinking water for city residents, has been raised by those living around it.\n\nThe residents said that only temporary steps were taken to protect it, but the two government agencies involved \u2014 Water Resources Department and Chennai Metrowater \u2014 were yet to initiate permanent measures. S. Raja of Periyar Nagar, Nandambakkam, said the sidewalls of the shutters in the reservoir started developing cracks and wall packing (that holds the cement structure with bund) gave way after the rains.\n\n\u201cThough workers packed the broken wall with sand bags, further course of repair is yet to begin,\u201d he added.\n\nM. Suresh of Surya Nagar said the walls developed cracks at many levels and it created a sense of fear among residents, who were closely monitoring the water levels after every spell of rain during the monsoon last year. He said the walls were built by WRD several years ago were strong enough all these years.\n\nBut, the recent heavy downpour left them with a permanent \u2018scar\u2019. \u201cThe walls should be repaired as an emergency measure before the announcement of Assembly elections,\u201d he said.",
