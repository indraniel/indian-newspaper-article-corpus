Ravichandran (CPI) gave representations to Mayor and Commissioner highlighting the urgent need to end the indefinite fast being observed by a section of Corporation workers.\n\n\u201cThe agitation has affected drinking water distribution\u201d, the councillors said . As many as 32 out of the around 200 overhead water tank operators, conservancy workers, and drivers, who were merged into the Corporation staff core from eight village panchayats and two municipalities, went on a fast asking for parity in wages with the workers on the same rank who had been with the Corporation before the merger of the said local bodies.\n\nThe fast on Tuesday entered fifth day. Senior revenue officials held talks with the fasting workers. But the workers were stern on the demand that they had to be given wages on a par with the other workers as they were absorbed as Corporation employees more than three years ago.\n\nHowever, the workers said that at least the district administration should make arrangements to give a \u2018healthy consolidated pay\u2019 till the orders for issuing wages on par with other workers come. \u201cAt the moment, the 200 workers are getting Rs. 66.6 a day\u201d, said K. Rangaraj, Assistant District Secretary of CITU, who lead the agitation.",
