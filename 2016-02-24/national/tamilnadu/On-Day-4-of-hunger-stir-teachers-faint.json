Ganesan\n\nTense moments prevailed on the Directorate of Public Information (DPI) campus on Tuesday after four teachers participating in a hunger strike fainted in the afternoon.\n\nThe teachers belonging to the Secondary Grade Seniority Teacher\u2019s Association have been protesting for four days on the campus, demanding equal pay scale within the state. Around 200 teachers have been on a hunger strike.\n\n\u201cThe teachers who joined after June 2009 are given a basic pay of Rs. 5,200; and teachers who were appointed even a month before that, are paid Rs. 8,370 as basic salary. We have been asking for such disparity to be removed but no action has been taken to address this matter,\u201d said K. Kumaresan, district general secretary of the Association from Madurai.\n\nTeachers from districts across the state have been participating in the strike and said they would continue with the hunger strike till their grievance is met.\n\nOn Tuesday, a few of them had also brought their children to the strike venue.\n\nThe four teachers who fainted were given first-aid by medical personnel who were there with 108 ambulances and rushed to the Kilpauk Medical College.\n\nLater, in the evening, the protesting teachers re-joined the strike.",
