    "text": "Residents of Thoothukudi are still worried about the poor condition of roads in the town.\n\nPeople heaved a sigh of relief after the Corporation re-laid the Victoria Extension Road after a long time . But the relaying of George Road, which is in a very bad condition, is getting delayed. George Road is not alone.\n\nThere are other roads like Chidambara Nagar Main Road, Bryant Nagar Main Road and New Colony Road in the same condition. Since these are busy thoroughfares, priority should be accorded for their repair, R. Baskar, a resident, said here on Tuesday.\n\nApart from bearing the brunt of a roller-coaster ride on these roads, people were also exposed to health hazards as they had to inhale dust and smoke that cause respiratory problems, he said. Executive Engineer of Thoothukudi Corporation A. Lakshmanan told The Hindu that road development work had been taken up at many places. Utilising the Disaster Management Fund, repair and renovation work had been taken up in 39 roads at a cost of Rs.8.4 crore. The work would be completed by the end of this month. Improvement work on George Road, which comes under the Department of Highways, would be completed in a couple of weeks, according to officials.\n\nThough the George Road would not have blacktopping, patch work on rain damaged stretches would be done. Paver blocks would be laid on the worst hit stretch of 150 metres on the road, sources added.",
