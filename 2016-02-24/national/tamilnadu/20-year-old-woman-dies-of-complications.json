    "text": "A 20-year-old woman died of postpartum complications here at Keezhakochhavur village in Anjetti on Tuesday. The death occurred after the woman Maadevi delivered a baby girl on Monday night.\n\nWhen contacted, an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) said that they were not aware of the presence of a pregnant woman in the village, as most of the people are away on wage labour and houses are often locked. However, according to the ASHA worker, an inquiry with the family revealed that Maadevi was taken to Denkanikottai Government Hospital earlier where her due date was stated. But she was taken back home. The village falls under Anjetti Primary Health Centre and the family never admitted Maadevi for delivery. The village has no village health nurse, as is the case with a majority of villages in Kelamangalam and Thally blocks.\n\nHer delivery on Monday night was suspected to have been 13 days post the due date, the health worker told The Hindu. Maadevi had earlier suffered a miscarriage in her 8th month of pregnancy during her first pregnancy.",
