    "text": "Members of Tirunelveli District Pentecostal Churches Federation organised a gathering at Jawahar Grounds in Palayamkottai on Tuesday to condemn the \u201csteadily increasing attacks on Christians\u201d involved in evangelism, and urge the State and the Central governments to act tough against the attackers.\n\nThe protestors said that Christians, who had never involved themselves in any antisocial and anti-national activities in any part of the country, were being targeted by Hindutva fundamentalists in a bid to discourage them from preaching Christianity though it had been allowed in the country as per the Constitution. The recent attacks on Christians, especially on evangelists, prayer halls, churches and houses where Christians used to gather for prayers, as per a 2000-year-old tradition, had shattered the firm belief that they were living in a democratic and secular nation.\n\n\u201cThough we\u2019re being targeted, we\u2019ve never retaliated and done anything that would undermine the tranquillity of society as Christianity is all about love, compassion and brotherhood. Without breaching the limits and encroaching upon others\u2019 religious rights, we\u2019re following and practising our religion. However, heads of a few Hindutva outfits are encouraging their cadres to orchestrate attacks against us,\u201d said R. Babu Paul Dinakaran, district secretary of the Federation.\n\nThe protestors said that the attacks being unleashed against those who were distributing religious pamphlets, involved in evangelism and on prayer halls should be stopped through lawful action by the police. The hoardings carrying messages dividing people in the name of religion should be removed.\n\nA special team should be appointed to monitor the distribution of loans and assistances to the minority Christians, they said.",
