Siva Saravanan.\n\nResidents of Savukkadu, Muttathuvayal and a few other villages in Thondamuthur Panchayat Union on Tuesday demanded free allotment of lands to build houses. The residents, most of them farm labourers, said that 150 families were living in the areas without a house or land to their name.\n\nPetition\n\nThey had petitioned the local and district Revenue authorities for free allotment of land in 1987, 1988, 2000, and twice in 2015 in May and October.\n\nAfter the last petition in October , the authorities informed them that there was no Revenue land available for free distribution in the area. But that was not true as four acres in survey number 1077/2, 3 and four were available for distribution.\n\nThere was also the Revenue land near the Mullangadu Forest Department check post and in Savukkadu. There were also lands that were under encroachment. Therefore, the district administration should take steps for free allotment of those lands to the poor tribal residents, the petitioners said and warned that if there was no solution in the next 15 days, they would forcefully build huts on the Revenue lands.",
