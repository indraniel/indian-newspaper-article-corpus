Mr. Murukadas was the Governor-Chancellor\u2019s nominee. The Syndicate nominee was Harish Mehta.\n\nPointing out that the Chancellor was the custodian of the University, the associations said that \u201cfor the first time in the history of Tamil Nadu an elected search committee member has resigned expressing dissatisfaction and alleging irregularities in the functioning of the Convener of the Search Committee.
