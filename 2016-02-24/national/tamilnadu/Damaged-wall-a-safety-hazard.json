Ragu\n\nSocial activists in Chetpet are concerned about the danger posed by a damaged concrete wall adjoining the railway tracks near the Chetpet Railway Station.\n\nThis concrete wall had been constructed to prevent people from crossing the railway tracks.\n\nHowever, to avoid taking a detour via the Gurusamy bridge to reach the Chetpet railway station and also to reach the residential localities on either side of the tracks, residents climb over a damaged section of the concrete wall and take a \u2018shortcut\u2019 by crossing the railway tracks.\n\nKarthick, a social activist from Mangalapuram, said two schools were located on either side of the railway track near the Chetpet station and to avoid taking a long walk on the bridge, students of these schools and their parents jump over the concrete wall and cross the track.\n\nCiting a number of accidents in which commuters were run over by speeding trains, he said poor lighting and a blind curve near the damaged wall on McNichols Lane had increased the risk for residents.\n\nRamesh, a resident of the locality, alleged that some autorickshaw drivers had damaged the concrete wall. He said an autorickshaw stand was functioning from McNichols Lane, but the drivers felt that the wall was the reason for them losing business and hence, damaged it. Residents also blamed poor street lighting on the lane leading to the Gurusamy Bridge for anti-social activities that were said to take place at night.\n\nThe local police officials were conducting routine patrol operations but were unable to control such activities, they said.",
