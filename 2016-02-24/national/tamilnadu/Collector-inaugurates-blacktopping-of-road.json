Karunakaran inaugurated renovation of the road connecting Tirunelveli Town Arch and Kurukkuthurai Road on Monday.\n\nThough the new road was formed with the objective of easing traffic congestion around Swamy Nellaiyappar Temple a few months ago by acquiring land from the owner, a case filed with the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption stalled the progress and no blacktopping was provided after blue metal was spread on the stretch.\n\nTrouble to road users\n\nSince the dusty and uneven surface gave a lot of problems to road users, it was decided to provide blacktopping on the road.\n\nSubsequently, Dr. Karunakaran inaugurated the exercise on Monday in the presence of MPs S. Muthukaruppan and Vijila Sathyananth, Tirunelveli MLA Nainar Nagenthran, Tirunelveli Revenue Divisional Officer P. Fermi Vidhya, Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian, Deputy Mayor P.
