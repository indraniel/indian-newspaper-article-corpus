Manikumar and C.T. Selvam warned the Collector of including the State government too as a party to a writ petition filed by the building owner and issuing appropriate directions if he did not take steps to relocate the courts at the earliest. The judges also expressed anguish over officials\u2019 failure to attend to infrastructural requirements of the judiciary.\n\nAdjourned\n\nLater, the hearing on the writ petition was adjourned till Monday to enable a government counsel to obtain instructions from the Collector.\n\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner had stated that he could not take possession of his building, rented out for establishment of the courts, due to the inordinate delay by the district administration in finding an alternative location.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel, A. Velan, pointed out that the petitioner had entered into a rental agreement with the Tenkasi Principal Sub-Court long back and renewed it once in every 11 months.\n\nHowever, since the property had to be partitioned between his legal heirs, the petitioner chose not to renew the agreement after its expiry on November 22, 2013 and sought possession of the building.\n\nRequest not honoured\n\nThe request was not honoured for want of an alternative building to shift the courts.\n\nReplying to one of his representations, the Principal District Judge had on September 18, 2014 said that a letter had been addressed to the District Collector to allot old Taluk Office buildings in Tenkasi for accommodating the two courts until the construction of new combined court buildings in the town.",
