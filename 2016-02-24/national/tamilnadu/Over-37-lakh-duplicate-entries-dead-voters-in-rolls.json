We will remove them once we complete the exercise, which is expected in the next four days,\u201d Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said.\n\nHe also requested the relatives of those persons who are dead to remove their entries through due process. According to the latest figure from the Commission, there are about 5.79 crore voters in the State.\n\nThe Election Commission is also organising a special camp in Chennai, Cuddalore, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts on February 29, in which voters, who had lost their Electors Photo Identity Cards (EPICs), can get a new card.\n\nA statement from Mr. Lakhoni said voters can walk into the office of the Electoral Registration Officer and fill form No.001 in these four districts and get new cards.\n\nMembers of the South Indian Artistes Association met Mr. Lakhoni and presented a plea to relax norms, which restricted them from staging plays in the days before and on polling day.",
