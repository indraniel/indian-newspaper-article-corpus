    "text": "In an indication that he may keep away from the DMK-Congress alliance, Tamil Manila Congress (TMC) president G.K. Vasan, on Tuesday, said he would ensure that the \u201cunique identity\u201d of the party is protected in the front it would eventually join.\n\nAddressing a press conference here, Mr. Vasan said interviews of ticket aspirants concluded on Tuesday. A total of 4,887 persons had applied.\n\nAsked if he would be part of the DMK alliance since the Congress had already joined it, Mr. Vasan said TMC would be part of a winning alliance. \u201cThe party will be part of an alliance in which its unique identity would be protected,\u201d he stressed.\n\nMr. Vasan said at least 80 per cent of Congress cadres had come with the TMC when it split in November 2014. \u201cOur strength had grown in these 15 months. This will be reflected in the election,\u201d he said as a reply to Congress leaders who had claimed that the DMK\u2019s neglect of the TMC was an indication of its weakness.\n\nHe said there was no hurry to decide on alliance. \u201cI have said that I will announce by March second week. But this does not mean I will not reveal before this date,\u201d he claimed.",
