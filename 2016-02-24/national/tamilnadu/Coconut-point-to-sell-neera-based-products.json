Half of the initial expenditure to set up the facility is met from the corpus created by the farmers\u2019 consortium. The remaining amount is given as financial assistance from Coconut Development Board,\u201d said S. Selvaraj, president of the farmers collective, Udumalpet Coconut Farmers\u2019 Producer Company.\n\nThe \u2018coconut point\u2019 will sell black sugar, honey, biscuits, jaggery, all made from coconut neera, soap and oil under the common brand of \u2018Snehalaya.\u2019 \u201cOur aim is to penetrate local markets for the products through this sales point,\u201d said Mr. Selvaraj. Regarding exports, Mr. Selvaraj said that the company was able to cater to orders for raw coconuts from Middle East nations.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have exported 56 tonnes of raw coconuts. We are expecting to get more orders,\u201d he added.",
