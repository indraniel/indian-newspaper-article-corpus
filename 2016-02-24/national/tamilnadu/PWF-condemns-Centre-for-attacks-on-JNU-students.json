Raja\u2019s purported comments targeting CPI MP D. Raja over the JNU row. While demanding a ban on the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the demonstrators sought the release of the arrested student leader Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the protest venue, Mr. Varadarajan accused the BJP government of letting loose attacks on those who had different ideology and those speaking against the government.\n\nThe PWF had been created with the objective of saving democracy in the country and to quell fundamentalist forces, he said. The PWF had been fighting for an alternative in Tamil Nadu, he said.",
