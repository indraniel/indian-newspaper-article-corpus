Siva Saravanan.\n\nResidents of Sivalingapuram, Chinnasamy Layout, Senthil Nagar and a few other areas protested in front of the Coimbatore Corporation East Zone office in Singanallur on Tuesday demanding basic amenities.\n\nSivalingapuram Residents\u2019 Welfare Association deputy secretary V. Deivendran said that the 100-plus residents who lived in Ward 59 were forced into protesting as the Corporation had not met several of their demands.\n\nThe residents have been asking for good sewerage facility for the past 30 years but the Corporation had only delivered promises that it had not kept. It was the same with roads and street lights.\n\nThe residents had petitioned the authorities in the East Zone, senior officials in the main office in Town Hall and also the Chief Minister\u2019s cell but very little had come of those efforts.\n\nSoon after the residents\u2019 protest, senior officials promised to look into their demands and at least build new roads before the imposition of the Model Code of Conduct ahead of the Assembly election and fulfil the other demands later. Based on the assurance, the residents gave up their hour-long protest.",
