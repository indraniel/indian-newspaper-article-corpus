    "text": "The full page advertisement issued by DMK in many newspapers on Tuesday, which criticised Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for allegedly being out of public presence, appeared to have outraged the AIADMK men as many AIADMK Councillors took a dig at the advertisement at the council meeting on Tuesday.\n\nThey questioned the right of DMK president M. Karunanidhi, who, according to them, seldom attended Assembly sessions, to level criticism against Ms. Jayalalithaa.\n\nAs it has become the norm in the present Corporation Council, four resolution heaping praises on the Chief Minister and another resolution strongly criticising DMK were passed at the meeting.\n\nEarlier, before the meeting commenced, a cake weighing 68 kilograms was cut by Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa to mark the 68th birthday of Ms. Jayalalithaa on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, DMK councillors boycotted the meeting.",
