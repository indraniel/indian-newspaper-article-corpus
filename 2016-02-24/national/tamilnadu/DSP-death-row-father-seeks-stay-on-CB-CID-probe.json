    "text": "Claiming that he has no confidence in the investigation being carried out by the CB-CID into the alleged suicide of DSP Vishnupriya, her father M. Ravi has approached the Madras High Court seeking an interim stay on the investigation.\n\nMr. Ravi also sought the High Court to set aside a single judge order dated December 1, 2015 dismissing his plea to transfer the investigation to CBI.\n\nIn his appeal, Mr. Ravi submitted that his daughter was found dead on September 18, 2015 under mysterious circumstances when she was handling the investigation of a sensational murder case.\n\nAlleging high-level conspiracy in the death, Mr. Ravi said, \u201cWhen the involvement of two senior police officers \u2013 Namakkal SP S.R. Senthil Kumar and Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Salem Range, Vidhya Kulkarni \u2013 is being suspected in my daughter\u2019s death, they are still at the helm of affairs in the same jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nPolice Standing Order 490 (4) clearly states that even when a case is investigated by the CB-CID, the officials of the agency have to work under the control of the SP of the district concerned, Mr. Ravi said. \u201cTherefore, the investigation conducted by the CB-CID cannot be fair,\u201d he said.\n\nAlleging that the single judge failed to consider the allegations levelled against the senior officers concerned and failed to pave way for an impartial investigation, the appellant sought to set aside the order. Admitting the appeal, a Division Bench ordered notice to the State government to file a counter affidavit within two weeks.",
