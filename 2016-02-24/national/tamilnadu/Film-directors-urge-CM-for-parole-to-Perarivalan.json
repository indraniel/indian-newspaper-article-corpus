His application seeking parole was sent to the government on February 8.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to meet us. Earlier this month, he had sought parole to meet his father, who has not been keeping well. As there has been no information on his application, he wanted us to bring it to the notice of the Chief Minister,\u201d he told reporters. Directors S.P. Jananathan and Karu Palaniappan accompanied him during the visit.\n\nBasic right\n\nHe added that Perarivalan has not sought parole during his 25 years of being imprisoned. \u201cThis is a basic right of a prisoner.
