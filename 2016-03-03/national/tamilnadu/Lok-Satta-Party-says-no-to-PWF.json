    "text": "The Tamil Nadu unit of Lok Satta Party, instituted by bureaucrat Jayaprakash Narayanan, unveiled its election manifesto, promising free education and universal healthcare.\n\nThe party, which contested in 29 seats in 2011 State elections, barely made a dent as it polled just 0.08 per cent of the total votes in the State.\n\nD. Jagadeeswaran, State president, said that the party would contest the election along with student leaders, community leaders and academics under the alliance called Pudhiya Sakthi Ani. \u201cWe have identified credible people across Tamil Nadu. We will put up candidates who can really change society,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if the party would align with any major parties, he said that the party would not go with the DMK or the AIADMK. \u201cThey both are corrupt and we want to create space for an alternative,\u201d Mr. Jagadeeswaran said.\n\nHe also ruled out joining the People\u2019s Welfare Front on the account that they are against \u2018free market economics.\u2019 \u201cOur party advocates liberal economy and liberal politics. We will never side with the Communists,\u201d he said.",
