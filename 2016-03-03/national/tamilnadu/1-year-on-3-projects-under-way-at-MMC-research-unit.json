Narayanaswamy, State nodal officer for the research units.\n\n\u201cWe were given Rs. 1.25 crore by the government of India. Rs. 25 lakh was used to set up the unit, renovation and other work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe unit aimed at encouraging and strengthening an environment of research in medical colleges and bridging gaps in infrastructure. Special focus is paid to the field of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiac problems.\n\nK. Kalaichelvi, head of the medical oncology department, is researching the prevailing molecular aberrations in gastric cancer, specifically sporadic gastric cancer and attempting to find molecular markers for it. \u201cWe get about 400 cases of stomach cancer every year at the hospital, and most come in the advanced stage. Chennai has 12 cases of stomach cancer per 1 lakh population, which is the highest among metros in India,\u201d she said. Each research team has two scientists, two technicians and one person for data collection. Any faculty member of the college can start a research project, which is first vetted by an ethical committee, a local advisory research committee and then approved of by the government of India, he said.\n\n\u201cTwo or more departments together can also work on a project \u2014 the idea is to promote multidisciplinary work. The faculty can also collaborate with outside research institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nEach research team has two scientists, two technicians and one person for data collection",
