Malaiyandi, district environmental engineer of TNPCB, Vaniyambadi had received a complaint from farmers of Girisamudram on Wednesday morning that CETP was discharging effluents into an irrigation canal. The official immediately rushed to the spot. \u201cThere was no discharge into the canal at the time of inspection, but we found a flexible hose pipe from the CETP in the canal,\u201d Mr. Malaiyandi said.\n\nZero liquid discharge system\n\nThe pipe was from the last component of the CETP \u2013 solar evaporation pan, he said, adding that there are 120 member units linked to the CETP. CETPs have to follow zero liquid discharge system, he noted.\n\n\u201cFollowing this, we have given instructions orally to the 120 member units to temporarily stop wet process activities.\n\nThese are operations in which effluents are generated until further instructions from TNPCB, Chennai. This is because the member units should not send out the water to the CETP,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official has sent a report to the board\u2019s chairperson in Chennai for further decision.",
