    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has come to the rescue of a retired district court employee whose son was denied employment on compassionate grounds since the retiree had completed 15 days more than the cut-off age of 53 years by the time his application was processed and he was allowed to retire on the ground of medical invalidation.\n\nAllowing a writ petition filed by R. Venkadesh, son of B. Ravindranath, Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam held that the retired employee and his son could not be punished for the delay caused by judicial officers and government doctors in Tirunelveli district in considering a plea made for retirement on medical grounds and consequent appointment on compassionate grounds.\n\nThe judges pointed out that Mr. Ravindranath was an Office Assistant in a Judicial Magistrate Court in Tirunelveli. He had made a representation to Chief Judicial Magistrate on December 2, 2013 to permit him to retire from service on medical grounds and consequentially appoint his son in a suitable position.\n\nThe CJM referred the employee to medical examination only on February 20, 2014.\n\nThe Dean of Government Medical College Hospital, in turn, directed the employee to appear before a Medical Board on March 10, 2014 and a report was forwarded on April 2, 2014.\n\nThe CJM accepted the report and allowed the Office Assistant to retire on April 30, 2014.\n\nBy that time, the employee had crossed the age of 53 years and hence his son was denied compassionate employment.",
