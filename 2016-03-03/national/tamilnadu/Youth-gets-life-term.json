    "text": "Fast Track Mahila Court Judge J. Flora on Wednesday sentenced a man accused of murdering a woman to undergo life imprisonment.\n\nThe accused was found guilty on three counts and sentences were ordered to be run concurrently. According to prosecution, I. Manikandan (24) of Karupur was found guilty of murdering S. Balasithammal (37) while she was grazing goats.\n\nSince Balasithammal did not give money demanded by Manikandan who suffered loss in his goat selling business, he beat her to death with a log off Naripatti Road in Karupur. Subsequently, he robbed her jewels and disfigured her face by burning to prevent identification. Ettayapuram police had registered a case.\n\nThe accused was punished under Section 302 (murder) of IPC, for which life sentence and fine of Rs.1,000 was imposed, and under Section 397 (robbery) of IPC, which attracted rigorous imprisonment of 10 years with a fine of Rs.1,000, and Section 201 read with Section 511 of IPC (attempt to cause disappearance of evidence), which attracted four years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000.",
