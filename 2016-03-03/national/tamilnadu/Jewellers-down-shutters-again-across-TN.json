Nearly 35,000 jewellers and 12 lakh workers in the industry across the State have joined the nation-wide strike called by the All India Gem and Jewellery Federation.\n\nThe levy of excise duty is expected to send the already spiralling gold prices higher. Jewellers noted that customers would have to shell out a minimum of two or three per cent towards wastage because of the levy of excise duty. They are already paying value added tax on gold purchases and face tax deduction at source if the purchase is above Rs.2 lakh.\n\nThe ongoing strike is estimated to bring a loss of nearly Rs.1,500 crore in the State. Of this, the business for three days in Chennai and Coimbatore alone would account to Rs. 200 crore and Rs.75 crore respectively. In Chennai alone, nearly 7,000 jewellers and 2.5 lakh workers, including goldsmiths mainly concentrated on NSC Bose Road, joined the strike.\n\nJayanthilal Challani, president of Madras Jewellers and Diamond Merchants Association, said: \u201cCustomers may have to pay at least Rs.250 more for every sovereign they purchase. The increase in overheads for jewellers to maintain additional records for excise duty will be shifted to customers indirectly.\u201d\n\nIn Coimbatore, more than 600 jewellery retail outlets and 2,500 manufacturers participated in the strike and submitted a memorandum to P. Nagarajan, Member of Parliament. \u201cThis time, we had more cooperation for the strike. About 10,000 staff employed in the jewellery shops and 65,000 goldsmith workers here are also taking part,\u201d said B. Muthuvenkatraman, president of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers\u2019 Association.\n\nNearly 400 jewellery shops in Tiruvannamalai district remained closed . \u201cSeveral goldsmiths too are participating in the strike,\u201d said R.Vadivel, president, Tiruvannamalai jewellery association.\n\nAmong the southern districts, Dindigul and Theni merchants alone would suffer a loss of Rs.10 crore in three days. Besides 3,000 small and medium jewellery shops in Nagercoil, about 650 shops in Tirunelveli too participated in the agitation.\n\nMerchants in southern districts noted that the loss would escalate to Rs.150 crore in three days, including Madurai, where 1,500 members affiliated to Madurai bullion merchants association have downed shutters as part of the protest. All India Gem and Jewellery Trade Federation plans to make a strong representation to the government on the issue.\n\n( Reporting by M. Soundariya Preetha, A.D.
