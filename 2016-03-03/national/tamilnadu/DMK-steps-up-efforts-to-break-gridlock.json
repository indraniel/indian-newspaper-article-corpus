    "text": "The DMK and the DMDK continue to hold backroom parleys to break the gridlock in forging an alliance for the 2016 Assembly polls.\n\n\u201cThe talks are continuing through the channel we have established with the DMDK leadership. It could take a week to reach a breakthrough. We hope the outcome will be in our favour. It may also go the other way. Currently, we are holding only informal talks,\u201d said a DMK source involved in the talks with the DMDK leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Sun TV chairman and managing director Kalanithi Maran and Sabareesh, the son-in-law of party treasurer M.K. Stalin, met DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, triggering speculation that they had come to inform the nonagenarian leader about the progress on alliance talks.\n\n\u201cWe do not know whether they (Maran and Sabareesh) met Mr. Vijayakant or not. But the talks are going on,\u201d said a senior DMK leader.\n\nEven though DMDK leader Vijayakant\u2019s declaration that he would rather be \u2018king\u2019 than \u2018kingmaker\u2019 and the meeting between him and senior BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had created the impression that the actor-turned-politician was moving closer to the BJP, DMK sources asserted that the channels with the DMDK were never closed.",
