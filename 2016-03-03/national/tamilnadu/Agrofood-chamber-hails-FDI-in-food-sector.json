The agrofood chamber president, S. Rethinavelu, said in a statement that the announcement addressed the requirements of farmers and food processing industry.\n\nThe chamber, the statement said, was opposed to the entry of FDI in food retail sector as it might lead to entry of foreign food products. However, the present proposal to allow FDI to market the food products produced and manufactured only in India would strengthen the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative. The move would enable small and medium food processing units to employ new technologies for production of quality and innovative value added products. The statement also haled the reduction in basic customs duty on refrigerated containers.",
