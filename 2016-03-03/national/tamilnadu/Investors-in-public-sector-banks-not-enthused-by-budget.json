Balasaravanan, a regular investor in bank equities.\n\nTechnocrats like S. Dhananjayan, a chartered accountant, too reiterated the need for better NPA management if the investors\u2019 money on bank stocks needs to be protected.\n\n\u201cQuantum of capital infusion announced this week is not going to help improve the situation much as the NPA levels in PSU banks are almost high as around Rs. six lakh crore.\n\nIt will take many more months for the equities to recover back to the levels a year ago\u201d, pointed out Mr. Dhananjayan.",
