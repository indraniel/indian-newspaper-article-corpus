    "text": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to reply to a representation made by a volleyball club requesting the Corporation not to use the playground located in Ashok Nagar for any other purpose than sports activity.\n\nThe First Bench headed by Chief Justice S.K. Kaul passed the direction on a plea moved by Vollys Club, an association promoting volleyball seeking to restrain the Corporation from using the ground for any other purpose.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, the Corporation has permitted a private party to organise a food festival on the playground on March 5 and 6. The club alleged that using the ground for any other purpose not related to sports in any manner would be highly detrimental to the interest of the residents of Ashok Nagar.\n\n\u201cIf such events are permitted, it would set a precedent for a stream of events eventually leading to complete deterioration of the quality and the purpose of the playground,\u201d the petitioner said.\n\nWhen the plea came up for hearing, the Bench directed the authorities to reply a representation moved by the petitioner within a week with a direction to ensure that the guidelines to use such play grounds, if any, are followed by the private party.\n\nPlea was filed as permission was given to organise a food fest on ground in Ashok Nagar",
