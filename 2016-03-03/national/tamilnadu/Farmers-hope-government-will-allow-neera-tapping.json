    "text": "Coconut farmers expect the State Government to come out with a favourable policy for tapping \u2018neera.\u2019\n\nFarmers in the district have been lobbying hard for permission to tap neera to make coconut cultivation more profitable.\n\nUltimately, the State Government has been convinced about the Coconut Development Board\u2019s differentiation between neera and toddy, according to Logusamy, a functionary of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam.\n\nIn neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka, neera or padani extracted from coconut palm is being considered a non-alcoholic beverage.\n\nTapping of neera will open up opportunities for production of coconut sugar.\n\nAccording to C. Nallasamy, president, Lower Bhavani Project Farmers\u2019 Welfare Association, there were state-of-art technologies to tap and preserve neera for long durations.\n\nNeera tapped from coconut trees in the district will command more value since several farmers have raised the crop in natural conditions without use of chemical fertilizers.\n\nAccording to farmers, the State Government has received feedback that its goodwill among the agricultural community will go up if a favourable order was issued to tap neera.",
