    "text": "Special children should be treated well and access to education and health care should be ensured to them on a par with other children. Any deficiency in providing such care would amount to violation of law and it was also against the Constitution, said District Judge R. Poornima.\n\nAddressing a legal awareness programme meant for special children at a children\u2019s home here on Wednesday, she said that parents should ensure that special children were accommodated only in government registered schools and homes and treated by registered medical practitioners and in recognised hospitals. Doctors should visit these homes periodically, she stressed.\n\nNo partiality should be shown to these children. If there were any deficiency, the parents could approach the legal service centre for help and legal assistance.\n\nCare and compassion were necessary to these children. Parents should have patience while handling them.\n\nAll physical exercises and other methodologies taught to students in order to bring them to normal life should be practised at home as well, she said.\n\nJudges A.K. Babulal, K. Karunanidhi, A. Deepa, S. Vipicee and Magistrate M. Seyadhu Sulaiman Ussain took part in the programme.",
