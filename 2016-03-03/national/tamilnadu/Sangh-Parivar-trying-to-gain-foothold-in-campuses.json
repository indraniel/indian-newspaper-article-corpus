    "text": "Communist Party of India (Marxist) Central Committee member U. Vasuki said that the Section 124 A (sedition) of Indian Penal Code need to be repelled to avoid the misuse of \u201ctrying to equate government with nation\u201d and thereby, strangulate the voices of dissent against government.\n\n\u201cThe said IPC Section is nothing but a \u2018colonial relic\u2019 which was used in earlier times to suppress the voices of Indians against the British government. What the present BJP government is doing is to suppress the criticisms against them by terming the criticisers as anti-national\u201d, she added.\n\nMs. Vasuki told this to The Hindu on the sidelines of a street protest organised by the CPI (M) members here on Tuesday to express their dissent over the sedition charges filed against CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yetchury for extending support to JNU students. She came down heavily on Sangh Parivar stating that the outfit is trying to gain foothold in JNU and Hyderabad University campuses by going to the extent of masterminding sedition charges against people who support the students\u2019 causes.\n\nMs. Vasuki quipped that why BJP had an alliance with PDP even after the latter had the view that the hanging of Afzal Guru was a \u2018travesty of justice\u2019. \u201cBy supporting PDP, the BJP should be called \u2018anti-national\u2019 if one goes by the party\u2019s stance on filing sedition charges\u201d. She also wanted to know why sedition charges were not framed against a BJP MP who made a remark that farmers\u2019 suicides were a \u2018fashion\u2019 at a time when it had been a national issue of concern. Ms. Vasuki wanted BJP leader H. Raja to be arrested for his remarks against CPI leader D. Raja on JNU issue, which amounted to inciting violence.",
