Chithoor was killed on the spot in 2009 when the department jeep knocked him down when he was returning from office.\n\nOn hearing an accident claim petition filed by his wife S. Satya, the court directed the primary education department to pay a compensation of Rs. 17 lakh to her.\n\nThe office settled only a part of the claim and kept the remaining amount pending for long. It made the petitioner run from pillar to post for getting the money.\n\nShe approached the court again and filed a contempt petition. The court ordered distraint proceedings against the department, and confiscation of three jeeps, a car, bureaus, computers and fans from the office.\n\nWhen court officials went to the office in the morning, the education department officials assured them that they would pay the remaining amount to the victim\u2019s wife within 15 days.\n\nA worker was killed when department jeep knocked him down when he was returning from office",
