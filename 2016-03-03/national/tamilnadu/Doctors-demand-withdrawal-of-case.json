    "text": "Stating that the case registered under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) against the doctors of Government Hospital in Tiruchengode in a woman\u2019s death be withdrawn and action should not be taken until inquiry report is submitted, doctors threaten to carry out protest here.\n\nSathya (25), wife of Kumar of Kumaramangalam was admitted to the hospital recently where she delivered a baby. But she died immediately after the delivery. Alleging that medical negligence led to her death, relatives staged protest in the hospital. After talks by the police and revenue officials with the protesters, it was decided to alter the sections.\n\nHence, Tiruchengode Town police altered the Section from 174 of Cr.PC to Section 304A and case was registered against doctor Karpaga Selvi and nurse Jothimani.\n\nNamakkal District Government Doctors Association held a meeting in Tiruchengode recently. Its president P. Dhanasekaran and District Nurses Association president Shyamala Devi told reporters that the patient was admitted to the hospital in serious condition and normal delivery was done. But breathing trouble after the delivery led to her death. \u201cWe strongly condemn registering of case against the doctor and nurse. As per the Supreme Court\u2019s direction case under Section 304A cannot be registered without proper investigation. Hence, the case should be withdrawn\u201d, they added.",
