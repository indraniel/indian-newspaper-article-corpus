Gowri, a resident of the Kandaneri village, said all district authorities, from the Collector to various levels of revenue officials, had been petitioned but no steps had been taken to stop sand mining.\n\nSiva Elango, president, Satta Panchayat, said the villagers of Kandaneri were afraid the Palar basin would vanish in a few months, resulting in a setback to agricultural activities; they also expressed concern that they would be robbed of precious drinking water resource.",
