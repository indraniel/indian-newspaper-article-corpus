    "text": "Ward 47 councillor P.V. Subramaniam from the DMK on Monday protested the presence of worms in drinking water in the North Zone Council meeting. He said that he had taken samples of water with worms to the meeting to confront authorities who had been denying any contamination.\n\nWhen he showed bottles in the meeting, the authorities said that it was due to the cleaning of a reservoir in upstream Pilloor in the Nilgiris and that it was rectified. But, he was not ready to buy the officers\u2019 arguments because if that were to be the case all wards getting Pilloor water should get contaminated water. But that was not the case, Mr. Subramaniam said.\n\nHe also said that the residents of Ganapathy Pudur, Kattabomman Street Gandhi Nagar and a few others had been suffering for the past two days. The Corporation should, therefore, stop the contamination to supply clean water from Tuesday.",
