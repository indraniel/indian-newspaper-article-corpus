    "text": "Residents of the Karkovil village have decided to continue and intensify their agitation against the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) drilling activities in their village after the peace meeting held between the villagers and the officials failed to break the logjam on Tuesday.\n\nAt the meeting chaired by Mannargudi RDO Selvasurabhi, the villagers alleged that the ONGC was indulging in shale gas exploration in the garb of natural gas exploitation in the village, an accusation that was stoutly denied by the ONGC side. The officials explained that the two-day stir by the villagers was unwarranted and the residents were being misled. The public side contained among its ranks members of the Movement Against Disaster.\n\nHowever, the meet failed to broker peace between the two sides and the villagers later said that they would intensify their agitation in the days ahead and wanted the ONGC to leave altogether.",
