    "text": "A two-member team of School Education Department conducted enquiry into the complaint that students were being used for cleaning the premises of Jayaprakash Municipal Middle School in Karur.\n\nK.P. Mohan, District Elementary Education Officer, who headed the team, visited the school and conducted enquiry with the Head Master Indira Gandhi and other teachers.\n\nLater, he told The Hindu that it seemed that a few students opened the gate of the school on Tuesday and cleaned a small portion of the premises in the absence of regular sweeper. A decision would be taken on Thursday on taking departmental action against the school officials.\n\nMeanwhile, he had directed the Head Master not to engage students for any work under any circumstances. It was applicable to other schools as well. Action would be taken if the teachers engaged students for carrying out any work other than their academic works.\n\nMr. Mohan said the post of sweeper of Jayaprakash Municipal Middle School was lying vacant. Necessary steps would be taken to solve the issue.",
