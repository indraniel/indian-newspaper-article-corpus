The DMDK has been holding parallel talks with the DMK too but in the eventuality of the alliance coming through, it would be amenable to a junior partner\u2019s role.\n\nThe BJP leadership feels declaring a chief minister candidate in Tamil Nadu might lead to similar demands by allies in other States and may complicate its position.\n\nFurther, there was also the perceived mismatch as far as the base of the parties are concerned, with some leaders expressing concern that the BJP\u2019s urban, middle-class voters may not back such a set up.\n\n\u201cOur stakes are higher in many other States; so, we have to be very cautious in making such a decision in Tamil Nadu. This call will now be taken by national president Amit Shah,\u201d said a senior leader.\n\nOn Wednesday, sources confirmed that the Tamil Nadu BJP had asked Union Minister Prakash Javadekar not to make a trip to the State immediately, indicating that the party might be hardening its stand on the negotiations with the DMDK.\n\n\u201cWe have told Mr. Javadekar let\u2019s wait for the DMDK to open channels again. Without any concrete movement, senior Ministers meeting DMDK leadership again and again may send wrong signals that the BJP is desperate,\u201d said a top state unit leader.\n\nTo demonstrate that it cannot be arm-twisted by potential allies, the BJP has decided to go ahead with receiving applications for all 234 constituencies.\n\nObservers feel the party is in a fix and has little space to manoeuvre. Besides DMDK\u2019s demand, the other possible ally, PMK, has made the chief ministerial candidature of Anbumani Ramadoss non-negotiable. \u201cNobody wants to make compromises,\u201d the leader added. However, the party does not want to alienate potential allies either.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the AIADMK has not opened any channel so far,\u201d said the functionary.\n\nWhatever be the outcome, the party wants to conclude alliance talks by March second week when Mr. Shah is expected to attend a public rally in Tiruchi.\n\nBJP\u2019s State unit has asked Union Minister Prakash Javadekar not to make a trip to the State immediately",
