Narayanapura on Monday.\n\nAccording to police sources, Neha Reddy, the deceased, was a second semester student at New Horizon College and was in a relationship with her classmate Vignesh, who was living with his parents at the Defence Research and Development Organisation quarters. Vignesh is said to have promised to marry her after completing his studies and had even introduced her to his family as his fianc\u00e9e. However, Vignesh\u2019s parents were upset with the idea and told him to focus on studies and stay away from Neha. Later, when Neha confronted Vignesh for avoiding her, the couple broke up. On Monday, Neha went to Vignesh\u2019s house to convince him to change his mind, but the duo had a heated argument. In a fit of anger, Vignesh told Neha that he would not marry her at any cost. Neha walked out of the house, proceeded to the building\u2019s terrace and jumped to her death. The Mahadevapura police have booked a case of abetment to suicide against Vignesh and taken him into custody.",
