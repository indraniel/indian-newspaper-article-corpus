The official was speaking to reporters on the occasion of the project\u2019s inauguration by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu through video conferencing from New Delhi on Tuesday. With the setting up of the project, the Southern Railway has set its sights on the export market potential from the Chennai and Ennore ports.\n\nAround 3.50 lakh units of cars, out of 10 lakh units manufactured at automobile industries in Maraimalai Nagar, Singaperumal Koil, Oragadam and Sriperumbudur are being exported every year through the two ports.\n\nThe cars are now being transported to these two ports by road and it takes multiple trips for automobile companies to finish the delivery of the cars. With the creation of the rail auto hub, around 500 cars could be moved to the port in one trip, which would be beneficial to the manufacturers, Mr. Johri said. Talks with manufacturers have also been initiated to tap the inland traffic by offering logistics service to destinations in other States, the official added.",
