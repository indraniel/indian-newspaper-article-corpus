    "text": "Cultivation of jasmines and marigolds has begun early due to availability of water after rains\n\nThere is no sign of the morning sun on the horizon, but a group of women are already at work on a three-hectare-farmland in Thirukkandalam village, near Red Hills. They pluck jasmine and a few hours later, will be heading to the Koyambedu Wholesale Market to sell these flowers.\n\nThe jasmine has clearly arrived early. It\u2019s only in June\u2013July every year that jasmine will be ready to be plucked.\n\nThe heavy rains in December last year have created a conducive environment for starting cultivation of these flowers early. Since early January, a variety of flowers including jasmine, marigold ( samandi ), firecracker flowers ( kanagambaram ), country rose, tube rose, and cox comb, are being cultivated in small patches of land between large tracts of paddy fields in the northern and western areas of Chennai that border neighbouring Tiruvallur district. These areas include Manjakuppam, Movur, Morur Kandigai, Monnvedu, Monnavedupettai, Othapai, Krishnapuram, Rangaravam, Venkatapuram, Velammakandigai, and Thiruvalankadu.\n\n\u201cUnlike paddy, flowers can be cultivated in a small area with just family members involved in the work. The November \u2013 December 2015 rains filled our wells, and there is enough water to irrigate our fields for an entire year now,\u201d said 52-year-old Thangammal, a jasmine cultivator in Movur village near Avadi. Farmers hold only small parcels of land that are anywhere between three and seven hectares. And, whole families are engaged in flower cultivation.\n\n\u201cAs most flower cultivators are small farmers, the rains helped save on the costs of digging more borewells,\u201d an official with the Department of Horticulture and Plantation Crops told The Hindu.\n\nHorticulture officials said that 14 agriculture extension centres in the district covering major cropping areas like Gummudipoondi, Poonneri, Red Hills, Uthukottai, Tirutani, Pallipattu and Tiruvallur have been coordinating with flower cultivators to ensure modern irrigation methods reach them.\n\n\u201cAll the jasmine sold at Koyambedu wholesale market is said to come from Tiruvallur district. In fact, except for \u2018Bangalore\u2019 roses, which come from Hosur in Krishnagiri district, all the flowers come from Tiruvallur district every day,\u201d said P.K. Krishnan, a flower trader in Koyambedu.",
