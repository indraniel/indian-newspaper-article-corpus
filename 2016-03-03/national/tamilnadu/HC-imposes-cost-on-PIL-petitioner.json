    "text": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 on a petitioner for wasting the court\u2019s time by moving a dubious PIL plea.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a petition moved by M. Sankar, an agriculturist. According to the petitioner, he witnessed a protest staged by a section of nurses while passing through Teynampet and found that they were disappointed from the transfer counselling conducted by the State government as the guidelines have been allegedly violated.\n\nThe petitioner also assailed a Government Order dated November 20, 2007 issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare. Noting that the issue pertaining to the implementation of a government order is nothing but a service dispute between the authorities and the nurses, the Bench said, \u201cThe petitioner knows nothing about the subject, he was a passer-by and has produced only newspaper reports to substantiate his claim.\u201d",
