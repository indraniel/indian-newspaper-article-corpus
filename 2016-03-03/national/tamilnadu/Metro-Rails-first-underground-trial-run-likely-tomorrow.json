The tunnelling and track work got over several months ago. So, we want to check if everything goes well with electrification in this stretch now and carry out trials too,\u201d an official said.\n\nChennai Metro Rail plans to open to the public the first underground stretch between Thirumangalam ramp and Nehru Park by October.\n\nBut the trial run that is likely to happen on Friday will not be done up to Nehru Park as there is quite a bit of work to be completed, sources added.\n\nAlso, on the same day, the trial run between Alandur and Chennai airport will be carried out again with an Overhead Maintenance Vehicle. \u201cOn Tuesday, we did a trial run in one line (upward). Now, on Friday, we may do it on the other line (downward),\u201d an official said.\n\nChennai Metro Rail, which is being built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, commenced its first service in the 10-km stretch between Koyambedu and Alandur in July last year.\n\nCMRL plans to open the next service between Little Mount and Chennai airport in six months.",
