Rangarajan, former chairman of the Prime Minister\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, said.\n\n\u201cThe ease of doing business can be helped by improving or removing the hitches and procedural delays,\u201d Mr. Rangarajan, Chairman of the Madras School of Economics, said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMinimum government is not happening because whatever is happening (in the country) is keeping the government where it is,\u201d he said. The government must focus on maximum governance and ensure that the delivery systems improve, Mr. Rangarajan said.\n\nDelivering the keynote address at a meeting organised by the Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to analyse the recent union budget proposals, Mr. Rangarajan commended Finance Minister Arun Jaitley\u2019s proposals to keep the fiscal deficit at 3.5 per cent of the GDP.\n\nComparing the way fiscal deficit is measured in Europe and India, he said in Europe the fiscal deficit takes into account the Centre and the States and the deficit is 3 per cent, while here if the states are also taken in to account, the deficit would work out to 6 per cent.\n\nThe economist said it was not clear from the budget whether the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission had been included in its expenditure proposals. \u201cIt is possible to defer some of the recommendations, but then the burden will move on to another year, or will they modify the recommendations\u2026 that is not clear,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to a query on the government\u2019s proposal to tax the interest on EPF at retirement, Mr. Rangarajan said the idea, perhaps, was not to tax the corpus but the income.\n\n\u201cApparently the idea is when somebody retires, one should not take out the entire funds. In fact, they want to promote what they call annuities, in the sense that it will come in the form of pension.\u201d\n\nHe also said governments must bring out progress reports on projects for which funds are allocated.",
