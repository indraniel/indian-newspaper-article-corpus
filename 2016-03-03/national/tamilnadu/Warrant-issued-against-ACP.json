Nanthakumar, who was the investigating officer in the case when he served as Inspector of Police at Mandapam police station, had delayed the trial procedure, CJM J. Chandran ordered the issue of warrant.\n\nWhen the case came up for hearing on Tuesday, the CJM noted that the case was pending for long because of the non-appearance of Mr. Nanthakumar, presently ACP, Tirunelveli City, and cited as witness 12 in the case.\n\nHe failed to appear before the court in response to the first summons issued on November 24 last year, the CJM said, adding the police officer had offered no explanation for his absence. He directed the district Superintendent of Police to execute the warrant and produce the police officer before the court before adjourning the case till March 15.\n\nAll the three accused in the case and other witnesses were present when the case came up for hearing on Tuesday, but the trail could not be conducted as Mr. Nanthakumar again failed to respond to the fresh summons.\n\nThe prosecution case was that the three accused had attempted to murder their neighbour Thomas Sanjeevaraj (60) in May, 2014 over a petty quarrel. The police had arraigned four accused in the case, including three siblings, and one died four months after the police had registered a case.",
