Chennai Metro Rail, being built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, started its first service between Koyambedu and Alandur in July last year. As part of the inspection process before the launch, Chennai Metro Rail conducted the first trial run with the vehicle. The trial run with trains is likely to be carried out in a month.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the trial run may be done only after the electrification and signalling are complete on this stretch.\n\nElectrification\n\n\u201cWe began the electrification and signalling sometime ago and hope to complete it soon. The construction of stations is also going well.
