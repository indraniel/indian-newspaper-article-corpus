The AINRC did not implement any welfare programme to raise the living standards of the people, he added.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party is indulging in political gimmicks in laying foundation stones, inaugurations, distribution of welfare assistances in haste. The present government has been indulging in gimmicks which were similar to that of erstwhile Congress regime did in the fear of defeat ahead of last Assembly polls\u201d said Mr. Rajangam.\n\nIn another statement, Mr. Rajangam also warned of agitation against the government if it fails to extend preference to the sportspersons in government employment.",
