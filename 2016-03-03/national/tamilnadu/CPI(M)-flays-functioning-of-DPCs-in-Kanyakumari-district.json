    "text": "After a prolonged struggle by farmers and various associations, the district administration opened direct procurement centres (DPCs) for paddy at Thalakulam, Thazhakudi, Therur, Ozhiginaseri, Kurunthancode and Thirupathisagaram. But they lacked basic facilities such as weighing machines and adequate manpower, said N. Murugesan, district secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n\nIn a release, he said that paddy with over 18 per cent moisture content was not procured. Since Kanyakumari district had unique climatic conditions with more moisture, even paddy with more than 20 per cent moisture content should be procured. People\u2019s Welfare Front would stage in front of the Collectorate on Friday demanding proper functioning of DPCs, repairing badly damaged roads, replacing new buses for worn-out vehicles and arresting downfall of rubber prices.",
