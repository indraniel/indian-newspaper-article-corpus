    "text": "The police are planning to set up a police museum at the department-owned Hamilton Club on State Bank Road where renovation works are underway. Renovation of the 3,488 sq ft building, which was remaining unused for more than a decade, began on Sunday.\n\nMore than Rs. 50 lakh will be spent to restore its colonial beauty.\n\nA team of senior archaeologists and a sculptor are working on restoring the building (that was named after the British officer F.A. Hamilton who bought it for the department) using the same type of materials that were used for its construction.\n\nEfforts are on to restore the Madras terrace and Mangalore tiles, repair the pillars, plaster the walls and mend the doors and windows. It was earlier planned to be used for the police personnel.\n\n\u201cWe have just stumbled on the idea of having a museum there and are trying to get ideas on going about it,\u201d said City Police Commissioner A. Amalraj.\n\nIf it materialises, this would be the first police museum in the State that would be open to the public. The police museum in Chennai is not open to the public.\n\nDepartment sources said that the proposed museum could be in such as way that the general public would be able to realise how the police have evolved over the years from the colonial era.\n\nIt would house weaponry and the uniforms used by officers in yesteryears, photographs of colonial officers who served in this region, and a collection of antique materials that would depict the evolution of the department.",
