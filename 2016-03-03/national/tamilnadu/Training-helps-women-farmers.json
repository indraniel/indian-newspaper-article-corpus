They were provided orientation on a new drying method based on osmosis - dipping the whole or sliced fruit in sugar solution and putting it through hot-air drying. They were trained in packaging the chips to retain the flavour for months.\n\nThe farmers could expand their horizon of thinking beyond producing just tender coconuts, coconuts and copra.\n\nThey not only learnt about devoting more attention to the crops and pest management practices, but also value addition through exposure to various products, Assistant Director of Agriculture Modakurichi Kulandaivelu, who escorted the team, said.\n\nThere were also members in the team who were already into manufacturing virgin coconut oil who gained insights into making their ventures more profitable.\n\nTheir learning also included coconut-based integrated farming system.\n\nThe Interstate training - Integrated Crop Management in Coconut, was sponsored by the State Government under the aegis of 'Submission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE), Support to State Extension Program for Extension Reforms (SSEPERS) and Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA), he said.",
