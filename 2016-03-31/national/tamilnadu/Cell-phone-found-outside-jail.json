However, it hit the long boundary wall of the prison and fell outside.\n\nThe parcel was noticed by Chief Head Warder M. Kalyanasundaram while reporting for duty at around 9 p.m. on Tuesday. Sources said the packet was found lying outside the boundary wall between two watch towers situated on the northern side of jail. He handed it over to the Jailor who in turn brought the issue to the notice of the Superintendent of Prison A. Murugesan.\n\nOThe consignment was reportedly meant for some inmate.",
