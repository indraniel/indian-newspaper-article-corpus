    "text": "The SFI has demanded stringent action against A. Manimeghalai, a teacher in Government High School at Iduvai, for sending Class IX student R. Krishnasamy to bring tea for teachers, which resulted in him getting injured in a road accident last week. \u201cPrompt action against the erring teachers alone will act as deterrent for others from repeating the offence. Accusations are already there that teachers in many schools used children to carry out their personal works, due to the absence of sub-staff in the offices\u201d, SFI district secretary R. Vimal told The Hindu.",
