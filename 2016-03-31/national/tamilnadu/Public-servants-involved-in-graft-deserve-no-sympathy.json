    "text": "Challenging the acquittal of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case by the Karnataka High Court, BJP leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday argued in the Supreme Court that no leniency should be shown to a public servant involved in corruption.\n\n\u201cThere is no room for leniency in prosecuting corruption cases, especially of public servants holding high positions,\u201d Mr. Swamy submitted before a Bench of Justices P.C. Ghose and Amitava Roy.\n\nThe day also saw senior advocate B.V. Acharya appearing for Karnataka government concluding his arguments on the appeal challenging the High Court verdict. Mr. Acharya submitted that the source of money for purchase of several properties under scanner in the case was one (Jayalalithaa). He said the transactions were \u201ccamouflaged\u201d by using different names so that the source of money would not lead to Ms. Jayalalithaa.\n\nIn his submissions, Mr. Swamy said it was imperative for the apex court to decide whether or not the income and wealth calculations by Karnataka High Court was acceptable.\n\nHe questioned the role of the Superintendent of Police of Tamil Nadu, who was the sole respondent from the appeal stage before the High Court till the end of proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe issue is whether the judicial process was subverted or not by the vitiating circumstances of the appointment of the sole public prosecutor from Tamil Nadu,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides Jayalalithaa, others acquitted by the High Court were her close aide Sasikala and her two relatives, V.N. Sudhakaran and Elavarasi.",
