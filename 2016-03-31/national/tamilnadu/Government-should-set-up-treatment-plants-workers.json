    "text": "Stating that closure of textile processing units in Pallipalayam and Komarapalayam is affecting the livelihood of workers, trade unions demand that the proposed common effluent treatment plants be established at the earliest.\n\nA resolution passed at a meeting of the Namakkal District Power Loom Workers Union stated that about 35,000 workers were directly or indirectly employed with over 400 small and medium sized dyeing units \u2013 both authorised and unauthorised \u2013 in Pallipalayam and Komarapalayam.\n\nRecently officials of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board raided units in these areas and found that many units were discharging effluents directly into River Cauvery.\n\nThese units were closed by the officials leading to unemployment of many workers. The resolution urged the Centre and the State to provide compensation to the workers, and establish the treatment plant as proposed earlier.\n\nThey said that these unit owners were unable to buy the land for establishing the plants as the land prices were very high. Hence, the government should establish the plant.\n\nWorkers would stage a protest in Pallipalayam on April 2, and at Komarapalayam on April 4.",
