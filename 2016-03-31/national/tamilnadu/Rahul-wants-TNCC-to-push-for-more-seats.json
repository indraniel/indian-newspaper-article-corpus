    "text": "Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi has reportedly instructed the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee not to settle for too few seats in the DMK alliance and push harder in the negotiations.\n\nHowever, DMK sources ruled out the possibility of sparing 63 seats, the number it gave the Congress in 2011. \u201cWe are ready to add one or two seats to the 30 we offered. But 63 is impossible,\u201d said a senior DMK leader. Congress sources said TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan met Mr. Gandhi in New Delhi on Wednesday and communicated the offer of the DMK. The meeting also involved senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mukul Wasnik. Mr. Elangovan and Mr. Azad held a long discussion on Tuesday night as well, sources added.\n\nMr. Gandhi apparently feels that settling for a very low number would only hurt the party's image. But the TNCC has also communicated to him that given the situation that the party finds itself in Tamil Nadu, going alone may not be a good decision, said a source on condition of anonymity.\n\nHowever, what has really upset the TNCC was the DMK's decision to allocate five seats each to IUML and MMK. \u201cCompared to those parties, the Congress is way stronger and has a presence across the State,\u201d the leader said.\n\nDMK sources said it would take a few more days to finalise the seat-sharing agreement with the Congress.",
