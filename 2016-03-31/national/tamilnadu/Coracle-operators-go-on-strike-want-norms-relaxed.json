The operators have demanded that the number of passengers on coracle be increased from four persons to six.\n\nRound-the-year service\n\nThey also want round-the-year coracle service as opposed to the administration\u2019s caveats based on water level in Cauvery river.\n\nSimilarly, they have also demanded increase in timing of coracle operation hours from 7 a.m to 6 p.m as opposed to the current timing of 10 a.m to 5 p.m.\n\nThe norms came into place in September last after a coracle capsized killing six members of a family.\n\nIntermittent strikes\n\nCoracleoperators, who initially came around to accepting the norms, however, have been on intermittent strikes demanding that the norms be relaxed especially on certain key points, including permission for children to go on rides.\n\nHowever, the administration had refused to reduce the permissible age down from seven years.",
