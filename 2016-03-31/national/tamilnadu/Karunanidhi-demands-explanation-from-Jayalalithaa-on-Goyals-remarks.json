    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Wednesday asked Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to come out with an explanation to Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s allegation that he was not able to discuss power projects for the State with her as she was inaccessible.\n\nIn a statement here, Mr. Karunanidhi said instead of responding directly to Mr Goyal\u2019s charges, Ms. Jayalalithaa made two Ministers of her Cabinet to issue denials. \u201cBut the Ministers only launched personal attacks and never bothered to reply to the issues raised by Mr. Goyal,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi rejected the argument that Ms. Jayalalithaa had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Ministers eight times. \u201cActually she met Mr Modi immediately after he assumed office. On other occasions, Mr. Modi and others called on her in Chennai or she met them at public functions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief Minister should come out openly why she denied an appointment to Mr. Goyal.\n\n\u201cAnother Union Minister Prakash Javadekar also has said he could not meet Ms. Jayalalithaa. I wonder whether O. Pannerselvam and Natham R. Viswanathan can get an audience with the Chief Minister,\u201d Mr. Karunanidhi said.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, the AIADMK government has not implemented any scheme for the development of the State. It also failed to utilise the help rendered by the Centre,\u201d the DMK chief alleged.",
