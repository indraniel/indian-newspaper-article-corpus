It would only bring shame and disgrace to the six-decade-old party.\n\nIf the DMK did not stop such activities, it would face a similar fate after the elections as thousands of DMK cadres would come into the DMDK fold.\n\nAddressing an election campaign meeting here on Wednesday, she expressed concern over the defection by a DMDK district secretary, Yuvaraj, for the DMK recently, she stated that Vijayakant wished to keep with him all his cadres and persons who were with him in his early days. Tamil Nadu would give a fitting lesson to betrayers. \u201cI have seen brightness on the face of Stalin only today. It is temporary happiness. It will not last long. The DMK will also face the music for its cheap politics. People will make defectors a symbol of disgrace,\u201d she said.\n\nHitting hard at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her government, Ms. Premalatha said that Ms. Jayalalithaa was an illusion. People would no longer believe her illusory words. She did nothing except announcing several schemes under rule 110 in the Assembly. They were of no use to people, she said.\n\nShe also announced that only Mr. Vijayakant would announce the names of Ministers after the elections.\n\nAgriculture and handlooms would be the two eyes of the DMDK government, she said.\n\n\u201cPulling\u201d DMDK party functionaries to its fold would only bring shame and disgrace to the six-decade-old party: Premalatha",
