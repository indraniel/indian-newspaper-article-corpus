But this \u2018Congress factionalism\u2019 is one that has surely gone unnoticed.\n\nThus was birth of \u201cCongress Jananayaga Makkal Katchi,\u201d- a yet to be registered \u2018political party\u201d by M.S. Buthan of Harur, after the man arrived in Dharmapuri, with three other family members. Having made the announcement through the media groups on Whatsapp, Mr. Buthan, who claims to have been a Congressman for decades, however, had decided to float his own party, only with none to witness the event.\n\nHowever, a confident Mr. Buthan has pledged his \u201cparty\u201d support to the AIADMK. His first task was to mobilise 20,000 members, a number way below the votes required to retain the deposit.",
