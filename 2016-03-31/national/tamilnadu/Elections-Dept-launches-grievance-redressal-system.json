Candavelou here on Wednesday.\n\nTalking to reporters, he said that \u2018Samadhan\u2019 is a public grievance redressal system conceptualised as a comprehensive system with multiple modes for receiving complaints online, through SMS, email, mobile, fax and post. \u2018Suvidha\u2019 is a single window system for candidates and political parties to apply for various permissions.\n\nMr. Candavelou said that as many as 15 cases had been registered for violation of model code of conduct so far. The flying squads had so far seized Rs.20 lakh in cash and handed it over to the Income Tax department.\n\nThe Union Territory will have 930 polling stations for the May 16 Assembly elections. Of these 140 polling stations have been identified as sensitive.\n\nThe administration has sought deployment of paramilitary forces in these polling booths, Mr. Candavelou said.\n\nThe Elections department has identified differently-abled persons in each polling station. Wheelchairs would be provided to these stations for their convenience. Volunteers would also be deputed to these polling stations to help differently-abled persons, he added.\n\nVoters in the Union Territory have been asked to verify whether their names are in the voters list. If they are unable to locate it till April 19, they have been asked to submit applications to get them added.",
