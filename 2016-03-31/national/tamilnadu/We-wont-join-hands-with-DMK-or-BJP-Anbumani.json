    "text": "The Pattali Makkal Katchi would not join hands with either the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the BJP, said party\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss. Talking to press persons here on Tuesday night, he said that the PMK would face the election alone as it had been enjoying the support of women, youth and all sections of people across the State. \u201cThe AIADMK cannot dream of returning to power. The DMK has already lost the confidence of people. The People\u2019s Welfare Front can\u2019t be considered a political alliance as it remains a non-starter,\u201d he said. Referring to Union Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s statement that he could not meet Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Dr. Anbumani said that other Central Ministers too faced similar problems with the Chief Minister, but they did not reveal it.\n\nEarlier, interacting with a cross section of people in Dindigul and Theni districts, Dr. Anbumani said that a government medical college for Dindigul did not materialise as the AIADMK government abandoned the proposal since it was made by the DMK. The DMK too abandoned many good schemes proposed by the AIADMK. The PMK would establish a government medical college in each district, he said. Ruling out distribution of freebies to the public, he reiterated that agricultural inputs and solar water pumps would be given to farmers free of cost. He said he would offer basic services such as quality education and health care to the public.",
