    "text": "New system is likely to take off from mid-April\n\nManually written First Information Report (FIR) copy being issued to complaints by the police would soon become a thing of the past. Police stations across the State would start issuing computer-generated FIRs to complainants most likely from mid-April.\n\nWith police stations equipped with necessary paraphernalia such as computer terminals and printers, the issue of computer-generated FIRs to complaints is poised to take the police administration to the next level.\n\nStation House Officers, Sub Inspectors and Station Writers of the central zone encompassing eight districts were given an orientation regarding the system and its salient features.\n\nOfficers from the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) were entrusted with the task of providing an orientation to the field level police officers of these districts over the last few days.\n\nDuring the course of the orientation, the SCRB team expressed its readiness to train additional staff in police stations in computer operations in order to ensure that there was a back up person in every police station to key in information and take print outs of computer-generated FIRs. Three to four computers and a couple of printers were provided to police stations to issue computer-generated FIRs to court, complaint and the investigation officer concerned. The FIR is the first base document to set the criminal law in motion empowering a police officer to investigate a criminal case. Investigation is collection of evidence, both documentary and oral, say police sources.\n\nThe FIR would disclose the commission of cognizable offence, say the sources adding that based on this primary document the investigators would launch the probe so as to bring the case to its logical end in the course of time. The main copy of the computer-generated FIR would be submitted to the court and its copy would be given free of cost to the complaint by obtaining a written acknowledgement from them.\n\nThe FIR copies would be in possession of investigation officer concerned, the police station concerned for file and one in the office of the Deputy Superintendent of Police. The FIR would have security features. It would be legible than a manually written one besides offering scope to rectify mistakes then and there in the system while the information was being keyed in the terminal, a senior officer said.\n\nField-level police officers in the central zone given orientation on the new system",
