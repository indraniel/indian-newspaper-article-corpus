Singaravelou\n\nMinute details of rock art forms decorate the dark strokes of masks in his paintings. Artist K. Mounissamy has resolved to carry the message of saving rock art forms through his paintings.\n\nThe walls of Hotel Maison Perumal of CGH Earth Group on Perumal Koil Street are decorated with his paintings. For the Puducherry-born artist, it is an opportunity to create awareness of the dying art form. \u201cWe are destroying our rocks and caves, which preserve these traditional art works. I want to create awareness of treasuring these paintings through my work. Hence, I replicate the rock art in my paintings,\u201d he said.\n\nBright coloured masks are his favourite. In different sizes and colours, these masks are portrayed on the canvas reflecting his obsession with the human face.\n\n\u201cEvery human being is different. They react to things differently and it is interesting to bring those emotions on the canvas,\u201d he says.\n\nHaving completed a two-year diploma in fine arts in Puducherry, he has exhibited his paintings in solo shows at Sega Contemporary Art Gallery, Elements Art Gallery, The Promenade and Maison Perumal. Mr.Mounissamy uses mixed media in his art works. The painting exhibition will be on till April 23.",
