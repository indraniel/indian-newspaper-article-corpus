    "text": "A conman reportedly made away with about 10 sovereigns of gold from a house near Old Perungalathur on Monday evening after posing as an EB worker. The police said the man hoodwinked S. Agoram (79), living alone at Parvathi Nagar.\n\n\u201cThe man was well-groomed and talked politely. He said there was an error in the machine and that it might cost him Rs. 15,000 to have the meter replaced. He said that instead, if some gold was kept on the meter, it would stop working,\u201d said a police officer. Mr. Agoram handed over six gold bangles and, after wrapping them in a newspaper, the man asked for water. When Mr. Agoram returned with the water, he immediately drank it and left the house. It was then that he realised that the jewels kept on the meter board were missing.",
