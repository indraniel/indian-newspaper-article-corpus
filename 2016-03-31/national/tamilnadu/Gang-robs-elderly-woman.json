The victim, Meenakshi, was a widow and cannot walk without assistance.\n\nAccording to police sources, five persons went to her house and offered help to fix her faulty air-conditioner on Tuesday evening.

The police have arrested two persons in connection with the case at Kanuvai on Wednesday morning.\n\nThey were identified as R. Sundar (21), a college student, and K. Rajaram (20), a plumber.
