The political parties should apply to the Returning Officer concerned for events to be held in the next seven days (excluding the day of application) or at least 48 hours before the event along with expenditure plan.\n\nThe release also said that an online facility had been created for political parties to apply for various permissions.\n\nThey would have to file separate applications for every event they planned to hold. The officials in the office of the Returning Officer would obtain permission from other departments, if necessary, and would grant or deny permission within 36 hours of the submission of the application forms.\n\nThe release added that the cell would give permission exclusively for political events and those wanting permission for non-political events could get those from the police.",
