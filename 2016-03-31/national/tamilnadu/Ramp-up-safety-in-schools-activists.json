He was beaten by a 12-year-old boy studying in the same school.\n\n\u201cBased on our study, we found that the school where the incident happened had over 1,500 students but adequate safety measures were not in place. Students would come to school as early as 7.45 a.m. though classes started only at 8.30 and there was absolutely no adult supervision either by faculty or non-teaching staff such as the watchmen there,\u201d said Thomas Jayaraj, Director of the Centre for Child Rights and Development.\n\nStating that the school at present had watchmen as well as CCTV cameras installed, S. Thengapandian, who headed the committee, posed a question as to why those measures were not in place before.\n\n\u201cTo create a safe environment at school and discourage such student behaviour, educational institutions should have counsellors,\u201d he pointed out, and said that there had been an increase in such incidents where students displayed aggressive behaviour that put those around them at risk.\n\nThe fact-finding committee also stressed on the need to have better infrastructure in schools to ensure that the environment there was safe.\n\n\u201cThe 12-year-old student assaulted the younger boy with stones collected from debris that were unnecessarily piled up on school campus. This could have been avoided,\u201d said C. Nambi, Executive Director of CSED.",
