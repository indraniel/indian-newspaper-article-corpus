    "text": "Inspired by the Election Commission\u2019s target of achieving 100 per cent polling in the May 16 Assembly elections, an association of vocational teachers in the State has vouched to get its members and their families cast their vote without fail.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Vocational Teachers Kazhagam, during its executive committee meeting held recently, passed a resolution to ensure that vocational teachers across the State and their family members cast their votes in the elections.\n\nBut this is not the first time that the association is promoting voting among its members. \u201cWe campaigned for the same during the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and Assembly elections in 2011. We have been continuously motivating our teachers to exercise their voting rights during elections. About 70 to 80 per cent of our teachers voted in these elections,\u201d S.N. Janarthanan, State general secretary of the association said.\n\nThere are 5,000 vocational teachers in the State. The association will send circulars to its office-bearers in all the districts. They will meet vocational teachers in their respective districts and encourage them to vote without fail, he added. \u201cEarlier, we sent SMSes to teachers saying cast your vote without fail. This time, we will see if Whatsapp can be used for the purpose,\u201d he said. The teachers would be explained that voting was their right and duty.",
