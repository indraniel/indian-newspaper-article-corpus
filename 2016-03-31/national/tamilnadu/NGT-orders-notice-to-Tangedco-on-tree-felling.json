    "text": "The National Green Tribunal\u2019s Southern Bench here has ordered issuing of notice to Tangedco on an application which sought to stop the cutting of trees in Tiruverkadu near here for installing overhead power lines.\n\nWhen the application filed by VGN Mahalakshmi Nagar Owner \u2013 Residents Welfare Association of Perumalagaram came up for hearing, the Bench comprising Justice P. Jyothimani and expert member P.S. Rao ordered issuing of notice and posted the matter to April 6.\n\nThe application claimed that the area had a canopy of greenery and Tangedco was trying to install high-tension lines there.\n\nTangedco was also trying to cut over 50 trees for installing the line.\n\nIf the trees are cut down, it would affect the environment as several birds had made them their homes. It would also affect the ambience of the place, the application said.\n\nReferring to two representations made to the authorities, the application further suggested that instead of overhead lines, underground lines could be laid.",
