    "text": "Allegations of corruption and other misdemeanours that had been levelled against the Bharathiar University had hurt its image but it was trying to get over it, said Vice Chancellor A. Ganapathi at a press meet here on Wednesday.\n\nThe latest development \u2013 the University getting a National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) rating of 3.11 \u2013 was a morale booster.\n\nThe University in fact could have scored 3.25 but the baggage of the past had brought down the score.\n\nThe University was also trying to improve its research programmes and encourage its faculty to contribute more research papers.\n\nThe University had applied for 12 patents. It was also improving upon the suggestions the NAAC team gave after the second round of assessment.\n\nThe University was in the process of developing curriculum, initiating open source learning, providing seed money for research to young faculty, strengthening alumni network and encouraging faculty to write in foreign journals.\n\nMr. Ganapathi said that the University was also taking steps to improve faculty strength in various departments so that they were eligible for the special assistance project fund.\n\nFor a department to be eligible for the funds it needs to have a minimum of six faculty members.\n\nAllegation against warden\n\nIn response to a question on allegations against the hostel chief warden, he said that he had received a note without signature. He would study the contents and then act on it, if necessary.\n\nUniversity is also taking steps to improve faculty strength in various departments",
