    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has dismissed an appeal preferred by a nationalised insurance company challenging a compensation of Rs. 13.21 lakh awarded by a motor accident claims tribunal to a 15-year-old cyclist who lost his left leg and his co-traveller, an 18-month-old infant who suffered severe injuries when a lorry knocked them down, way back in June 2003.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam rejected the appeal after holding that the tribunal had arrived at a just and reasonable compensation since the prime victim, just 15 years old at the time of the accident, had lost his left leg affecting his earning capacity and the child travelling along with him on the bicycle too had suffered a minor disability besides pain and suffering.",
