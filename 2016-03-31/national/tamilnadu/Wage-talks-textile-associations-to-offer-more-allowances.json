    "text": "In the wage revision talks held on Wednesday between the eight trade unions and six textile associations, there has been some improvements and it looked optimistic that the wage agreement could be finalised during the next round of talks scheduled for April 6.\n\nBoth the trade unions and textile associations eased their stance considerably on Wednesday to facilitate speedy signing of the new wage agreement. Trade union representatives who attended the closed door talks said they had now come down from the demand for 100 per cent hike in basic wages made in the earlier rounds of talks to 50 per cent. At the same time, textile associations too eased their positions a bit and agreed to increase dearness allowance, travel allowance, overtime allowance and compensation for workers who die in harness.\n\nHowever, the knitwear unit owners continued to maintain that they would give only 27 per cent increase in the basic wages over a period of four years.\n\nM. Chandran, state secretary of CITU, was optimistic that the stalemate would be over during the next round of talks on April 6 as positive signs were there all through the talks held on the day.",
