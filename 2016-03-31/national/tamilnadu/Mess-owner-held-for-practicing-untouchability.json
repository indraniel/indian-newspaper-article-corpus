    "text": "An owner of a mess at Kempanaickenpalayam against whom a case was registered under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act - 2015, a few days ago, based on a complaint preferred by a Dalit youth that he had prevented his friends from entering the dining area abusing them by caste name, has been arrested.\n\nAccording to the complaint preferred by Rajendran, Komarasamy had told him that upper caste people will stop patronising the mess if he allowed his friends inside.\n\nThe mess is located close to the Kempanaickenpalayam bus stop.\n\nThe first information report, however, states that Rajendran was having food in the mess when his friends were refused entry.\n\nThe mess owner had reportedly denied the charge and had told the police that he had only asked the youth not to create a ruckus in the mess in an inebriated state.\n\nThe police said that on an average three cases pertaining to Protection of Civil Rights Act were being registered in police stations in Sathy taluk on a regular basis, and action was taken promptly.\n\nWhether or not the allegations are true, when a complaint is preferred under the Act, the case must necessarily be registered under the Act, the official said.\n\nFarmers in villages in Bangalapudur limits have, in the past, complained about what they termed as misuse of the provisions of the Act and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Farmers in Kallipatti, Kondayampalayam, Chinnakaliyur, Valayampalaiam, Erangakattur and Perumugai villages had also represented to the district administration saying a vested interest group was indulging in harassment with the threat of implicating them such Acts.",
