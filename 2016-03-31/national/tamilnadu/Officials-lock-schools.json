    "text": "TDTA Primary School and Christ Church Nursery School, located on Shanthi Nagar CSI Christ Church premises, which would function as polling booths during the May 16 Assembly elections, were locked by two Corporation officials on Wednesday as they had not constructed ramps for the benefit of differently abled voters.\n\nThe Election Commission has mandated creation of ramps in all polling booths. As this facility is yet to be created at these schools, a team of Corporation officials, who inspected the schools on Tuesday afternoon, instructed the school authorities to construct ramps.\n\nThe officials also reportedly instructed the school authorities to construct a few more toilets in addition to the existing lone toilet.\n\nEven as classes were in progress on Wednesday morning, two Corporation officials came there and sought explanation from the school authorities for not constructing the ramp and more toilets. Then, after asking the teachers and the students to leave classrooms, they locked the schools and took the keys with them.\n\nAfter informing the correspondent of the development, the teachers started taking classes inside the church.\n\nThe issue was sorted out only after the church management committee brought the issue to the notice of Collector and District Election Officer M. Karunakaran, who ordered immediate return of classroom keys to the school authorities.",
