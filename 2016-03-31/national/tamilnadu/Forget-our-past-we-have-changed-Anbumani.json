    "text": "Seeking to break away from the party\u2019s contentious past, Pattali Makkal Katchi\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss on Wednesday affirmed that the party\u2019s past was behind them and it has changed for the better.\n\n\u201cAny organisation has a past; the BJP\u2019s roots could be traced to the RSS. Our past is over. Change is for us too; we have changed and stand for progress,\u201d he declared. He was speaking at \u201cUngal Oor, Ungal Anbamani,\u2019 an interactive session with residents of Tiruchi and Karur to discuss issues relating to the two districts.\n\nDr. Anbumani\u2019s statement came in response to a city resident who observed that though he could be acceptable to many, the words and deeds of his party men were a put off. \u201cHave you seen any of our partymen speaking or acting in deviant manner over the past one or two years? We may not be perfect. But we have definitely changed,\u201d Dr.Anbumani said.\n\nHe also promised to consider the \u201clong pending\u201d demand for making Tiruchi the second capital of the State if his party was voted to power. \u201cWe will study the demand with the help of experts,\u201d he said and added that some of the departments could be decentralised.\n\nThough Tiruchi was centrally located, the previous governments have not exploited the advantage and the city has seen little development in terms of infrastructure and basic amenities.\n\nSome of the popular demands from city residents such as establishment of an integrated bus stand, which he said has not come up due to the political rivalry and petty politics between the two Dravidian majors, expansion of the airport, building a ring road, upgradation of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital as a super specialty hospital and laying of service roads along Thanjavur highway would be addressed if the PMK was voted to power. He also promised to promote agro-economic zones for banana and drumstick processing and exports in the Tiruchi-Karur region. Cooperatives would also be promoted for specific farm and marine products, he said.",
