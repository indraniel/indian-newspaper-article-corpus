    "text": "Bus passengers continue to face hardships, as drivers violate traffic rules at many places in the city.\n\nSuch violations are quite evident near the Collectorate and government hospital.\n\nBuses are stopped in the middle of the road, and passengers are forced to get down so that drivers can overtake other buses. This disrupts the traffic, and pose a threat to the lives of other road users too.\n\nMany commuters complain of speeding private buses.\n\nThe police warn drivers, which is ignored often. The Collectorate junction is the busiest in the city where roads leading to Yercaud, Old Bus Stand, Market, New Bus Stand intercepts. Though a bus stop is present in front of the Collectorate, drivers stop the vehicles at will, and force passengers to get down.",
