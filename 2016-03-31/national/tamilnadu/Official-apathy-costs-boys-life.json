    "text": "The apathy of the Corporation administration in addressing the grievances of Dhanalakshmi Nagar residents for long has resulted in the death of a one-year-and-three-months-old boy on Tuesday night.\n\nSridhar, son of Ramesh, a tailor, and Sathya, drowned in the sewage collection unit located in the hamlet. The accident could have been prevented if the authorities had put a mesh at the intersection where the drain that carry the waste water into the collection unit, as demanded by the residents for the past three years. \u201cWe have staged many agitations in the last three years demanding removal of sewage on a daily basis from the collection point. Also, our requests to put an interlaced structure where the sewage from the houses drain into the collection unit for avoiding any mishaps did not get any response from the administration\u201d, V. Sivasankar, secretary of Residents Association of the area, told The Hindu .\n\nAccording to the residents, more than 75,000 litres of sewage from over 600 houses in the hamlet falls into the collection point every day. \u201cCorporation officials usually suck out and take away only a very insignificant portion of the sewage as they cite shortage of adequate tanker lorries for the purpose\u201d, they alleged. Though Collector S. Jayandhi and senior Corporation officials, who visited the hamlet on Wednesday, assured prompt steps for a permanent solution to redress the grievances, the residents are keeping their fingers crossed.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is action not mere assurances as done in the past\u201d, said the residents.",
