    "text": "Reiterating that history had proved that multi-cornered contest had always worked in his party\u2019s favour, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Wednesday said alternative politics and third front were only imaginary and outdated concepts.\n\n\u2018DMK will win\u2019\n\n\u201cTamil Nadu has seen the DMK and AIADMK alternatively forming governments. If one goes by the outcome of the elections since 1989, it is clear that the DMK will win the forthcoming polls,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe said a few political leaders have launched a campaign aimed at diluting the truth that the DMK was the only alternative to the AIADMK.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi said whenever the DMK was in power, it had implemented welfare schemes and these were always fresh in the minds of the people. \u201cThat is why people always vote for the DMK in the election when the AIADMK is in power,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi said the ruling party had hatched a conspiracy against the DMK as the existing circumstances were not congenial for it; it had roped in a few to launch a campaign, equating the DMK with the AIADMK.\n\n\u201cA few politicians and media persons have turned a blind eye to the excesses and inefficiency of the AIADMK and chosen to target the DMK,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Election a challenge\u2019\n\nMr .Karunanidhi added that the election was a challenge and the party cadres should ensure victory in at least in two constituencies in smaller districts (party districts numbering 65) and three to four constituencies in bigger districts.",
