We may be able to use it for various functions including running of escalators, lifts and other such purposes,\u201d an official said.\n\nRamya Gopinath of Solar Mango, a solar energy consulting firm said aiding the supply of electricity with solar power is a great initiative for mass rapid transit.\n\n\u201c1MW may not be huge investment for a mass rapid transit like Chennai Metro Rail; but it is a good startWith 1MW, they can meet up to 30 per cent of the total energy requirement. But it will help to a great extent only if they eventually increase the production capacity. It will be better if they at least go up to 3 MW,\u201d she said.\n\nDelhi Metro Rail had exploited this resource to such an extent that they were given an award for the highest capacity installation of grid connected solar power plants on rooftops last year.\n\nThey have commissioned about 2,000 KWP of rooftops solar plants and also signed a power purchase agreement for another 7MW capacity.\n\nIn December, they signed an MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of India for production of 500MW for catering to its upcoming phase III project.\n\nSimilarly, Bangalore Metro Rail too has made plans to exploit solar energy potential in its station premises.\n\nThe power panels will generate 1MW that will take care of 30 per cent of energy requirement",
