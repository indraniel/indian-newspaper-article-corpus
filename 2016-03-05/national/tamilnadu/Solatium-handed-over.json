Balachandar\n\nA day after Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced solatium of Rs. 5 lakh each to the 11 fishermen held in Iran for three months after they were arrested by its Coast Guard and released on Wednesday, Fisheries Minister K. A. Jayapal presented the cheques to the fishermen here on Friday.\n\nAccompanied by Minister for Sports and Youth Welfare S. Sundararaj, Fisheries Minister distributed the cheques to the fishermen in the presence of Collector S. Natarajan at a brief function at the Collectorate. \u201cThe relief was timely and more than what we expected,\u201d V. Arumugam, one of the released fishermen said. They were overwhelmed by the assistance as they were out of job for three months and returned home empty handed after they were set free by the Iranian government on Wednesday, he said.\n\nM. Karunamurthy, district secretary of CITU-affiliated Tamil Nadu Meenpidi Thozhirsanga Koottammaippu, who spearheaded agitations to secure the release of the fishermen, said the assistance came in handy for families of the fishermen, which faced abject poverty after their breadwinners went jobless for three months.\n\nFor many families, the fishermen were the sole breadwinners he said and appealed to the Centre and State governments to secure their passports from their Dubai-based contractor. The fishermen who were in contract fishing for long could support their families only if they were helped to visit Dubai again, he said.",
