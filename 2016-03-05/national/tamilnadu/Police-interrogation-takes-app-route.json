    "text": "A mobile translation app enables questioning of Romanian national in ATM fraud case\n\nWhen language was a barrier to carrying out the interrogation of a foreign national in connection with a crime, the police found a way out of the problem through technology.\n\nThe Guindy police used a mobile translation application to interrogate Romanian national Irimia Ionut (33) who was arrested by the Guindy police on March 1 on the charge of fixing a slimmer in an ATM on Anna Salai.\n\nTwo of his Romanian friends, who came to the city with him, are absconding.\n\n\u201cInitially, we found it difficult to understand what he was saying as he was not speaking in English. Then, Assistant Commissioner Shankaralingam, inspector A. Kannan and sub-inspector K.R. Rajendran decided to use a mobile application to translate what he was saying,\u201d said a police source.\n\nThe police downloaded the application, typed the question in English and got it translated into Romanian and then showed it to him. \u201cHe typed his answer and we translated it into English,\u201d added the source. Thanks to the app, the police came to know that he and two of his friends had come down to the city on 24, 25 and 26 of February, on tourist visa. \u201cBy the time we reached Uthandi, where they were staying, his friends had escaped,\u201d said a police officer.\n\n\u201cHe did not like Indian food and we did not know what to get him. So we spent around Rs. 1,200 to get him two pizzas,\u201d said the officer. Meanwhile, the police have requested that the passports of the accused be blocked.",
