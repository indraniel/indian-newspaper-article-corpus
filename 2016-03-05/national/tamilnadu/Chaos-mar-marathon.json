    "text": "Chaos and confusion prevailed from the start to the finish of the My India marathon 2016 at the Codissia grounds here on Friday.\n\nSania Mirza was roped in as the special guest for the event, which was aimed at creating awareness for 100 per cent vote polling. But it turned out to be the other way round with the celebrity star speaking nothing about it.\n\nEarlier, even before the sun could come out, both the young and the old, gathered at the venue to take part in the marathon. After an half hour delay, they enthusiastically ran the distance but when the organisers declared the results a few parents raised their voice in protest saying that their wards did not find a place in the list despite finishing on top.\n\nThere were some who blamed the route markings. The officials concerned stood strong but the parents were not willing to budge. Finally, the dust settled down with the arrival of Sania but not before an hour\u2019s wait for the sponsors, special guests, and the winners.\n\nAt the Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, the management, staff and students waited eagerly for over two hours under the scorching sun only to find Sania spending just a few minutes. But the students felt it was worth the wait.",
