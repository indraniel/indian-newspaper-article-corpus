Vinayaka Missions Medical College, Karaikal, won the preliminary round of the football match.\n\nIf they missed out in sports, the PIMS contingent made a strong showing in the Fine Arts section, bagging the first two spots in sketching. The hosts went one better bagging all the three prizes in painting, nail art and wealth out of waste contests.\n\nIt is not all sports and cultural though with quiz contests to pick brains and an ex-tempore oratory contest where participants have to think on their feet.\n\nIn the Literature and Debate segment, the quizzers from PIMS trumped the competition in the medical quiz with MGMCRI settling for runners up and Jipmer finishing in third spot.\n\nA high point after the solo singing and solo dance in the evening was the live music show by the \u2018Nenjukkulle\u2019 sensation Shakthisree Gopalan and Sathya Prakash, play back singer.\n\nAccording to the organisers, the various events have attracted more than 3,500 footfalls.\n\nAn equally action-packed day awaits participants on the concluding day on Saturday with the final rounds of Futsal, Throw ball, Volley ball, Table tennis and Tattoo art, Eat \u2013 A \u2013 Thon, Fish out of water and Cine Quiz.",
