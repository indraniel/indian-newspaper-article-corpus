    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Farmers\u2019 Association that is not affiliated to any political party has urged the Centre to amend the Seeds Act, 1966.\n\nIn a resolution passed at the monthly meeting recently, the farmers said that officials in charge of checking the quality of seeds sold at shops were unable to do so as shopkeepers escaped inspection citing loopholes in the law.\n\nThe Association said that the law at present exempted inspection of shops that stocked less than 3 kg. The prescription was reasonable as at the time of enactment of the law in 1966, seeds were being sold in kilograms.\n\nBut now that the shops sold seeds in packets of a gram or 10 g, the law should be amended to include for inspection all shops selling seeds.\n\nThis way, even those shops that stocked less than three kg would be brought under the ambit of seed inspection officers, it reasoned.\n\nIt also urged the Centre to enact a law to nullify or reverse the decision of the Supreme Court in the GAIL pipeline case.\n\nCiting the law Parliament passed in the Shah Bano case, it said that the government should table a Bill in Parliament to empower the State Governments to order that the gas pipeline should not be buried on farmers\u2019 lands.\n\nAnd, the government should draft the bill so that it had retrospective effect.\n\nThe Association extended its support to those who staged fast seeking implementation of Avinashi Athikadavu scheme.\n\nThe law at present exempted inspection of shops that stocked less than 3 kg",
