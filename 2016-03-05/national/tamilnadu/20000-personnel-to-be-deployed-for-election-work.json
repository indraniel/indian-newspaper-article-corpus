Veera Raghava Rao, while addressing the media soon after the announcement of election dates on Friday.\n\nMr. Rao said that special security arrangements with the deployment of paramilitary forces would be made in 509 of the 2,685 polling booths in the district which had been identified as vulnerable.\n\nVoter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) would be used on a trial basis in Madurai East constituency alone for which special training would be given to polling personnel, Mr. Rao said.\n\nVVPAT refers to small equipment connected to Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) which, for every vote, will print the name of the candidate chosen by the voter and can be retained for verification.\n\nPointing out that the election Model Code of Conduct (MCC) had come into force with immediate effect, Mr. Rao said that tactical surveillance teams, video surveillance teams, expenditure monitoring teams and round-the-clock flying squads would swing into action to monitor any violations of MCC.
