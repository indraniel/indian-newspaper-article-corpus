    "text": "The City Municipal Corporation is all set to implement its first bio-digester unit at a community toilet in Erumapalayam with community kitchen that will enable the local people to cook food at pollution-free stoves.\n\nMethane gas generated from the public toilet in Ward 44 would be used as a fuel to operate the 10 stoves in the kitchen that would be used by the community people. A bio-digester made of concrete and bricks underneath the toilet would be built that would generate the methane gas which would be released to the cooking stoves in the kitchen, officials said.\n\nUnder the Infrastructure Gap Filling Fund and Operation Maintenance Gap Filling Fund for 2015-16, Rs. 20 lakh would be given while the Corporation would spent Rs. 5 lakh from its general fund for establishing the community kitchen with bio-digester unit. Local community can use the stoves in the kitchen as the methane gas generated would be equal to five LPG cylinders every day. Officials said that the community would be encouraged to utilise the facility as they can save cost on fuel. Also, cooking time in the community kitchen would be much less than normal cooking, they added.\n\nThe officials said that a Kerala-based company had been allotted the project and works were expected to begin soon.",
