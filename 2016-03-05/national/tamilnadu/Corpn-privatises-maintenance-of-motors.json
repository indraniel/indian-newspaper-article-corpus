    "text": "The City Municipal Corporation has handed over the maintenance of submersible motors and air-compressors in the bore wells and open wells in Suramangalam and Hasthampatti Zones at a whopping cost of Rs. 1.16 crore for a year to private companies.\n\nWater supply\n\nThough the Corporation has been supplying protected drinking water to residents through the Mettur \u2013 Salem Dedicated Water Supply Scheme, there are many areas that are yet to be covered. Hence, the existing wells and bore wells are the source of water for the residents in many wards.\n\nDue to shortage of man power, the Corporation was unable to maintain these motors and hence decided to appoint private companies for maintaining it. Hence, it floated tenders last year.\n\nMotors in Ward 1,24,25,26,27 and 26 will be maintained at a cost of Rs. 38.53 lakh while motors in Ward 2,3,18,19,20,21,22 and 23 at a cost of Rs. 38.15 lakh. Also Ward 4,5,6,7,8,12,13,14,15,16,17,29,30 and 31 will be maintained at a cost of Rs. 39.36 lakh. The selected companies should maintain the motors for a year to provide uninterrupted water supply to the residents in each of these wards.\n\nThe civic body had recently passed resolutions accepting the companies to carryout the work.\n\nCost\n\nThe civic body decided to meet out the cost from the drinking water fund for 2015-16. Once Phase II of the water scheme is completed, these areas will be getting continuous water supply.",
