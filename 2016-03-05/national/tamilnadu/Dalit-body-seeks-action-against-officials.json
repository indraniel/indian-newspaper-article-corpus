Karuppaiah, State joint general secretary of the Movement, said that the action was against the government orders and also a High Court order that had forbidden any construction, including renovation, of any temple situated on the government office premises.\n\nHere, the taluk office campus also houses Kangayam Traffic and Law and Order police stations, All Woman police station and sub-treasury office apart from the Tahsildar\u2019s office.\n\nAgainst Centre\u2019s order\n\n\u201cAn order from the Centre, dated about 20 years ago, has even stated that no government office campus should have a temple or any place of worship,\u201d Mr Karuppaiah pointed out.\n\nWork stopped\n\nWhen contacted, Revenue Divisional Officer (Dharapuram) G. Saravanamurthy told The Hindu that the renovation works on the 60-year-old temple were temporarily stopped now following complaints.\n\nHowever, Mr. Karuppaiah was of the stance that action still needed to be taken against the Tahsildar and other revenue officials as they violated the rules to initiate the works.\n\nThey carried out renovation of a temple situated on the Kangayam taluk office campus",
