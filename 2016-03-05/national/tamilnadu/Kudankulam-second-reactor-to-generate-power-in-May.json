Sundar, after handing over garbage cleaning autos to eight village panchayats situated around KKNPP site, said that power generation in the first unit had been gradually increased to 715 MWe and the generation would be increased to 1,000 MWe.\n\nThe second unit would be ready for power generation in May as enriched uranium fuel loading would be taken up in the near future after getting the approval of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, he said.\n\nRelief for power managers\n\nAs Tangedco would get 562 MWe power whenever the first unit of the KKNPP achieved its maximum capacity of 1,000 MWe, the announcement on power generation in the second reactor in May would enthuse power managers considering that the demand would be shooting up in the peak of summer.\n\nMr. Sundar said that excavation of site for the third and the fourth reactors was progressing as planned.",
