    "text": "With 4,100 families that lived along the banks of Adyar having been resettled, the Greater Chennai Corporation has started clearing encroachments to ensure free flow of water through all the spans of bridges across Adyar river. \u201cThe number of spans in the Saidapet bridge that are free of encroachments has increased to 12, from five. Water flow was reported in just three spans of the bridge during the floods,\u201d said a Corporation official.\n\n\u201cAfter the eviction, the width of the Adyar river along MGR Nagar has increased from 45 metres to 80 metres,\u201d the official said. The width of the river in Saidapet has increased from 50 metres to 220 metres. Some of the residents along the Adyar have been unwilling to resettle. After the floods, the civic body identified more than 9,000 houses that have reduced the width of the river.\n\n\u201c We told the residents that they are getting a new house worth Rs. 15 lakh. But we will not force them to resettle. We try to make them understand the impact of the encroachments,\u201d said an official.",
