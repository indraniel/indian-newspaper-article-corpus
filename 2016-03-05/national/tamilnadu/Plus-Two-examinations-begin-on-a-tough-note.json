I was confident of scoring full marks earlier, but now I am doubtful,\u201d said S. Keerthana of DAV Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Gill Nagar.\n\nTense parents were found waiting outside examination centres.\n\n\u201cI took a day\u2019s leave from work. My daughter was worried last night about her French exam and I hope she fares well,\u201d said S. Ramanathan, whose daughter is studying at a school in Ashok Nagar.\n\n\u201cSome parts of the paper were difficult as the questions were culled deep from the syllabus. Students might not have been prepared.
