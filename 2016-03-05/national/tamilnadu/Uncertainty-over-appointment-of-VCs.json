The universities have remained headless for two months and eight months respectively.\n\nLast month, one of the members of the MKU Vice-Chancellor search committee, Prof Mu Ramasamy, had quit, levelling serious allegations against its convener C Murukadas.\n\nSimilarly, a member of the UNOM VC search committee, Surendra Prasad, remained incommunicado following alleged difference of opinion with other members over finalising the shortlist of names for the top post.\n\nIn this backdrop, a cross-section of academics feels that the universities might have to remain headless till a new Government is in place in May.\n\n\u201cState universities have only academic autonomy. The administrative and financial powers vest with the government. Since finance comes largely from the State government and a portion from the Centre, the universities must abide by the norms of the Election Commission,\u201d feels former UNOM Vice Chancellor Prof S P Thyagarajan.\n\nAccording to him, with the mode code of conduct in place it would only be appropriate for the universities to seek special exemption from the Election Commission quoting the necessity for appointing a new Vice-Chancellor. \u201cThe government must justify the request for exemption from the model code of conduct, such as if there is an impending evaluation of the university for accreditation or for (availing any statutory) status,\u201d he explained.\n\nAssociation of University Teachers president M. Ravichandran said since the Governor nominates a person to the search committee with the government\u2019s help, it rests with the government to take up a university\u2019s case.\n\nThere has been at least one instance in the recent past when the Election Commission has given relief to a university.\n\nFormer Vice-Chancellor of Anna University M. Ananadakrishnan recalled that the Rajasthan government had appealed to the Election Commission through the Governor-Chancellor that the Rajasthan University had advertised a large number of faculty vacancies but since the model code of conduct was put in place interviews could not be held. \u201cThe Election Commission gave them a special permission to conduct the recruitment,\u201d Prof. Anandakrishnan recalled.\n\nHowever, he was of the view that since only two more months were left for polling, the Election Commission may not find it appropriate to grant special permission for the appointments.",
