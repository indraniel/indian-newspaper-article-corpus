Singaravelou\n\nThe trial run of the new car of the Sri Lakshmi NarasimhaTemple at Singirikudi in Cuddalore district is scheduled to be held on Sunday.\n\nThis is a prelude to the car festival to be conducted on May 20 (The festival was last celebrated in 2005).\n\nInscriptions\n\nInscriptions in the temple indicate that it was originally built in the 3rd Century AD. Later constructions were added during the Narasimha Pallava II \u2019s reign and Krishna Deva Raya\u2019s visit.\n\nThe temple is being administered by the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE), Tamil Nadu.\n\nAccording to the stalapurana of the temple, king, Nimi Chakravarthy cursed sage Vasishta to lose his identity and wander in the atmosphere without a body. On the advice of Brahma, the sage proceeded to Singirikudi and performed tapas propitiating Narasimha.\n\nThe sage thus attained salvation through severe penance and the Gods gave him darshan.\n\nThis place is called Singarkudi with the presiding deity being Singaperumal or Narasimha (with 16 hands). The Lord\u2019s birth star Swathi is celebrated on a grand scale.\n\nCar in disuse since 2005\n\nA HR &CE official said the temple car was in disuse since 2005. Work on the new car began in the year 2009 at an estimated cost of Rs. 60 lakhs.\n\nThe artisans are busy giving touches to the wooden structure. It is being embellished with bright colours and fitted with bells.\n\nElaborate arrangements are being made for the trial run to be held on Sunday.",
