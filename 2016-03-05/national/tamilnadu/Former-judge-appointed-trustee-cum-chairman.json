Lee Chengalvaraya Naicker Trust till September 19, 2017.\n\nThe post fell vacant following the resignation of Justice A.K. Rajan alleging harassment and ill-treatment by other trustees. Subsequently, the court appointed Administrator General and the Official Trustee of Tamil Nadu as temporary chairman.

The court then gave liberty to the petitioners to suggest names of former judges of the court, on whom they havetrust and faith, to discharge the duties of the trustee-cum-chairman.\n\nWhen the plea came up for hearing on Wednesday, a Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and S. Vaidyanathan, while making the new appointment said, \u201cThis court, at this juncture would like to point out that the trustees are serving a charitable cause to further the object of the public charitable trust created by a philanthropist P.T. Lee Chengalvaraya Naicker. They are bound to conduct themselves in a manner befitting their stature as a trustee and enhance the reputation of the trust.\u201d",
