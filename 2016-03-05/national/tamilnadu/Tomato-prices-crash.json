The demand-supply dynamics has been causing misery to the cultivators for a month now.\n\nThe price has been fluctuating between Rs. 10 and Rs. 5. According to tomato traders, several farmers have left the tomato crop on their fields to wither or let cattle graze on the produce due to the unremunerative price.\n\nA daily wage of Rs. 400 has to be paid to a farm worker and the transport costs in addition would otherwise cause heavier loss to the cultivators, a trader said.\n\nHorticulture Department officials say the price fluctuation for perishables was not unusual.\n\nIn the case of tomato, the average cost of cultivation is Rs. 25,000 an acre, and the productivity ranges from 10 tonnes to 12 tonnes an acre. Farmers could evade loss if the price of tomato is in the range of Rs. 10 per kg, but below that level, the loss is bound to be heavy, official sources said.\n\nSince the price is Rs. 5 at the retail point, the field rate would not exceed Rs. 3 a kg, thereby pushing the cultivators to distress situation of letting cattle graze on the field rather than spend on harvesting, the sources said, adding that there is no solution in sight since even if the scope processing tomato is explored, the culture of consuming packaged tomato is not prevalent.",
