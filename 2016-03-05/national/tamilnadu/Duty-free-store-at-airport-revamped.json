    "text": "International passengers at the Chennai airport can expect a new shopping experience at the duty-free Shop, as it is expected to soon start selling an extensive selection of brands and products at prices that match or better those at duty free shops at airports in Singapore or Dubai.\n\nFlemingo, the Dubai-based duty free retailer who runs the store, is doubling the space of the store and bringing world class ambience and wider product range into the store. The revamped Flemingo Duty Free is expected to be opened over the next 2-3 months.\n\n\u201cWe found that Chennaiites feel that products at overseas airports are cheaper. And also, that products in Chennai Duty Free may not be authentic. Both are completely wrong notions. Everything is handled through proper channel before they get to the Duty Free Shops,\u201d Anirban Dutta Chowdhury, Chief Executive Officer of Flemingo Dutyfree Shop Pvt Ltd told The Hindu.",
