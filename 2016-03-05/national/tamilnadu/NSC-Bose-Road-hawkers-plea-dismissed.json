    "text": "The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed the review plea moved by an association representing the hawkers on the NSC Bose Road.\n\nThe high court through an order dated October 13, 2015 directed the Commissioner of Chennai Corporation and the Additional Commissioner of Police, Chennai City Traffic to take necessary action on a plea to ensure that the area is cleared of all encroachments and is maintained as no-hawking zone.\n\nAssailing the order, Singaravelar Olympic Muthal Broadway Corner Varai Salaiyora Siru Kadai Vyaparigal Nala Sangam, moved a petition to review the order.\n\nWhen the review plea came up for hearing , petitioner\u2019s advocate D. Nagasaila, contended that the order has been passed without taking into consideration the earlier directions of the court directing the authorities to refer the cases to the hawking Zone Committee.\n\nOpposing the contentions, the Additional Advocate General P.H. Aravind Pandian relying on an order passed by a Division Bench argued that all the hawkers on the road were enumerated and they have been given alternative space for carrying on their activities.",
