    "text": "Ahead of the release of results of the semester exams held in November/December 2015, Anna University has created a smart phone app to access the results by keying in the candidates\u2019 registration number and date of birth.\n\n\u201cWe tried the app route for students as they complained that even two days after uploading the results on the website they were unable to view it. The app would enable the candidates to access the results as soon as they are released,\u201d said G. Uma, Controller of Examinations. According to her, an app was created last semester and the response to it was encouraging and hence they chose to continue with it.\n\nProf. Uma said the results would be declared on Saturday.\n\nThe semester exams for which the results are being declared on Saturday was fraught with uncertainties with students from the four flood-affected districts \u2013 Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore - demanding that the exams be postponed by at least a month or that they be allowed to take the exams the next semester.",
