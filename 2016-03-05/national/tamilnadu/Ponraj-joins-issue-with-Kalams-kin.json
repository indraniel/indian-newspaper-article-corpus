In case they want me to take the lead, I am willing to do so\u2026the ultimate goal is only to realise the vision of Abdul Kalam,\u201d he contended.\n\nMeanwhile, the AVIP and Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam, an outfit headed by Tamilaruvi Manian, who has had stints in various parties since the 1960s and has in the past backed different parties, formed the \u2018Alternative Political Front\u2019.\n\nThe AVIP\u2019s website www.abdulkalamvip.org was also launched.",
