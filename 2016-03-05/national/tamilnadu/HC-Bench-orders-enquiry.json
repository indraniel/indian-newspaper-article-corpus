A Division Bench of Justices A. Selvam and V.S. Ravi directed the District Judge to conduct an enquiry and submit a report to the court by March 15.\n\nThe order was passed after A. Kumaresan, Additonal Superintendent of Prison, filed a counter affidavit denying the allegation of having kept the petitioner\u2019s husband in solitary confinement.",
