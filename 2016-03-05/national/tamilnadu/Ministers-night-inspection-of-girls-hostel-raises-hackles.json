    "text": "A video that went viral on Friday showing a Minister inspecting a girls\u2019 hostel at night and making unsavoury comments, even touching their tee shirts, stirred up a controversy.\n\nMinister for Sports and Youth Welfare S. Sundararaj conducted an inspection of the District Sports Hostel in Pudukottai, which housed girls (as in the video) too, strangely at night.\n\nHe is seen being rude and dismissive of the girls, besides asking inappropriate questions to them. In one scene he can also be seen poking a girl at her waist, as he asks her about her tee shirt.\n\nHe also asks a girl what game she played, and when she replies that it was hockey, he rudely mocks her, saying she did not look like one. He goes on to tell her that she has put on weight and asks whether her mother knows about it. After the perplexed girl replies that only her father knows, Mr. Sundararaj asks whether her mother doesn\u2019t live with her father. When another girl tells him that her father was no more, he goes on to ask whether her father was dead or was \u201ctravelling.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Mr.Sundararaj told The Hindu that he had no malafide intentions; he had visited the hostel in Pudukottai after he had gone to the district to congratulate an athlete who had won medals at the recent South Asian Games. He maintained that he visited the hostel and enquired the well being of the hostel inmates and about their performance. \u201cI only put some questions sociably. I wanted the girls to come up well and Tamil Nadu to get medals at the international level.\u201d\n\nBe that as it may, the manner and timing of his visit and his conversation made it clear that at no point was it \u2018sociable\u2019.",
