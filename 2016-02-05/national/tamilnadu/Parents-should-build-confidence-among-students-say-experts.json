    "text": "Ahead of the public examinations for SSLC and Plus Two candidates, schools in the district are apparently ensuring that students are in an ideal frame of mind, through counseling sessions .\n\nThe school education department, also organised counseling sessions for students of government schools with the help of Erode Sengunthar Engineering College at Thudupathi and a few other institutions in Chennimalai and Gobichettipalayam. Students are now poised and well- prepared for the practical exam slated for the first week of next month, Chief Educational Officer P. Ayyannan said. Likewise, private schools have also invited professional counsellors who have helped students realise their potential. According to the counselors, parents can do a lot more to reassure students before examinations. They should not communicate their anxiety to their wards; it would make the children more nervous, said A. Mohitheen Batcha, Managing Director, Catharsis Emotional Wellness Services Pvt. Ltd., Chennai. Parents also ought to set realistic targets for achievement, and use positive strokes for propelling performance. Unusually high expectation is bound to hamper even usual performance.\n\nIt is important for parents to reassure their children that they stand behind them no matter what their score. It is this kind of reaffirmation that will stand the students in good stead and help them deliver their best, Mr. Batcha explained.",
