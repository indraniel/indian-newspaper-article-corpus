Shanta called for standard protocols for screening and treatment across the State.\n\nSpeaking at the institute on Wednesday, Dr. Shanta said that there were many centres in the State that had their own ways of screening and treating patients.\n\n\u201cAll of this should be done under one standard protocol and the data collated. We want to be the leaders in this. Only then can screening programmes and treatment cover all rural areas,\u201d she said. Earlier, she had pointed out that facilities for diagnosis and treatment were concentrated in the urban areas. \u201cCovering only urban areas is not ethical and not social justice,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Shanta also stressed the importance of tobacco control: \u201cWhen there is no control on tobacco, cancer cannot be controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also spoke about the importance of palliative care, saying that a lot needed to be done in this field and adding that this was an important component of cancer control.\n\n\u201cCancer control starts with prevention and then goes on from early detection to rehabilitation,\u201d said Hemanth Raj, vice-chairman of the institute. By June or so, the institute will also launch a bus, which will function as a mobile exhibition and go around various towns and villages with information, including videos, for the public on cancer, said Dr. Raj.",
