    "text": "Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA) held a gate meeting in Tiruvannamalai Government Arts College here on Thursday opposing relocation of 375 Annamalai University teachers to government arts colleges.\n\nSpeaking in the meeting G. Elango, Vellore Zonal President of TNGCTA said the teachers whom the government is relocating were appointed by the Annamalai University without following the norms of the UGC. Hence their relocation to government colleges all over the state would affect the higher education system in the state.\n\nDr. Elango told The Hindu that similar gate meetings were held in all five arts colleges in the region and he said that TNGCTA condemns these relocations.",
