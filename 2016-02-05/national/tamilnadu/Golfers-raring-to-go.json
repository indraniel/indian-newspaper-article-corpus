Devarajulu, a doyen of Indian industry and former chairman and managing director of Lakshmi Machine Works Ltd.\n\nMr. Devarajulu was one who had always supported sports, specially golf. So it is definitely nice to see a championship of this magnitude being played in his memory. And, LMW is pleased as well to sponsor the event every year.\n\nInto the 17th year, the two-day event will be played over this weekend. It is a team event where four golfers make a team. The best three cards of the team and their medal play score is determined to decide the top two finishers.\n\nThe roaring winds normally pose a huge challenge for the golfers, be it a professional or an amateur. But, this time around it has died down a bit. However, it is not going to be an easy course to travel as the pin positions are expected to be tough and strategically placed.\n\nAbout 20 teams have confirmed participation and a few more are expected to join the list on the big day. Most of these teams have already started training seriously to get some good scores on their cards.\n\nAnd, it may well turn the tables in their favour on the big day.",
