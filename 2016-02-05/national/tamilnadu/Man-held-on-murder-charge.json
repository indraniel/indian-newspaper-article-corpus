    "text": "The death of an 80-year-old woman near Thudiyalur about a week ago that was suspected to be an accidental fall into water tank has turned out to be a murder. The Thudiyalur police on Thursday arrested Sakthivel (28) from Gudiyatham in Vellore district for allegedly murdering Visalakshi.\n\nThe police said that the woman lived in Rangammal Colony near Thudiyalur with her son Manoharan and grandson Rajesh Kumar (34), a painting contractor. Sakthivel was one of the employees working for Rajesh Kumar and was at work at a private college in Saravanampatti.\n\nLast week, Sakthivel went to Rajesh Kumar\u2019s house and asked for some money. Rajesh had told him that he would give the money in a couple of days. Sakthivel then asked permission to spend the night in front of Rajesh\u2019s house as it was late in the evening and he would not be able to reach Saravanampatti.\n\nLater that night, Visalakshi went out of the house to attend nature\u2019s call, when the accused tried to snatch her gold chain. He strangulated her when she tried to cry for help, and dumped her body in the ground level water tank in front of the house. He then slept in front of the house and left the next morning. Later, the woman\u2019s family found her body in the tank.\n\nSuspecting that she could have accidentally fallen in to the tank and died, the police registered the case under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedures. Visalakshi\u2019s body was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination, the report of which revealed that she was murdered. The police altered the case to Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and after inquiries arrested Sakthivel.",
