The works would be executed through donor and the HR and CE would contribute its part, an official of HR and CE told The Hindu at the temple on Thursday. The temple was last renovated in February 3, 2006 at an expenditure of Rs.50 lakh.\n\nA preliminary estimate for renovation of temple is being prepared and a final report would be arrived at in course of time, the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, the HR and CE, utilising its own funds, had given a facelift to the old buildings belonging to the temple and located at various places in front of the temple.\n\n\u201cMore important among the utilisation plan was giving a facelift to the old building constructed in 1969 and which was in disuse,\u201d said K. Karthiresan, Executive Officer of the temple.\n\nThe old building which housed a Siddha unit on the first floor and eight cottages (yatri nivas) for the devotees was not only in disuse but also located among unhygienic environment due to open defecation.\n\n\u201cWe fenced the entire area and prevented the entry of trespassers into the building. We had given a total facelift to the structure. While the first floor is being used as \u2018Annadhana koodam\u2019 with a seating capacity for 100 devotees a day, the eight cottages on the ground floor have also been put to use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HR and CE has renovated two marriage halls near the temple. A toilet block and \u2018mudi mandapam\u2019 have been maintained. \u201cA large number of devotees who visit the temple are often surprised over the maintenance work and maximum utilisation of the available buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe temple tank has been cleared of its silt and sports a new look.\n\nWith a good part of these works having been completed, the HR and CE plans to renovate the temple, he added.",
