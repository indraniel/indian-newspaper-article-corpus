Hence, there is a need for dedicated anaesthetists. The conference served as a platform to share experiences and knowledge. Workshops, sessions and poster presentations were part of the conference that was attended by 300 delegates and 50 faculty members. International faculty from Singapore, Australia, Italy and USA also took part.\n\nThe academic session started with the pre-conference workshop and was followed by two days of sessions for the anaesthetic care of children, the release said.\n\n- Staff Reporter",
