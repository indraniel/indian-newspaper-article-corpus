He said that he came across 13 cases of such abandoned people since December.\n\nVolunteers said that unlike \u20181098\u2019 Childline helpline number, there was no dedicated working helpline for elderly people. \u201cVolunteers have to call either Social Welfare Department officials or the RCS. But public are not aware of their phone numbers,\u201d said G. Edison, Founder and Managing Trustee of Hands of Compassion Home in Alagarkoil.\n\nHe said that the situation was worse in the case of abandoned people who were ill. \u201cSometimes, bystanders call\u2018108\u2019 ambulance and send them to government hospital. However, the rescued person receives scant attention after that. Many a time, we had gone through great trouble in getting the person shifted to a home,\u201d Mr. Edison said.\n\nP. Ramar, Managing Trustee of Mother Teresa Trust, which is managing the Corporation Home for Urban Homeless Poor, said that volunteers also had to tackle procedural issues. \u201cEven if a volunteer wants to help in admitting an elderly person to a home, he is asked to take the responsibility for cremation, if the person dies.\u201d\n\nMr. Ramar said that though the RCS should ideally take the responsibility of rescuing elderly persons, rarely any support was received from it. RCS volunteers were not available for comment when contacted by The Hindu .\n\nDistrict Social Welfare Officer R. Anandavalli, however, denied the allegations that the RCS was not responding on time. She, however, acknowledged that there were issues with rescuing elderly persons with illness as only homes for elderly women and an integrated home for women and children were available in Thenur and Palamedu respectively. \u201cBut we are doing everything we could to accommodate the ill in private homes,\u201d she said.",
