    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday quashed as many as 49 private complaints lodged by election officials in Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Karur and Ramanathapuram against the district secretaries of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam as well as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on charges of attempting to include bogus voters in the electoral lists in 2005.\n\nThe petitioners had been accused of submitting applications in bulk along with recommendation letters for inclusion in the voters\u2019 lists. However, on verification, the officials found most of the applications to be either fake or filed in the names of minors. Assailing the correctness of criminal prosecution launched against them, the petitioners claimed they could not be held responsible for applications filed by others.",
