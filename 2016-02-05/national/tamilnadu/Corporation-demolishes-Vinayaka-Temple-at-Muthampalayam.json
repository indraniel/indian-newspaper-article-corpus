GOVARTHAN\n\nThe City Corporation on Thursday demolished the Vinayaka Temple at Muthamlalayam, in compliance with a court order.\n\nThe action was delayed for over six months as most of the residents of Muthampalayam Housing Colony Phase I resisted the Corporation's move. Since the local body had a deadline to execute the order, it carried out the demolition with police protection. The action followed issuance of notices. The temple\u2019s presence in the locality became a legal complication after a resident moved the court saying the construction had been carried out at a spot earmarked for Park.",
