Gopalakrishnan\n\nThe high-level bridge constructed across Buckingham Canal to connect Nemmeli on East Coast Road (ECR) with Tiruporur on Rajiv Gandhi Salai (Old Mahabalipuram Road) is yet to serve its purpose.\n\nThe bridge, which was completed last year after a series of delays, is still without certain safety measures, alleged Narayanan, a resident of Tiruporur.\n\nHe said that lack of protective railings on the ramps leading to the bridge from both sides and a poor approach road on the Nemmeli side made using the bridge difficult for the motorists, particularly motorcyclists, especially when they negotiated the stretch at night.\n\nEnquiries reveal that the project of constructing the bridge was taken up way back in 2010 at an estimated cost of Rs.4.10 crore under the tsunami rehabilitation programme and it moved at a snail\u2019s pace until 2012.\n\nWhen the project was revived in 2013 by the Highways Department with a firm commitment to completing it by March 2014, the cost was revised to Rs. 6 crore.\n\nThen, after further delays, the project was completed in 2015.\n\nThe bridge has been designed in such a manner that it stood about 5.5 metres above the high-tide level of the Buckingham canal, said sources.",
