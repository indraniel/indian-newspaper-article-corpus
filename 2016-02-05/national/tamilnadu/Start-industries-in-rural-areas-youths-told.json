Karthikeyan\n\nYouths should start industries in rural areas utilising locally available raw materials to scale down production costs and improve rural economy, said Collector T.N. Hariharan.\n\nAddressing an awareness expo on entrepreneurial opportunities for SC/ST youths held at the Collectorate here on Thursday, he said that District Industries Centre (DIC) had been arranging bank loans up to Rs. 1 crore without any collateral security to young entrepreneurs to start industries or businesses.\n\nTwenty five per cent of the loan amount would be given as subsidy along with three per cent interest grant to young entrepreneurs. Already, two Adi Dravida youths had availed themselves of Rs. 1 crore with the help of the DIC for setting up of power loom.\n\nThe DIC had released a subsidy of Rs. 70.72 lakh to 41 entrepreneurs under New Entrepreneur-cum-Enterprise Development Scheme (NEEDS) and Rs. 1.43 crore to 170 entrepreneurs under TAHDCO Scheme so far in this financial year. The main objective of the expo was to create awareness among youths of the entrepreneurial opportunities created by the government, he noted.\n\nThe Collector appealed to Adi Dravida youths to avail themselves of the opportunities to start rural industries.\n\nSeveral representatives of Dalit groups appealed to the government to introduce reservation for Dalits in sanctioning industrial loans. They also demanded simplification of loan procedures and speedy processing of loan applications.",
