    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) president Vijayakant in a case booked against him and his party men for allegedly damaging an AIADMK hoarding erected near Thanjavur bus stand on December 28.\n\nJustice P.N. Prakash directed Mr. Vijayakant to execute a bond for Rs.10,000 along with two sureties for an equal sum to the satisfaction of a Judicial Magistrate in Thanjavur for claiming the benefit of advance bail. Earlier, he asked State Public Prosecutor S. Shanmugavelayutham not to be too rigid in opposing advance bail plea in cases arising out of political disputes.\n\n\u201cI know it hurts you. But in politics, you have to have a very broad outlook. I appreciate that the politicians of this country believe in ballot and not bullet. We are a true democracy, not fake democracy. And I am sure your leadership does not live on the strength of cut outs and hoardings. These are issues blown up by followers at the lower level,\u201d the judge told the SPP.\n\nHe accepted the submission of Senior Counsel M. Ajmal Khan, appearing for Mr. Vijayakant, to exempt his client from depositing Rs.45,000, the quantum of damages caused to the hoarding, as a pre-condition for advance bail since he was the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly. Instead, the judge directed other party men, who had also sought for anticipatory bail, to deposit the amount.\n\nHe also granted bail to eight DMDK men who had been arrested immediately after the incident. The Thanjavur East Police had booked the accused under Sections 143, 147, and 547 of the IPC apart from Section 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act, 1992 on a complaint by AIADMK MLA M. Rengasamy.",
