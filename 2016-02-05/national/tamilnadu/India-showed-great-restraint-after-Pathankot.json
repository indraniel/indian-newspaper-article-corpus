    "text": "A US defence policy expert has opined that it was mature on the part of India to have shown restraint from being provoked during the aftermath of the terror attacks on an air force base at Pathankot in Punjab.\n\nInteracting with journalists at the US Consulate General here, Mark A. Bucknam, Professor, National Security Strategy in National War College in Washington DC, said the incident inside an air force base was \u201cvery troubling\u201d.\n\nLauding India for not allowing itself to be played into the hands of forces that intended to disturb efforts in the peace-making process, Mr. Bucknam said India had maintained \u201cgreat show of restraint.\u201d\n\nClarifying that his opinion did not represent the stand of the US government or National War College, Mr. Bucknam, who had spent nearly four years at the Pentagon, replied in the negative when asked whether hot pursuit in this case was an option.\n\nWhile commenting on including Japan as a permanent partner in the \u2018Malabar\u2019 naval exercises involving India and the US since October last year, he said the decision would help Washington DC in coordinating with multiple partners at a time during emergency situations.\n\nChina\u2019s tough stand\n\nWhen asked for his opinion over China\u2019s tough stand on navigation in the South China Sea, he said the US wanted stability in the region.\n\n\u201cThe US is not trying to contain China. The US cannot contain China. The US is only interested in the peaceful rise of China.\u201d\n\nHowever, it maintained its stand over freedom of navigation on the high seas, including the South China Sea, he said.\n\nSays hot pursuit in this case was not an option",
