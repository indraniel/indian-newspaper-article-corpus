    "text": "A plea moved by an advocate in the Madras High Court challenging three Government Orders (GO) passed by the State government that mandated that the investigating agency take prior approval from the Chief Secretary while probing corruption charges against All-India Service officers and a subsequent Supreme Court verdict scrapping a similar provision in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act were behind the government\u2019s move to withdraw the extant G.O.s dated December 20, 1988 .\n\nFor the sake of uniformity in processing corruption allegations against all government servants, in the light of the apex court order, the government passed the latest G.O. In a recent hearing, the court adjourned the petition moved by advocate P. Pugalenthi to February 5 for reporting compliance by the government, and the authorities are likely to submit the new G.O. before the court on Friday.\n\nWhat the SC said\n\nOn May 6, 2014, while declaring Section 6-A of the Act violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, a five-judge Bench said: \u201cThe status or position of a public servant does not qualify the person from exemption from equal treatment. The decision making power does not segregate corrupt officers into two classes as they are common crime doers and have to be tracked down by the same process of inquiry and investigation.\u201d",
