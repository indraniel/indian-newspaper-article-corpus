    "text": "Aarthy (name changed), a Plus Two student of a private school, fainted just before a mid-term biology examination. The school authorities rushed her to a hospital and informed her parents. This happened a couple of times more before her teachers spoke to her about it and learnt that Aarthy had an inordinate fear of biology but had opted for the subject only to please her parents. It took counselling before she felt less nervous about the forthcoming Plus Two examinations.\n\nThis is one of the many causes of stress in students who face public examination undergo, says psychologist and counsellor S. Karthikeyan.There is performance anxiety where students are under tremendous pressure to meet impossibly high expectations of parents.\n\nAs if this is not enough, many schools divide the class into \u2018above average\u2019 and \u2018average\u2019 sections. There is constant anxiety in the student that he or she may be put into the \u2018average\u2019 category.\n\nThese anxieties have physical repercussions with students suffering from indigestion, sleeplessness, an inability to concentrate, irritability, etc., says counsellor Hemalatha Venkataraman.\n\nOne way of beating the stress is to plan and stick to a schedule from the start of the academic year, says Rajini Krishnamurthy, Secretary, Vidhya Niketan Public School.\n\nThe other way to ensure a healthy state of mind and body before the exam is to get a good eight-hour sleep as brain needs to recoup and relax, urges Mr. Karthikeyan. And ensure there is a healthy routine, says Ms Venkataraman.",
