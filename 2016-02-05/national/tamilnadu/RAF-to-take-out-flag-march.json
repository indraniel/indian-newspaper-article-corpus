They have planned to cover other communally sensitive and hyper-sensitive areas in Theni, Andipatti, Bodi and Uthamapalayam sub-divisions in the days to come. They will be camping in the district till February 9.\n\nThe RAF personnel had been covering all districts in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka periodically. They covered all the districts in a State once in two years, said Assistant Commandant of RAF K. Venkatesan.\n\nThe RAF would observe the topography of sensitive areas, and assess causes and intensity of violence in the identified areas. The RAF personnel would also visit police stations to check the number of incidents of communal violence that took place within their jurisdictions. They would create a map of sensitive areas and write down all details of the area to enable the force to take swift action in case of emergency. As part of their social service activities, the RAF personnel planted tree saplings at a government school in Silvarpatti in Periyakulam block on Thursday morning and interacted with schoolchildren and teachers.\n\nThe RAF personnel would consolidate the data on communal violence and other related clashes, and submit a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The RAF team visited the district in 2010 for similar familiarisation exercise.",
