The port is coming up on three acres out of the roughly 20 acres acquired on the seafront by the Coast Guard to develop its sea assets.\n\nThe Coast Guard had not been able to use the land after the Government focused its 2004 post-tsunami rehabilitation projects for the coastal population in this area. Last month, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy had taken the initiative to release 3.45 acres of land at Veerampattinam for the Coast Guard to develop its hoverport project.\n\nOn Thursday, scores of villagers took out a procession with black flags. They were blocked by police when they attempted to proceed towards the site. The protestors raised slogans against the Union Territory and Central governments demanding dropping of the proposal.\n\nPolice prevented a woman who attempted to commit self-immolation.\n\nS. Sundari, former councillor said, \u201cThe setting up of a hoverport would hamper our free movement and fishing activities.\u201d\n\nCadres of Periyar Viduthalai Kazhagam, led by Logu Aiyyappan, joined the protest. Mr. Aiyyappan alleged that the authorities have been attempting to crush the protest.",
