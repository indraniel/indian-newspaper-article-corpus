After trial, the special court for motor vehicle accident cases pronounced a judgment in December 2013 in which it directed the TNSTC to pay Rs.4.34 lakh as compensation to the victim\u2019s family. As the corporation has not paid the amount, court ordered the corporation to pay the compensation with interest. As the corporation failed to pay that amount even after that, victim\u2019s family filed execution petition and the court ordered to attach a TNSTC bus on January 19 this year. To implement the order, court staffs attached a bus plying in Tiruvannamalai-Bangalore route.",
