    "text": "Academics representing various non-governmental organisations on Thursday charged that the government is circumventing the rules and Act governing private matriculation schools.\n\nRepresentatives of the NGOs said the School Education Department had issued two orders to recognise the institutions though they had flouted the Rules of Right to Education Act. Section 18 and 19 of the Act is clear that for a school to be recognised it should fulfil the norms and standards specified in the schedule, including the size of the building. The managements of all matriculation schools were given time to comply with the norms regarding minimum land area and norms laid down by the National Building Code.\n\nWhen the Act came into force, the violating schools were given five years to comply with the norms in the interest of the existing students.\n\nThe moratorium ended in 2015. But in August last, the schools received another reprieve till May 2016 through an order issued by the government.",
