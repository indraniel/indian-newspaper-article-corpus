    "text": "The incident of three class VIII students of the Kendra Vidyalaya at Indian Institute of Technology\u2013Madras, leaving on a leisure trip to Goa through Bengaluru on a bus points to a failure of the government mechanism meant for the protection of children.\n\nThe students stole over Rs. 50,000 from their parents and left home on Monday. The anxious parents lodged a complaint with the Kotturpuram police at night. The police registered a case and sub-inspector K. Pushparani started an investigation.\n\n\u201cI found that the boys were very intelligent and their friends told me that they had wanted to travel to Goa and have fun. They had travelled to different destinations during their NCC camp and it had kindled an interest in travelling,\u201d she told The Hindu.\n\nThe three managed to find the route with the help of the internet and mobile applications.\n\n\u201cThey took a bus to Bengaluru from Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) and they travelled in a private bus from Bengaluru to Goa,\u201d she said.\n\nThey returned to Chennai on Wednesday. \u201cI spoke to them and found that they had a deep interest in travelling. After it was suspected that the children had gone to Goa, I instructed the parents not to scold them when they returned, but take a week\u2019s leave and take them on a vacation to the spots where they wanted to go,\u201d added Pushparani.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nHowever, the matter is far from settled. Some questions remain, which include \u2018How did the staff of the bus to Bengaluru or the police men at CMBT fail to notice that four children were travelling alone?\u2019\n\n\u201cThis shows the failure of the system,\u201d said a retired police officer.\n\nMeanwhile, Child Line officials said that they provide training to bus drivers, conductors and policemen on identifying runaway children and rescuing them.\n\n\u201cBut the personnel keep changing. However, very rarely do runaway children go undetected as our volunteers are there at railway stations and bus stands. We have rescued many children,\u201d said an official.\n\nExperts say the incident points to flaws in mechanism meant for protecting children",
