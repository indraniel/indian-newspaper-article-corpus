    "text": "In a significant order, the Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday directed Dindigul Collector and Municipality to accept an application filed by a transgender for the post of noon meal organiser (NMO) reserved for women candidates.\n\nJustice Pushpa Sathyanarayana passed the order while disposing of a writ petition filed by Monal who claimed not to have been issued with a call letter for the interview sessions scheduled for February 5 and 8 despite making an application for the post on time.\n\nObserving that induction of transgenders in government service would go a long way in uplifting their social status, the judge hoped that the petitioner, after getting appointed to the post, would serve with dedication and commitment besides advancing the cause of transgenders.\n\nThe judge also recalled that the First Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and herself had passed an order recently in the Principal Seat of the High Court in Chennai directing Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board to appoint a transgender as Sub-Inspector of Police.",
