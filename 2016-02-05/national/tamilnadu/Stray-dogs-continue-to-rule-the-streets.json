    "text": "Due to the slow pace of implementation of the animal birth control programme for stray dogs in the city, their population has doubled in the last five years posing a threat to citizens.\n\nThese dogs that were earlier found in large numbers near meat stalls, garbage dumps, and in residential areas.\n\nNowadays they are seen across the city and in public places in large numbers.\n\nAfter the programme was implemented by the corporation in 2007, less than 1,500 dogs were so far sterilised.\n\nThe population of stray dogs in the city had grown from about 7,500 to 18,000, according to a conservative estimate.\n\nThough a new post care surgery unit was constructed at Veeranam compost yard, less than 15 dogs were sterilised there every week.\n\nThe NGO that undertakes the programme was paid Rs. 490 for performing the surgery and maintaining the dog for three days after the surgery.\n\nCitizens wanted the programme to be expedited by increasing the number of doctors, and extending the facilities at the post operative centre.",
