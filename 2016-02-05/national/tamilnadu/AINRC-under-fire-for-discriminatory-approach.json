Namassivayam said that constituencies held by the Congress were ignored totally. They were totally kept out of the schemes for months together while in other constituencies the scheme was being implemented at a fast pace.\n\nMr. Namassivayam said that the distribution of free mixies and grinders was yet to reach cardholders in Kamaraj Nagar and Villianur held by the Congress.\n\nThe government owned undertakings were ignored and no steps were taken to salvage the situation while the administration was facilitating backdoor appointments increasing the debt burden, he said.\n\nFelicitation function\n\nThe Congress will organise a felicitation function on February 12 here to honour party MLA E. Valsaraj representing Mahe, an enclave of the Union Territory in Kerala who has completed 25 years in the Assembly.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad will be the chief guest at the function. Mr. Valsaraj was first elected from Mahe constituency in 1990 and was a Minister during the previous Congress regime.",
