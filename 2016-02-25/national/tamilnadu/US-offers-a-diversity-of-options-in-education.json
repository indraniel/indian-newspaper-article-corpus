Raghunathan\n\nThe number of students travelling from India to study in the United States increased by 30 per cent in the last year, Philip Min, U.S. Consul General in Chennai, said on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Min said India was second only to China in terms of the number of overseas students studying in the United States. \u201c132,000 students came to our country last year. This is the highest since we started keeping track a few years ago,\u201d he added. Mr. Min was speaking to the media during a presentation by EducationUSA, a global network supported by the U.S Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\n\nThe network has seen thousands of Indian students approaching the centre for advice, he said. \u201cLast year 1,20,000 students contacted the centre while considering travelling to the United States for education. I get a lot of questions on why youth should choose the United States for education. To that, I say there is a diversity of options, be it vocational schools or culinary institutes,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked about the Indian students who were turned back from entering the country, he clarified they were not deported but only denied entry for some reason. \u201cBut this issue, in my opinion, will not affect the number of students coming to the country to study,\u201d he said.",
