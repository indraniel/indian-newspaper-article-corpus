Krishnan, employed at a private concern.\n\nHe questioned the delay in re-laying the road and said even patch works were not done to facilitate smooth flow of vehicles.\n\nThe presence of speed breakers, laid without following norms, and the pits near the speed breakers pose threat to the road users everyday.\n\nHowever, the concerned authorities are taking no steps either to relay it or carry patch work. \u2018It seems only if major mishap happens, authorities will carry out the works\u2019, said a senior citizen.",
