However, roads were not re-laid after completion of the works as road-users had to encounter pothole-ridden roads and pits causing hardship.\n\nProtests\n\nVarious protests were held condemning the corporation\u2019s failure to relay the roads in the past five years. With election date expected to be announced next week, the corporation received Rs. 7,447.06 lakh for 293 road works that would be executed as 41 packages.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayor S. Soundappan laid the foundation at Rajaram Nagar in Hasthampatti Zone in the presence Commissioner K.R. Selvaraj, MLAs M.K. Selvaraj and G. Venkatachalam, Deputy Mayor M. Natesan, Executive Engineers and others.\n\nRoads would be re-laid for 27.556 km at a cost of Rs. 1,753.67 lakh in Suramangalam Zone, for 29.102 km at a cost of Rs. 1,820.15 lakh in Hasthampatti Zone, for 26.645 km at Rs. 1,810.85 km in Ammapet Zone and for 38.702 km at Rs. 2,062.39 lakh in Kondalampatti Zone.\n\nOfficials said that works are divided into 41 packages and hence re-laying would be carried out simultaneously in all the areas. By completing the works, all the roads would be new in the corporation limits, they added.",
