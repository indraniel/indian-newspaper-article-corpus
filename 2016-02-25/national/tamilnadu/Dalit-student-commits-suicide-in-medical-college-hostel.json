Parithi Semmal, a Dalit student from Tiruchi, committed suicide by hanging from a fan in his hostel room between 5.30 a.m. and 6.30 a.m. Parithi Semmal, who is described as a bright student, was seen moving with other students around 5 a.m.\n\nWhen his hostel mates knocked at his door around 6.30 a.m., it was locked from inside and there was no response. When they saw him hanging from the ceiling fan, the students broke open the door and brought him down. Their attempts to revive him proved futile. College sources said that the deceased student had already completed three theory examinations and was preparing for a practical examination on Wednesday.\n\nSome of his friends are said to have told the police during investigation that Parithi was taking medicines to overcome depression. The body of the student was shifted to Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital (KGMCH) for post-mortem.\n\nHis father, Balakrishnan, an employee of the Department of Agriculture, refused to talk to the press on Wednesday evening at the KGMCH at Asaripallam in Nagercoil. Kulasekaram police have registered a case under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
