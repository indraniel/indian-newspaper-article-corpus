Rajkumar said.\n\nConsumption of the shells of the animal, included in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, is believed to enhance lactating mothers to secrete more milk. The scales of ant-eaters made of keratin are valued internationally, particularly in China, for use as ornaments as well\n\nIn India, Traffc India - a division of WWF India, has been in the forefront of creating awareness on saving pangolins from extinction, unfailingly on the World Pangolin Day on February 20. According to the wildlife body, the threat of extinction of the scaly ant-eaters is all the more acute since there is no information available on their population status and the current level of illegal utilisation.",
