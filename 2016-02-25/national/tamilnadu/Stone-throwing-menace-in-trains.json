    "text": "Despite a crackdown on miscreants by the railway police, incidents of stones being thrown at suburban and long-distance trains continue. Absence of illumination at some spots is reported to be the reason.\n\nThese incidents cause anxiety for police personnel. In a recent incident, a passenger on Nellai Express was injured. Railway Protection Force sources said a miscreant hurled a stone at the train, which left a passenger injured.\n\nA few weeks ago, a similar incident was reported on a suburban train. Though no one was injured, government railway police (GRP) combed the area. Officials suspected youth to be involved in the incident, in which ballast stones were thrown at the train.\n\nA senior GRP official said they picked up a few minors and let them off after a warning. \u201cPeople who throw objects at trains risk a prison term if found guilty,\u201d he said.",
