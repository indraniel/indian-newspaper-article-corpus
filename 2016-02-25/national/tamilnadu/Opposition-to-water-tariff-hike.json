    "text": "Dissent is growing among residents of Iduvai panchayat over the recent increase made in water charges and house tax.\n\nOn Wednesday, K. Thangavel, MLA (Tirupur South), along with a section of residents and CPI (M) activists, gave a representation to the panchayat administration asking to reconsider the decision to enhance the hike.\n\nThe petitioners also pointed out that a community hall constructed in the panchayat was not been utilised.\n\nK. Eswaran (CPI-M), who was a former ward member in the panchayat, said the administration had also not been giving new water connections for the past many years.\n\nWhen contacted, panchayat president S. Lakshmi said the increase in water charges from Rs.600 to Rs. 900 a year was made only because of the enhancement in charges for the water supplied to the area under the scheme promoted by New Tirupur Area Development Corporation Limited over a period.\n\nOn house tax rates, she said the revision was made only after a gap of five years which is the usual practice.",
