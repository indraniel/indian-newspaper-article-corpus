The people of Tamil Nadu are watching their dirty war of words,\u201d Dr. Anbumani said, while releasing a campaign CD of the PMK containing six songs.\n\nAn auto-rickshaw driver, two sweepers and a flower vendor received the first copy of the CD .\n\nOn whether the PMK would revive the alliance comprising the BJP and the DMDK, Dr. Anbumani said all political parties barring the DMK and the AIADMK could join the alliance.",
