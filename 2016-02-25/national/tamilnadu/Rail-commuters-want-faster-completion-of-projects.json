Krishnaswamy\n\nThe railway budget, to be presented by Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu on Thursday, has heightened expectations of commuters in the city who want the Ministry to allocate adequate funds for completing projects such as track expansion, new routes and improving the security and passenger amenities in stations.\n\nCommuters are hoping for a congestion-free travel by introducing 12-car rakes, increasing services during non-peak hours, installing closed circuit television cameras and providing better sanitation facilities in suburban railway stations.\n\nActivist V. Rama Rao said the extension of Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) project from Velachery to St. Thomas Mount was the need of the hour. He said the introduction of a day-time superfast train from Chennai Egmore to Kumbakonam and daily train services between Tambaram and Tirupati would benefit people.\n\nConsumer activist T. Sadagopan wanted the fourth line from Thiruvallur to Arakkonam, hanging in balance for more than a decade, to be completed on a priority basis. With the Thiruvallur section being the most important corridor for trains towards the rest of India, the lack of a dedicated track for long-distance trains caused delays.\n\nResidents are hopeful of an announcement about Royapuram, one of the oldest stations in the country, being made a railway terminal.\n\nP. Rajkumar of North Chennai People Rights\u2019 Federation said that when metro cities in the country had four railway terminals, Chennai had only Central and Egmore and if Royapuram could be upgraded like Tambaram, it would result in better connectivity.\n\nWomen commuters like E. Rosili of Chitlapakkam want security cover to be stepped up.\n\n\u201cWe need more CCTV cameras. It will act as a deterrent against criminals and also identify the culprits.\u201d V. Santhanam of Chromepet said the Ministry should give priority to station redevelopment projects, including escalators that work and drinking water.",
