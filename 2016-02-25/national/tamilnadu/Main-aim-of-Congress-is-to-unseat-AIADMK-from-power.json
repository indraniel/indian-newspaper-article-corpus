Karthikeyan\n\nThe prime objective of the Congress was to throw the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam out of power in the forthcoming Assembly election, said Tamil Nadu Congress Committee general secretary S.T. Nedunchezhian.\n\nThe Congress was ready to sacrifice anything to unseat Jayalalithaa. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam alliance was in a very strong position, and it would be elected to power, he said.\n\nTalking to press persons before conducting interviews to select candidates for the seven Assembly constituencies in the district here on Wednesday, he said that the AIADMK was planning to buy votes. Money would not help it in winning the election as the people across the State were highly disgusted with the government.\n\nMs. Jayalalithaa\u2019s defeat in Bargur would repeat in this election, he added.\n\nTo a question on inclusion of more parties into the alliance, he said DMK chief M. Karunanidhi would decide on having alliance with other political parties. \u201cWe are in the alliance and work for its victory,\u201d he noted.\n\nMr. Nedunchezhian said that the AIADMK cadres belittled the gods and goddess of different religions by comparing Ms. Jayalalithaa with them. Sticker culture too haunted the State, he added.\n\nThe district unit of the Congress interviewed 60 persons to select candidates for the seven Assembly constituencies. S. Abdul Gani Raja and Sivasakthi Gounder, Congress East and West district secretaries respectively, accompanied him.",
