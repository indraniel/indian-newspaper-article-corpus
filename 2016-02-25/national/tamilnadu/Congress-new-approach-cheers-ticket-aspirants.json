Many had put in decades in the party. The interview panel was led by veteran leader D. Yasoda and also comprised Congress national spokesperson and actor Khushbu.\n\nThe interaction was kept simple. Every aspirant had to answer a set of eight questions, including one on the percentage of minority population in the constituency for which they were seeking ticket. The financial strength of the person was also ascertained.\n\nMs. Yasoda posed questions that tested the aspirant\u2019s knowledge of the particular area and issues involved.\n\nTill 2011, a high-level election committee did the interviews.\n\nMs. Yasoda said the process helps to filter those who remain inactive all through but try to show themselves as hard workers just before the elections. Interviews were conducted simultaneously in all 32 districts.\n\nHowever, the process did not go without controversy. Some leaders belonging to factions of former Union Ministers P. Chidambaram and K.V. Thangkabalu kept away.",
