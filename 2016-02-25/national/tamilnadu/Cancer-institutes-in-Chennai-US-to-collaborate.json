The NCI is also looking at learning from the institute\u2019s experiences in implementing training for healthcare workers in early detection and screening.\n\nCancer Institute chairperson V. Shanta said the aim was to translate the findings of research to benefit the patient. \u201cMany of the personalised care (procedures) reach only five per cent of the population. But in a country with limited resources we need procedures that can reach a large population,\u201d she explained.\n\nDr. Shanta recalled the institute\u2019s experience in Tirunelveli, where the problem was evaluation of the camps that were held. It is in areas such as these that the institute is looking for inputs from the NCI.\n\nFrom offering pap smear test to using the visual inspection using acetic acid (VIA vili) method it was a big jump in widening the scope of the screening programme.\n\nIt had also ensured that diagnosis was done earlier. But given the huge population and the limited resources at the country\u2019s disposal, the institute was constantly trying to find low-cost options, she said.\n\nIn its ongoing screening programme in Villupuram district, which aims at covering one lakh women, the institute has moved from VIA, which is done by trained health workers, to capturing the DNA. This is one step beyond mere screening and helps to address a focused segment of women, doctors say.\n\nThe institute is currently developing an Elisa test which would provide more specificity in identifying pre-cancerous lesions.\n\nWith the results being provided within a few hours, the patient would also undergo further treatment if necessary immediately.\n\nThe test can be done at the block primary health centre level which is also equipped to offer minor corrective procedure.\n\nMeanwhile, the institute has evolved a new strategy of roping in self-help groups to spread awareness about the screening camps.",
