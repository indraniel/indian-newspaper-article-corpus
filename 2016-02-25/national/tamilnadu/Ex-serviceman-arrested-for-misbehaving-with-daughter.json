    "text": "The All Women Police here have arrested an ex-serviceman on the charges of trying to abuse his teen-aged daughter and holding a threat to the life of his wife.\n\nActing on a complaint lodged by the wife of S. Valampuri (52), who was working as watchman at a private bank, the All Women Police arrested him on Tuesday under Sections 9 (L) (n) and 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and 506 (ii) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nHe was produced before a Magistrate Court here which remanded him in judicial custody. The woman said in her complaint that the accused often touched the girl with bad intention and held her under constant threat. Though this had been going on for nearly two months, she was scarred of lodging a complaint with the police, she said.\n\nChild Welfare Committee (CWC) Chairperson R. Sakunthala, who conducted enquiries with the woman and her daughter, studying class XI in a local school, said that the police had registered the case based on the confessions of the woman and the girl, but it appeared that there were other issues involved in the matter.\n\nThe complainant said that her husband started \u201cmisbehaving\u201d with her daughter on December 24, 2015, but could not give a convincing reply as to why she had not gone to the police immediately, she said.\n\nAs both of them said that they were unsafe at home, the woman and her daughter were accommodated in a home run by a non-governmental organisation here for the time being. The CWC was taking steps to admit the girl in the school hostel and ensure that she continued her studies, she said.",
