Chandran \u2013 is monitoring the work being carried out by 30 staff in each range and the exercise which begun 15 to 20 days ago and is expected to be over soon.\n\nSummer showers\n\nOfficials said the dried up vegetation would go through the process of termite attack and would decay on its own. With summer showers in March and April and commencement of the monsoon towards the May end, the renewal of vegetation will begin immediately thereby eliminating the risk of forest fire.",
