Shaikmohideen\n\nAfter prolonged battle, 40 almost abandoned aged women finally received the orders for getting monthly old age pension on Wednesday as part of the 68th birthday celebrations of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\nThe ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, as part of the birthday celebrations of their party supremo, made arrangements for a range of events \u2013 right from cutting a 68-feet-long cake at Tuesday midnight to special prayers in places of worship and distribution of welfare measures to the needy.\n\nAfter their applications submitted on various occasions over the past nine years for getting monthly old age pension did not evoke any positive response, the old women from various parts of the city had lost their hopes of getting the assistance from the government.\n\nOn coming to know about their pathetic living conditions, Mayor E. Bhuvaneshwari received applications from these abandoned women afresh and forwarded the filled-in applications to the officials concerned on their behalf.\n\n\u201cWe received 150 applications, got them approved and handed over orders in 40 cases as the rest will be cleared before February-end,\u201d Ms. Bhuvaneshwari assured after handing over the orders to the aged beneficiaries.\n\nWhile these aged women left the Corporation with the old age pension orders, the sanitation workers of the urban civic body were seen carrying sweet boxes distributed to them as part of the Chief Minister\u2019s birthday celebrations.",
