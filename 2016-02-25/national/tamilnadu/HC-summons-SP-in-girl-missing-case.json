    "text": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the Superintendent of Police, Tiruvannamalai to appear before the court to submit the latest information on a habeas corpus petition moved to trace a minor girl who was allegedly kidnapped.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M. Sathyanarayanan made the direction as the investigating officer handling the case failed to appear or file a proper report.\n\nAccording to N. Venkatesan, a resident of Vandavasi, his 16-year-old daughter was studying class 11 in a private school in Tiruvannamalai. On December 13, 2015 she was allegedly kidnapped by Suresh, who worked as a driver to Mr. Venkatesan.\n\nThe petitioner submitted that just a few days before the incident, he sacked the driver as his character and attitude were not good.\n\n\u201cTo take revenge, Suresh along with his other family members forcibly abducted my daughter and has confined her illegally,\u201d Mr. Venkatesan said.\n\nClaiming that police officers failed to act on his complaint, the petitioner approached the court seeking a direction to trace and produce his daughter.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing, noting that the petition is pending since December last and no fruitful improvement has been reported, the Bench directed the Additional Public Prosecutor to inform the SP to present before the court during the next hearing.",
