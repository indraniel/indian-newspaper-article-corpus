There is some work left to be done before it gets launched. Passengers will be able to get information related to flight details and other such details.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if the toll-free number will also serve to take complaints, sources said.\n\nK. Neha, a first-time flier said she found it difficult to get any flight-related information when she travelled to Delhi sometime ago.\n\n\u201cI wanted to check if my flight was on time because I heard flights were delayed due to fog in Delhi. But I couldn\u2019t get through to the airlines counter number for a long time. Of course, I hear airlines do send information by text messages most of the time but I lost my mobile and was dependent on landline temporarily. So, in such situations, a toll-free number would be of great help,\u201d she added. Another passenger S. Kannabiran said the toll-free number should have a facility to incorporate passenger-related complaints.",
