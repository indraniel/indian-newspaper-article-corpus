    "text": "Parents of students of the Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School staged a protest on the campus on Tuesday alleging discrimination by the school management.\n\nSources said that the the school management reportedly refused to include for excursion a few students who had not paid the amenities fees.\n\nThe parents contention was that they were ready to pay the amenities fees provided the Inspector of the Anglo Indian School fixed the fees.\n\nThe Inspector was supposed to have fixed the fees five months ago, as per a court order.\n\nThe parents alleged that the school management had promised to take students on excursion and asked students to get parents\u2019 consent.\n\nWhen the parents provided their consent, the management had said that the tour was open for only those students who had paid the amenities fees.\n\nThe school was supposed to take the students out on February 27 (Saturday).\n\nWhen parents questioned the discrimination, the management had reportedly replied that the excursion fees fell under the \u2018amenities fees\u2019 head and that the tour was open for only those who had paid it.\n\nThis left the parents agitated. They then decided to take to the streets to protest but the management had prevented them from doing so.\n\nPrincipal Dennis Chen said that the school had denied inclusion in the excursion for only those students, fewer than 200, who had not paid any fees since the start of the academic year.\n\nExcursion was only an extra curricular activity and it had not direct relation to academics.",
