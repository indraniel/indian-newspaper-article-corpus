I am fond of nature. Due to my active engagement in politics there was a long gap. But, I restarted painting in 2010.\n\nValsaraj took up training in fine arts from the Kerala School of Arts for two years. \u2018Oil on Canvas\u2019, a painting he did in 1973 during his training in School of Arts was also on display.\n\n\u201cPeople believe that there will be no time for arts in politics. Everyone has 24 hours and it is a matter of time management. I love to paint and take time off from politics to pursue my passion,\u201d he said.\n\nAs many as 32 of his paintings were kept on display at Gandhi Thidal. From \u2018Matrimandir\u2019 in Auroville, Aayi Mandapam to knife work and collages of nature, to Kathakali dance-drama and Puthalam Temple in Mahe were painted in water colours.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a student I used more oil paint but it consumes more time. I slowly started using water colours. It is a difficult medium and challenging,\u201d he said. Mr.Valsaraj takes three to four hours to complete an art work.\n\nFrench Consul General Philippe Janvier-Kamiyama, Tourism Minister P.Rajavelu and MLA K.Lakshminarayanan were present during the inauguration.",
