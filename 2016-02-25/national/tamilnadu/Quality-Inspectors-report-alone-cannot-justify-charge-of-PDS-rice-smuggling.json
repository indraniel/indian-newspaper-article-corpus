    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has held that one cannot be prosecuted for smuggling rice meant for Public Distribution System (PDS) solely on the basis of a report issued by a Quality Inspector stating that the rice seized from the accused was PDS rice.\n\nJustice C.T. Selvam passed the order while quashing a case booked by Civil Supplies Criminal Investigation Department (CS-CID) in Dindigul district against Muthiah, arrayed as second accused, on the charge of smuggling rice owned by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation in 2009.\n\nThe judge agreed with the petitioner\u2019s counsel \u201cthat the certificate issued by the Quality Inspector would not justify the framing of charge\u201d by a judicial magistrate since the official had certified the seized rice to be PDS rice just because it happened to be \u201cdouble boiled rice emitting a particular smell.\u201d\n\nObserving that there was no bar on rice sold in open market also to be boiled twice to increase its shelf life, Mr. Justice Selvam quashed the case now pending before a Judicial Magistrate in Dindigul after taking note of the fact that the proceedings against the first accused too had been quashed by the High Court in 2014.\n\nHe stressed that in a case of smuggling of PDS rice, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove through clinching evidence that the rice seized from the accused was the one meant for distribution through ration shops and there was no possibility of it being the one sold in open market.",
