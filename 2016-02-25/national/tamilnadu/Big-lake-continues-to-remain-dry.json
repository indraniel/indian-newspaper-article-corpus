    "text": "The big lake in Vazhakombai village, near Thammampatti, continues to remain dry as monsoon has failed again. Tthe abundant presence of seemai karuvelam trees too are adversely affecting the lake.\n\nThe Vazhakombai lake in Jangasamuthiram village panchayat situated on the foot of the Kolli Hills is spread over 11 acres. This lake received copious water whenever it rains on the Kolli Hills.\n\nHowever, the repeated failure of monsoon has rendered this lake water-less for many years. The senior residents of Vazhakombai village say that this lake had filled up only twice in the last half century.\n\nThe lake fully depend on the rain water received from the Kolli Hills during the monsoon. As it is in an elevated area on the foothills, the water from the local river could not be diverted to the lake even during the floods, say the locals. The farmers of the area demand digging of pucca small canals to carry the rain water to the lake.\n\nThe filling of this lake will immensely help in improving the ground water level to a big extent in Vazhakombai, Thammampatti and Kaattukottai areas, which in turn will help the farmers dependent on well irrigation system.",
