Not only should the procedure be simplified, but also be speeded up so that there are more institutions providing quality education,\u201d said K.R. Nandhakumar, State General Secretary of the Association.\n\nHe further said that under the Right To Education (RTE) Act, the government had to settle dues of Rs. 20 crore for the year 2014-15 and Rs. 130 crore for 2015-16.\n\nThe association of private schools wants institutions\u2019 affiliation to be extended up to 5 years",
