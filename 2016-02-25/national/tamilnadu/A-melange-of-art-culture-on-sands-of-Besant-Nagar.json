We hope to put that on show for the people,\u201d K. Saravanan, an office-bearer of the Urur Kuppam Fisher Welfare Cooperative said, speaking about the Urur Olcott Kuppam Vizha that has been scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThere are many misconceptions about the fishing community, Mr Saravanan said, and he hoped it would go away with more people coming to the area to see the cultural festival. \u201cApart from Thappattam, Paraiattam and Oyilattam performances which we have lined up, many of our children too have begun to learn Bharatanatyam and will be showcasing it as well,\u201d he added.Equal platform\n\nSpeaking about the festival, T.M. Krishna, Carnatic musician and a volunteer organiser, said the aim behind organising such a festival was to give an equal platform for varied arts to come together and for people from different spheres to enjoy them.\n\n\u201cNo specific performing space or art should be put above others. In the lead-up to this festival, we have had three mini-fests with performances as well as a programme at the Ayodhya Mandapam in West Mambalam where we honoured the fisherfolk who had helped Chennai during the floods,\u201d he said.\n\nOn February 27 and 28, Villupaatu, Paraiattam, and nagaswaram programmes as well as music concerts by Raghu Dixit and Sean Roaldan and a Bharatanatyam performance by Sheejith Krishna will take place as a part of the festival.",
