    "text": "The Puducherry Central Excise and Service Tax Commissionerate has recorded very modest growth in service tax collection as well as in central excise revenue collection in the current year, Commissioner U. Niranjan said here on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking at the Central Excise Day celebrations here, he said the growth was only three per cent in Central Excise and around 17 to 18 per cent in Service Tax and was very modest when compared with the corresponding period last year.\n\nOne of the reasons for the lacklustre growth was that Puducherry has not witnessed great growth in the service sector. No new industries have really come up in this area and that may be one of the reasons for the lacklustre growth in Central Excise, he said.\n\nFor Chennai zone the targeted revenue for Central Excise has been fixed at Rs.12,600 crore and Rs.2,118 crore in service tax and the authorities are confident of reaching the targets.\n\nHowever, at the national level the Central Excise duties is very buoyant and the authorities are close to achieving the target. The reason for such high buoyancy in central excise revenues is mainly due to drop in petroleum prices from 120 dollars to 30 dollars, Mr. Niranjan said.\n\nTop contributors of revenue on central excise and service tax fronts were also honoured with the SANMAN awards on the occasion. Pondicherry University Acting Vice-Chancellor Anisa Basheer Khan and A. Syam Sundar, Joint Commissioner, Central Excise participated.",
