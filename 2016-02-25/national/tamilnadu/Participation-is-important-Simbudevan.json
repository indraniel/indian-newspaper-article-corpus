Sharing his experience with students he said that he used to participate in a lot of competitions in his school days and mostly he failed to win any prizes in the initial years.\n\nState-level prizes\n\nHowever after a period of persistent efforts he managed to get 16 state level prizes in a year. R.Venugopal, Senior Deputy Chief Designer, The Hindu, told the students that artists cannot be produced the way engineers are produced from engineering colleges.\n\nWho is a good artist?\n\nUnlike other professionals the artists are open to the criticism from members of the society. \u2018Only a good \u2018rasika\u2019 could become a good artist. Not only to become a painter, but to shine in any branches of art one need to develop the quality of appreciating beauty, he added. Principal G.Mohankumar and director V. Ramanathan were among the participants.",
