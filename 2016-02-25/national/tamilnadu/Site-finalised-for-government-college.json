    "text": "A 15-acre site at Malaiadipudur close to the Athani Road has reportedly been finalised for establishing the permanent campus for the proposed Government and Arts College for Sathyamangalam for which the State Government had already made a budgetary allocation late last year.\n\nThe Malaiadipudur Panchayat had adopted a resolution recently for handing over 15 acres of Natham Poromboke Land for the purpose, it is learnt.\n\nThe site at a distance of hardly 3km from the Sathy town limits is connected by buses plying to Kondappanaickenpalayam.\n\nThe new institution will be the first government arts and science college for the entire district. It has been a long-felt need for rural students in Sathyamangalam, Hasanur, Bhavani Sagar, Thalavadi, and Punjai Puliampatti areas in the surroundings, according to locals.\n\nThough there are a couple of private arts and science colleges in Sathy and Punja Puliampatti, the cost of higher education will be much lesser in the government colleges.\n\nThe Directorate of Collegiate Education is expected to make arrangements for conduct of classes in temporary buildings in any of the government schools until the permanent facilities are created, sources said.",
