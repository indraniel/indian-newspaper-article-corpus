    "text": "Legal aid centre would be opened in schools to offer legal aid and counselling to girl students when required. Students should be very bold while facing tough situation, said District Judge R. Poornima. Addressing a legal awareness programme for girl students organised by the District Legal Services Authority at the Government Girls Higher Secondary School here on Wednesday, she said that the number of suicides by women and girl students was on the raise. It could be owing to stress from workload in schools.\n\n\u201cDo not sacrifice your life for petty reasons. Life was given by God. Quitting your life on your own is a crime under the law. Counselling is very important for students to enable them to work under stress and pressure. If needed, a legal centre could be established in girls\u2019 schools to offer counselling,\u201d she said.\n\nGirls should talk to their mothers or to class teachers without any inhibition like they discuss issues with their friends.\n\nDindigul Town DSP R. Sigamani said girls should be extra vigilant. They should be bold and brave in handling tough situations. They should be very cautious in public places. Parents were their best friends to share their worries and happiness.",
