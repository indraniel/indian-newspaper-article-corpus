Sankaranarayanan (39), a hotel worker, his wife Usha (33) and their daughter Keerthika (9) and Sai Krishna (4) are residing in a house in G.V. Flats in Sathuvachari, Vellore. Gas from the cylinder in their kitchen had leaked inside the entire house all through the night. Little realising it Sankaranarayanan, who got up early in the morning, lit his cigarette. It immediately ignited the gas that was present in the atmosphere. On seeing the flames in the house neighbours called in fire and rescue services personnel.\n\nAll the four family members sustained burns by the time firemen rescued them. They were sent to Government Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai for treatment. Sathuvachari police have booked a case and are trying to find out the cause of the gas leak.\n\nThe gas had leaked, into the house, from the cylinder in the kitchen all through the night",
