    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association reiterated its demand for including milk and milk powder in the daily menu of the noon meal centres and anganwadi in the State.\n\nThe primary milk producers societies have been continuously refusing to procure the entire quantity of milk being supplied by the farmer members for the last one year. This has caused much financial loss to the milk farmers.\n\nThe association has been demanding the societies to ensure the procurement of entire quantity of milk.\n\nThe inclusion of milk in the daily menu of the noon meal centres will enable the milk societies to procure the entire quantity of milk being supplied by farmers.\n\nThe Chief Minister should issue orders in this regard without any further delay, a resolution adopted at a meeting of the Association held here on Tuesday said.\n\nK.G. Sengottuvel, president of the association, presided over the meeting. M.G. Rajendran, general secretary and others participated.\n\nMr. Sengottuvel told reporters here that the association had already brought the demand to the notice of the Chief Minister through a petition signed by the chairmen of the 17 district milk producers unions, chairman of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Federation, on January 27.\n\nThe association was waiting for a favourable reply from the Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, he added.\n\nIt will help milk societies procure entire milk from dairy farmers",
