MURALITHARAN\n\nSeashore, lagoons, wetlands, and lakes are said to be the preferred destinations for the winged visitors. Tiruchi does not have suitable landscape and infrastructure to lure the winged visitors.\n\nHowever, as a rare phenomenon, a large number of birds have arrived Musiri and its adjoining areas in search of food. They have been sighted on paddy fields by the village people and farmers.\n\nGrey heron, little egret, and great egret were among the birds sighted by the local people.\n\nIt is said that the left over grains strewn on the paddy fields, after the harvest, have attracted the winged visitors. They were sighted during the day.\n\n\u201cIt is rare to see birds in large numbers in our surroundings. We feel happy to see them at our doorsteps,\u201d said Rajangam of Mela Santhappalayam near Musiri.\n\nHe said the birds that came about 15 days ago were still moving around.",
