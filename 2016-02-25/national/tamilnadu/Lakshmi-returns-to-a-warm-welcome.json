Kumar\n\nLakshmi, the elephant of Sri Manakula Vinayakar temple, arrived here on Wednesday to a warm welcome after a 48-day rejuvenation camp in Thekkampatti of Coimbatore district.\n\nPriests from the temple welcomed Lakshmi as she descended from the lorry to a ramp on the Beach promenade. Special abhishekams and pujas were performed by the priests before she left for her enclosure in Sri Vedapureeswarar temple.\n\nSakthivel, one of the mahouts who accompanied Lakshmi to the camp, said that she was attached with other elephants and refused to board the truck while leaving the camp.\n\nLakshmi and Prakruthi of the Dharbaraneswara Swamy temple located in Thirunallar, Karaikal, participated in the camp for the fourth year. Lakshmi was donated to the temple as a 10-year-old when R.V. Janakiraman was the Chief Minister of Puducherry.\n\nPrakruthi at the age of 7 was brought from Karnataka to Thirunallar and now it is 11 years old.\n\n\u201cThe two elephants are in a hale and healthy condition. The health of the elephants was continuously monitored by experts in the camp and they were provided with a year long supply of vitamins and other supplements. The weight of the elephants was also recorded before leaving the camp\u201d, said N. Karunakaran, Executive officer of the temple.\n\nSpecial pujas and abhishekams were performed on her return",
