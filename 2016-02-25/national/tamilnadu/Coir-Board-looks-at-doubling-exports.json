Radhakrishnan, who recently assumed office as chairman of the Coir Board, annual exports now are to the tune of Rs. 1,600 crore. \u201cWe want to modernise the industry. New technology should be imported, if necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the Rs. 1,600 crore exports, coir pith constituted nearly Rs. 950 crore. The focus should be on improving export of value-added products.\n\nThere should be more buyer-seller meets. Coir sector consists of small-scale entrepreneurs and more number of unskilled and women workers. It is pre-dominantly a rural industry. Considering these factors, the board is aiming for huge development and support from the Government for the industry. \u201cWe will give thrust to exports,\u201d he said. With regard to the growing market for coir products, he said the potential is huge. However, the market is unorganised and the board is considering measures for collection of data to estimate the market size.\n\nThe industry now faces shortage of raw material. To address this, Coir Board will also work closely with the Coconut Board.\n\nThere must be a special insurance scheme for coconut farms and a scheme to encourage replanting of coconut trees. Fibre yield reduces with the age of the tree. Hence, farmers should be encouraged to go in for replanting, he said.\n\nCoir Board will soon set up a regional office in Pollachi at a total cost of Rs. 8 crore.\n\nThe office will have a training centre, display area for coir products, and conference hall. It also proposes to digitalise Coir Board activities and facilitate linkage of coir product manufacturers with e-commerce portals.",
