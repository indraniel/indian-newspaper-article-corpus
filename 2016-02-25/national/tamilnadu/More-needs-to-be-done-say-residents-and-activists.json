    "text": "The city is indeed safer compared to other metros. But much needs to be done in ensuring safety of its residents, particularly women, and to reduce crimes with coordinated efforts from various government agencies.\n\nReacting to the Mercer\u2019s Quality of Living ranking survey that rated Chennai the safest Indian city, residents said that though people feel safer here when compared to other metros like Delhi, it did not mean that the city was entirely safe in terms of secure public spaces and less crime rate.\n\n\u201cChennai is safe compared to other cities. People may have a better sense of safety unlike in Delhi or other cities. We can see police even during night time. But, safety of women in public spaces still remains a problem,\u201d said Prasanna Gettu, CEO and founder trustee of International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC).\n\nThe organisation had conducted a research among college students recently wherein they spoke about unsafe environment in public transport system and desolate streets during late evenings. \u201cWe need to have collective responsibility and coordinated approach among government agencies like Chennai Corporation, the Transport Department and residents to ensure safe environment in city,\u201d she said.\n\nActivists like Sujata Mody asked what had been done structurally in the city to ensure citizens\u2019 safety.\n\nFor instance, she said the number of private taxi operators had increased in recent years. But, very little had been done to collate data on drivers or monitor them to step up passenger safety.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances of women working in export companies being attacked while returning home through dark lanes. But, many of them do not report it as it may curb their freedom. There is a lack of coordination among government agencies in providing a secure environment. Simple measures like providing better lighting on roads and railway stations will be of help,\u201d said Ms. Mody, president of Working Women\u2019s Association.",
