Special WhatsApp groups are in place for cadres in every district. A recent \u2018missed call campaign\u2019, which would be reciprocated by a voice message from the DMK president M.Karunanidhi, has recorded 30 lakh missed calls already.\n\nWorkshops\n\nThe party has been organising workshops for party cadres on how to run an integrated campaign, harnessing the power of digital and social media in addition to on-ground strategies. While many figures have floated around on the money spent for the campaign, a senior JWT official, closely associated with the campaign has said that the numbers were a small fraction of the figures floating around.",
