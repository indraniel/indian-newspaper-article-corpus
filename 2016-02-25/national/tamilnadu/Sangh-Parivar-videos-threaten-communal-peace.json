The party urged the Tamil Nadu government to crack down on such videos.\n\nIn a statement here on Wednesday, the TMMK said that the BJP has been indulging in politics of hate before the election. \u201cJust like they did in parts of North India, the Sangh Parivar is trying to foment unrest between Hindus and Muslims,\u201d the statement said. The video portrays Muslims as perpetrators of violence and might instigate the Hindus to act against them. \u201cThe Chief Minister must look into the matter and take action,\u201d the statement said.",
