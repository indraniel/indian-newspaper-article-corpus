    "text": "A septuagenarian advocate who accused the First Bench of the Madras High Court of functioning like a Katta Panchayat (kangaroo court) has been debarred from legal practice by the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.\n\nThe advocate, Ra Muthukrishnan, made the accusation last December when the First Bench was hearing his review petition challenging the dismissal of his public interest litigation petition against the rule mandating two-wheeler riders and pillion riders to wear helmets. The court had also imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on the litigant.\n\nDuring the hearing by the Chief Justice S.K. Kaul, the advocate repeatedly contended that the order imposing cost on him was a reflection of \u201canger\u201d, \u201cirksome\u201d and \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of the situation.\n\nHe alleged that the action was akin to a penalty imposed by a kangaroo court.\n\nThe Bench castigated him and referred the matter to the State Bar Council and imposed an additional cost of Rs. 10,000 on the lawyer.\n\nThe Bar Council acknowledged that\n\nthe advocate has committed professional misconduct",
