    "text": "Narendra Modi-led Central Government was working for the welfare of corporate companies as it was under the impression the latter\u2019s growth was tantamount to nation\u2019s growth, said Ramendra Kumar, president, All India Trade Union Congress, in Coimbatore on Wednesday.\n\nAddressing reporters, he said that nation\u2019s development began with the increase in the purchase of the common man and people at the lower end of the development chain. But that was not the case.\n\nMr. Kumar charged the Central Government with trying to take away the rights of privileges of the labourers by trying to amend labour laws so as to suit corporate companies. He also criticised the Government\u2019s handling of the students\u2019 protest in the Hyderabad Central University and Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nMr. Kumar is in the city to participate in the AITUC 41{+s}{+t}conference that is starting on Thursday.",
