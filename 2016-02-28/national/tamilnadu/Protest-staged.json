    "text": "Condemning the Namakkal municipality\u2019s efforts to discharge sewage into a lake located at Maroorpatti panchayat, villagers besieged the earthmovers and staged a protest here on Saturday.\n\nThe municipality has proposed to carry the sewage through pipelines from Mudalaipatti Pudur and release it into the lake in the panchayat for which the bhumi puja was performed last week. But villagers, led by its president, opposed the project and submitted petition to the Collector. Hence, a survey was conducted to fix the boundary of villages in the panchayat. Villagers also dumped mud on the pipeline route.",
