The ONGC was engaged in crude oil extraction in the region. They alleged that the ONGC operations had adversely impacted their fields and spillages were affecting the humans and cattle alike. Groundwater table has plummeted and ecology was affected, they claimed. Police and revenue officials held discussions with the agitating villagers and pacified them.",
