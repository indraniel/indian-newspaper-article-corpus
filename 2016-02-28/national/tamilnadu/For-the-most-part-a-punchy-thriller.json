    "text": "Afew minutes into Kanithan , directed by T.N. Santhosh, I was ready to check out. We are at the Sky TV office, and Manobala plays the CEO. That says it all. This isn\u2019t about the actor. This is about what he\u2019s asked to do, almost always\u2014you could call it \u201cthe Manobala part,\u201d the efficacy of which peaked some 283 movies ago. He makes a joke about the channel being in the No. 48 position, and he predicts that in a year it will be (drumroll)... No. 46.\n\nAnd soon we realise that jokes can get worse. Because Gowtham (Atharvaa), who\u2019s in a bar with a friend (Sunder Ramu), gets all love-at-first-sight with Anu (Catherine Tresa), and when she orders a tequila, the friend orders a... Shakila.\n\nAnd then Gowtham gets slapped across the face, and everything changes. Till the slap, we\u2019re still wondering if it wouldn\u2019t be easier to stay at home and roll around in a bed of nails. You\u2019d get the same effect \u2013 without the cost of a ticket. Gowtham is explaining to Anu something about why good-looking girls always fall for mokka men, and... SLAP! Out of nowhere, a cop\u2019s palm crashes into his face. And the film takes off.\n\nGowtham and his friends are picked up for questioning because they\u2019re believed to be part of a ring that forges degree certificates.\n\nThis is a solid angle for a film with a young hero. It hints at undeserving people with money buying an education they did not work towards, and becoming unqualified professionals \u2013 more fish in the sea of mediocrity that is India. And this makes Gowtham very, very angry.\n\nHe\u2019s angrier because one of the co-arrestees has a father\u2014in Tiruchi\u2014who needs a bypass surgery. The mother is waiting (and wailing) at the hospital, hoping he\u2019ll get the money and shut up the heartless hospital attendant, who yells that if the fees aren\u2019t paid the next day, the father will be discharged without surgery\u2014he\u2019ll have to be taken to the government hospital. The son commits suicide, and this is no spoiler. For we are in a Shankar movie\u2014but without the vigilante justice. Translation: the villain Thura Sarkar (Tarun Arora) doesn\u2019t end up screaming in a vat of boiling oil.\n\nAs in Thani Oruvan , we see an increasingly tense cat-and-mouse game between well-matched (and brainy) adversaries. Kanithan is a two-sided procedural, with both Gowtham and Thura Sarkar putting together the pieces that will lead them to each other. There are some tense moments. The editor (Bhuvan Srinivasan) really goes for the jugular.\n\nFor a change, the media aren\u2019t painted as sensation-mongering opportunists.\n\nI wish the cop played by K. Bhagyaraj had been given more to do. I wish I hadn\u2019t been able to predict the death of a major character. And I wish the director hadn\u2019t chickened out in the second half and felt the need to alleviate the grimness with a mood-killing song.\n\nBut even this is a sign that the movie is working\u2014for when the song ends, the film tautens again. The messagey portions, thankfully, are kept to a minimum, but we do get this line: \u2018 Indha kaalathula thappu pannravangala kooda vittuduvaanga. Aana thatti kekkaravangala kandippa nasukkiduvaanga.. \u201d (These days, they\u2019ll even forgive sinners. But if you raise your voice against injustice, they\u2019ll crush you.) Sounds like the headlines, no?\n\nbaradwaj rangan\n\nKanithan\n\nGenre:Thriller\n\nDirector:T.N. Santhosh\n\nCast:Atharvaa Murali, Catherine Tresa, K.
