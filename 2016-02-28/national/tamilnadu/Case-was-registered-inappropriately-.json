Kathir, Executive Director of Evidence, said that the police initially hesitated to register a case but later registered without invoking the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act and the SC/ST Prevention of Authorities Act.\n\n\u201cOnly under those acts, the boy will be eligible for compensation and rehabilitation. The guilty will also be punished severely,\u201d he said.\n\nA police official from Karimedu, however, said that appropriate sections had been invoked as per the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe scene of crime is Mumbai. So, we will be transferring the case,\u201d he said.\n\nM.R. Vairamuthu Raju, GRH Dean, said that the decision was taken in consultation with boy\u2019s family and after assessment of the wound.\n\n\u201cIf they think more treatment is needed, we are happy to admit them again,\u201d he said.",
