    "text": "Air passengers had a harrowing experience at Thoothukudi airport in Vagaikulam on Saturday as an aircraft, which was scheduled to leave for Chennai, suffered a breakdown. The rear door of the flight could not be opened owing to some technical glitch, reliable sources from the airport said. Since there was no indication about the condition of the door, the cockpit had not received any clearance to take off the flight, which was about to depart at 10.30 a.m. Sixty two passengers were said to have booked tickets for their journey to Chennai. However, the stranded passengers were boarded in five buses, which carried them to the Madurai airport to board a Chennai-bound flight. A team of aircraft maintenance engineers from Chennai would attend to the problem and set it right in the flight, sources added.",
