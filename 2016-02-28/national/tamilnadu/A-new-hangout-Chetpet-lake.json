    "text": "The Chief Minister inaugurated a Rs. 42-cr. eco-park with a raft of attractions\n\nChief Minister Jayalalithaa on Saturday inaugurated the eco-park at Chetpet through video conferencing.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of the Rs.42-crore project, a huge crowd thronged the eco-park.\n\nThe sprawling lake that is now brimming with water provided a visual feast with boat jetties going around a natural island. Spread over 16 acres, the lake, which is located in the heart of the city, will provide visitors a chance to enjoy boat rides, fish with dedicated angling spots and go for a leisurely stroll on the footpath.\n\nThe waterbody abounds with a variety of fish, including rohu, cutla, mrigal and pangasius. It has a capacity to store 1.44 lakh cubic metres of rainwater. To promote bio-diversity, hundreds of rare saplings have been planted around the lake, which is expected to attract a number of bird species. The facility also has a pollination park and a 1.5 kilometre-long walking track. A seafood court on the premises is also part of the project.\n\nFacilities to monitor the water quality of the lake have been commissioned. A parking lot has been developed to house 66 cars and 100 motorcycles. Meanwhile, the WRD has plans for eco-restoration of lakes in the western suburbs.",
