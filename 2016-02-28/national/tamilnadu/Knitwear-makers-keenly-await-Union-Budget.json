Dhananjayan, a senior member of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\nThe knitwear manufacturers feel that it would become easy to get rebate claims under the VAT Act.\n\nPreparations of financial statements for individual firms will also become easier and the manufacturers will be enthused to augment production, said G.R. Senthilvel, secretary of Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association.\n\n\u201cGST system will end black marketing, bring more revenue to governments\u201d",
