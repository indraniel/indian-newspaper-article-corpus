According to police, Vinod Raj had placed an online advertisement to rent out his camera. On February 8, he got a call from a man named Shiva, who told Vinod that he would send his assistant Karthik to his office to collect the camera.\n\nWhen Karthik arrived, Vinod asked him for an identity proof to which the former replied that Shiva had mailed him. Before Vinod could check his mail, Karthik fled with the camera. Vinod filed a complaint, and submitted CCTV footage to the police. With the help of the footage, the police arrested Karthik, and recovered the camera. \u2014staff reporter",
