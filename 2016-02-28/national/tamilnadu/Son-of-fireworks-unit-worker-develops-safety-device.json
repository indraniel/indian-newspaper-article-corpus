The boy was not well-versed in English, but spoke impeccable Tamil and had the audience enthralled with his knowledge, for which he earned a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cThe device works based on an alarm circuit completed by a heat sensor. One of the main reasons for fire accidents is friction, which will increase the temperature. Any rise in the room temperature will trigger this device,\u201d said Jayakumar. The device is not just an alarm; the circuit is connected to a water tank and a motor, which will sprinkle water in the factory, dousing the fire. Three years ago, Jayakumar\u2019s mother Panjavarnam had sustained severe burn injuries in an accident at a fireworks factory. That had a lasting impact on the young boy. Karunaidas, his science teacher was discussing a project to develop a mobile app to alert the fire service and police station of fire mishap in the fireworks factories in Sivakasi.\n\nHe recalled that Jayakumar stood up in the class questioned the use of such an app.\n\n\u201cHe said the focus should be to prevent mishaps, which changed the project's focus altogether,\u201d recalled Mr. Karunaidas.\n\nThe fire safety device is not his first project. He had developed an LPG gas leak alarm two years ago, based on the same principle, with a gas sensor.\n\nThe project won him national recognition .",
