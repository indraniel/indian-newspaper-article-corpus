    "text": "Decision only after VC is appointed, says academic council chairman\n\nMembers of the academic council of the University of Madras were upset that the council chairman refused to pass any resolution on the issue of double evaluation.\n\nAt the council meeting, with around 240 members, on Saturday several teachers raised the issue.\n\nJ. Gandhiraj of Vivekananda College said double evaluation would make the process not only error-free and also benefit the examinee and the examiner.\n\nAt present, answer papers are evaluated by one teacher and a student who is not satisfied with the evaluation process would have to apply for revaluation.\n\n\u201cThe present system of evaluation is subjective, so at least for PG courses double evaluation must be considered,\u201d Prof. Gandhiraj said. Another professor said students who could not afford to spend Rs. 1,000 for revaluation suffered the most.\n\nPrincipal of Patrician College Fathima Vasanth said evaluators had the tendency to mark students in a certain range without even assessing their answer sheets. She called for accountability from the evaluators pointing out that often the chief examiner was either absent of was present for only a few hours.\n\nAnother council member blamed poor evaluation on the chief examiners who often did not turn up at the evaluation centre or came late and did not take their job seriously. Members said since students were at the mercy of evaluators it was imperative that the university consider reverting to the double evaluation process.\n\nSyndicate member R. Shanthi replied that the current process of revaluation was implemented following a recommendation in November 2009 by the then higher education secretary.\n\nChecks and balances\n\nMembers returned to debate on the issue after other items on the agenda were taken up. At one point a member G. Palani called for a system of \u2018checks and balances\u2019 in the evaluation process.\n\nDespite several representations from the members that the council pass a resolution on the issue, the chairman of the convenor committee Jothi Sivagnanam said only when a new Vice Chancellor is appointed will the issue be considered.",
