But the stigma attached to mental disorders and suicide deters those in need from seeking help,\u201d said Lakshmi Vijayakumar, Organising Secretary of SNEHA.\n\nN. Ram, Chairman, Kasturi & Sons Ltd, who presided over the conference, pointed to Simon Cross\u2019s report on why the \u2018copycat\u2019 theory on suicide coverage is a \u2018conceptual red herring\u2019.\n\n\u201cA single suicide leaves behind a long trail of tragedy, affecting families and others around, as it more or less reflects copycat actions. Journalists must be very careful in publishing suicide cases, and in cases of negligence, they must be chastised. It is extremely important to exercise sensitivity, empathy and send out a powerful message to bring down the numbers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, people who talk about suicide may be reaching out for help. Communities play a critical role in suicide prevention by providing social support to such people, fighting stigma and supporting those bereaved by suicide,\u201d said Mr. Saxena.\n\n\u201cStigma attached to mental disorders and suicide deters those in need from seeking help\u201d",
