Sasidharan passed the order on a suit moved by the Adani Group against its lawyer Kabilan Manoharan of Ms KabiLaw Attorneys-at-law claiming that he threatened to make public at least a dozen of alleged illegalities the group had committed in purchasing lands for its solar power projects in Tamil Nadu.\n\nAccording to the applicant, the Gujarat-based company engaged the lawyer based in Chennai to verify the title deeds of thousands of acres of land proposed to be purchased in Ramanathapuram district for establishing 648-MW solar plant, with a view to avoiding possible litigation in future. The company alleged that the lawyer, after scrutinising the documents relating to 1,800 acres of land and receiving an amount of Rs.70 lakh as fees, threatened to expose all the professional communications made between them.\n\nAs per the agreement executed between the company and the advocate, it was agreed to pay Rs. 6,000 per acre as lawyer\u2019s fee which will be disbursed in three stages. So far the company has paid Rs. 70 lakh as fees to the advocate. On January 4, through a communication the lawyer called upon the company to revise from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 15,000 per acre and demanded a further payment of Rs.1.43 crore.\n\nClaiming that the company had not indulged in any kind of acts or omissions which would constitute fraud, it moved the High Court for an injunction.\n\nHe threatened to disclose alleged illegalities the group committed in purchasing lands",
