    "text": "A few days ago the Coimbatore Corporation conducted a foundation-stone laying ceremony on a reserved site in Vilankurichi. The ceremony was to kick start the construction of a urban health centre on a 63-cent reserved site in G.R.D. Residency.\n\nThe corporation had planned the 5,000-sq ft-centre at over Rs. 70 lakh.\n\nThe centre is one among the three that the civic body has proposed to construct under the Union Government-funded National Urban Health Mission.\n\nBut the ceremony seems to have landed the civic body in trouble as the reserved site has been earmarked for park and playfield, where no other development can take place. The residents too have objected to the construction of a hospital there.\n\nA resident said that of the 63 cents, 13 cents had already been taken away for the construction of a library and a water tank. Their only hope for recreation and sports activity was the 50 cents and if that too were to be taken away, it would be unfair.\n\nThe residents had every right to protest the move as the corporation\u2019s proposal for the health centre construction was also patently illegal, said S.P. Thiyagarajan, Organiser, Tamil Nadu Reserved Site Protection Committee.\n\nThe law clearly stated that reserved sites could not be used for other than the intended purpose. If at all the civic body had to do so, it had to have a Government Order. There were court rulings that prohibited such misuse, he added.\n\nSources in the corporation said that after the residents had raised objection and activists had raised the issue of misuse of reserved site, a clarification had been sought from the town planning section about the reserved site. If the site were to be earmarked park, the civic body would look for an alternative land.",
