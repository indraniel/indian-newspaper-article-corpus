Rajkumar presented a report card on the status of projects he had announced in the last Budget.\n\nMaking a departure from previous Budgets when no such progress of projects were presented, the Mayor devoted more than three pages to list out the status of all projects in a vague manner.\n\nHe said that the construction and renovation of urban health centres, construction of integrated bus stand in Vellalore, lorry parking yard, multi-level car parking in Gandhipuram, R.S. Puram, and Town Hall, digging a tunnel in Periya Combai and Kattan hillocks to lay Pilloor drinking water pipeline and underground drainage for added areas were progressing.\n\nMr. Rajkumar said that the corporation had provided wi-fi at a few public places, as promised. It was on the verge of completing the pexdestrian bridge near the Avinashilingam University and had made progress in erecting similar ones near Hope College Junction, Aravind Eye Hospital and near Kuniamuthur bus.\n\nThe civic body was on the verge of laying the synthetic hockey turf at the R.S. Puram higher secondary school.\n\nThe proposals for Vadavalli bus terminus, treatment plant at Singanallur tank, vegetable market in Kurichi and a few other projects were with the State Government for consideration, he added.",
