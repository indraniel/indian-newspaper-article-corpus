    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would like to have a friendly government at the helm in Tamil Nadu after the Assembly elections. Consequently, the alliance formation for the elections would be focussed on that aspect, BJP National Executive member and former State party president C.P. Radhakrishnan said here on Saturday.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan told presspersons that his party had entered into electoral alliances with major parties in the State save the Congress and the Communists. In entering into electoral alliance, parties needed to adopt a give-and-take approach. \u201cOur party national president Amit Shah will soon form an electoral alliance in Tamil Nadu that will reflect the people\u2019s preference,\u201d he said.\n\nA significant chunk of the State people had been sucked into liquor bottle.\n\nTo redeem the drowning Tamil society, the State Government must immediately, before Assembly elections were announced, implement total prohibition and save the masses, Mr. Radhakrishnan said.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan said the Railway Budget had revived several pending rail projects.\n\nThe budget had allocated Rs. 2,064 crore to several projects in the State and that was a welcome development.",
