Murugan, district secretary of Adi Tamilar Peravai, said that around 2 a.m. on Saturday unidentified persons barged into the houses of himself, Sasidharan, Kuppuraj, Vinod, Devaraj and Saravanan stating that they were police from Palladam in Tirupur district. They were looking for some valuables that an accused reportedly sold through someone in the locality.\n\nWhen they could not find anything, they picked two for questioning. They said they would organise a protest in the city on March 7 to condemn the police action.",
