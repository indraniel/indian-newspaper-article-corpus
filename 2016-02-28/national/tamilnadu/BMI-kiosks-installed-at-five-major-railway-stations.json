    "text": "The Salem Railway Division has installed BMI (Body Mass Index) kiosks at Coimbatore, Salem, Tirupur, Erode and Karur railway stations.\n\nThe BMI kiosks will enable the people to know the body mass index and guide them towards a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe Indian Medical Research Council (IMRC) has recently fixed the average weight for men as 60 kg. and women as 55 kg. in India. The BMI kiosks in the lines of the earlier coin operated weight showing machines, will be showing the height, weight and the BMI of the user (like underweight, normal and healthy weight, overweight and obese) free of cost.\n\nIn addition, the machine will also give advice as to the requirement of water intake for the user based on his/her BMI. If opted, the user can input his/her 10 digit mobile number in the machine, so that the machine will send an SMS providing all the details for a permanent record. When the user provides the same mobile number next time, the SMS will include comparative figures of the height, weight and BMI in comparison with the last time.\n\nThe kiosks have been installed by Orange Innovations and Amsoft Services at a cost of Rs. 2.5 lakh.\n\nDivisional Manager of Salem Railway Division Shubhranshu said that the kiosks will help the rail passengers to lead a healthy life style. The Salem division has proposed to intal BMI kiosks in many stations soon, he said.",
