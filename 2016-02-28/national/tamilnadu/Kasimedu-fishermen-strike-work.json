    "text": "They demand withdrawal of amendments to Marine Fisheries Regulation Act\n\nA section of fishermen at Kasimedu struck work on Saturday demanding withdrawal of amendments to the Tamil Nadu Marine Fisheries Regulation Act, 1983, that were passed by the State legislature recently.\n\nAt least three associations \u2014 Singaravelar Siriya Engine Visai Padagu Thozhilalar Sangam (workers union), Jeevarathnam Gillnet Thoondil Visai Padagu Sangam and Chennai-Chengai Singaravelar Visai Padagu Urimaiyalar Sangam (boat owners association) \u2014 have tied up the smaller boats at the fishing harbour saying that their livelihood would be badly affected if the amendments were to come into force.\n\n\u201cThey have increased the horse power of mechanised boats, which will only lead to more problems for us. We fish close to the coast and when mechanised boats get more engine power that will lead to our nets being damaged and fishing activity coming to a halt,\u201d said M. Vijaesh of the Urimaiyalar Sangam. \u201cIt will only help fisherfolk from down south as they have more powerful engines. We don\u2019t want such crafts to fish in our waters. We have been protesting against boats with more than 150 hp in our fishing grounds,\u201d said Arasu, president of the Owners Association.",
