    "text": "Residents of Krishna Nagar and Jayalakshmi Nagar under Pallavaram Municipality and members of residents\u2019 forums from Moovarasanpettai are determined to put an end to sewage being let into the rejuvenated Moovarasanpettai Lake.\n\nOn Friday, members of residents\u2019 welfare associations in these areas asked contractors to stop the construction of stormwater drains (SWDs), claiming that they were having a deleterious effect on the lake. As this exercise did not yield the desired results, a delegation of office bearers from the Federation of Moovarasanpettai Residents Welfare Associations met the Block Development Officer, St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union, to apprise him of the serious impact of the SWD project. A petition has been mailed to District Collector too, they said.\n\nFederation of Moovarasanpettai Residents Welfare Associations secretary, G.P. Babu, alleged that the Tirusulam village panchayat was constructing a culvert on Moovarasanpettai Main Road, which links Madipakkam and Tirusulam, to let domestic sewage into the lake.\n\nAccording to sources with the Tirusulam panchayat, the work is being carried out by using funds provided under special flood mitigation scheme for St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union.\n\nJayalakshmi Nagar Residents Welfare Association secretary S. Ramakumar said they had already cautioned the officials about problems posed by these SWDs, which would end up being only carriers of sewage into the lake.\n\nResidents appealed to the State government to instruct the nearby village panchayats to construct sewage treatment plants on their own, until an underground drainage scheme is drawn up for the southern suburbs.",
