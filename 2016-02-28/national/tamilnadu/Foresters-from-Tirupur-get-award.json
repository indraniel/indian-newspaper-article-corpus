Narashimmaraj received cash awards and citations from Principal Chief Conservator of Forests N. Krishnakumar recently.\n\nDistrict Forest Officer A. Periasamy told The Hindu that the five men acted on intelligence gathered from various sources about the planned trade of animal skin and arrested Moideen Basha (30), who ran an eatery at Udumalpet, and five others in December 2015.\n\nThe arrest initially helped the officials to seize only a tiger skin. Further inquiry led to the seizure of leopard and barking deer skin too from a house, the officials said.",
