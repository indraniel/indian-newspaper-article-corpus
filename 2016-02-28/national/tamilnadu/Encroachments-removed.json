    "text": "Coimbatore Corporation on Saturday removed encroachments near the Sathyamangalam Road. According to Town Planning Officer in-charge S. Ravichandran, the officials removed the compound wall of a gated community under construction for 1.3km to establish a link between Sathyamangalam Road and Keeranatham Main Road.\n\nThe gated community promoter had handed over a portion of the site to the civic body in 2007 but thereafter the promoter had fenced it and then erected security cabins and constructed tanks. Following complaints, the civic body demolished those and the compound wall.\n\nIn some places along the 1.3 km stretch, the land width was 24 m and at others nine m. Work was in progress as of Saturday evening as the Corporation had planned to lay a pucca road.\n\nLikewise, the corporation cleared encroachments near the G.P. Theatre. Mr. Ravichandran said that the retrieved land was close to 9,000 sqft. The encroachments had to be removed to facilitate the shifting of three temples from Gandhipuram as the structures stood in the way.\n\nThe district administration and corporation had planned to shift the Muneeswaran, Ganapathy and Mariamman temples from near the Gandhipuram junction to facilitate the flyover construction.",
