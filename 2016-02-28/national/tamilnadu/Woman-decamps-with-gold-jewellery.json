Thangaraj (54) from Appakarai near Peraiyur, a woman with a toddler came to his house on Wednesday. She allegedly introduced herself as a classmate of Thangaraj\u2019s daughter when the two were in Class 12 and that she had moved to Thoothukudi since then.\n\nBelieving in her claims, Thangaraj extended hospitality to her, the police said. In the afternoon, as Thangaraj had to leave for work, he asked the woman to wait at home until his daughter arrived.\n\nHowever, when Thangaraj\u2019s daughter reached home, she allegedly found the house locked. When she contacted Thangaraj over phone, he narrated what had happened.\n\nOn entering the house after opening it with help from a neighbour, Thangaraj\u2019s daughter found that the woman had decamped with four sovereigns of gold jewellery kept in the cupboard.\n\nA case was registered on Friday.",
