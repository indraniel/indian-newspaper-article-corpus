Ramadoss and the party's chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss at the party's conference in Vandalur on Saturday.\u2014 Photo: G.Krishnaswamy.\n\nPMK\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss on Saturday said he would vacate the office of Chief Minister and leave it to a competent person the moment he realises that he is unable to fulfil the promises made to the people of Tamil Nadu.\n\nAddressing the party\u2019s State conference at Vandalur through a documentary on his achievements as the Union Health Minister, Dr. Anbumani said his goal was not to merely occupy the Chief Minister\u2019s chair but bring in sustainable development.\n\nThe meeting also saw on the dais veteran PMK leaders like P.T. Arulmozhi and former MP Vandavasi Durai who had rejoined the party.\n\nA resolution adopted at the conference also vowed to end the rule of the two major Dravidian parties and called upon the people to elect Dr. Anbumani as the Chief Minister.\n\nThe PMK alone can end all the evils affecting Tamil Nadu and place it on the path of progress, the resolution said.\n\nAlleging that the two Dravidian parties had ravaged natural resources, indulged in corruption and promoted liquor sale, the resolution said both the AIADMK and the DMK were responsible for converting Tamil Nadu, a wealthy and naturally resourceful State into a poor and drought-affected State.\n\nThe people are caught between the devil and the deep sea. On the one hand the government is distributing freebies and on the other doing harm through Tasmac shops, the resolution said.",
