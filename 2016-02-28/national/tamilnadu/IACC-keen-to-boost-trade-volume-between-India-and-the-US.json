Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nThe Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) has taken effective steps to increase trade volume between India and the United States, in the overall interest of the Indian trade community, said N. V. Srinivasan, Regional president for South, IACC, here, on Saturday.\n\nHe was delivering his inaugural address at the day-long \u2018Salem MSME summit on growth and prospects of MSME sector in the emerging scenario\u2019 organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Salem, in association with the IACC.\n\nMr. Srinivasan said that when Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States, visited India last year, he favoured increasing trade between both the countries from the present 110 billion U.S. dollars to 500 billion dollars.\n\nThe U.S. President Obama, while addressing the Indian Parliament, underlined the importance of both the countries strengthening their partnership in the industrial and business front. He favoured creation of opportunities for trading community of both the countries.\n\nMr. Srinivasan said that the IACC has been holding consultative meetings in various parts of the country to discuss and provide suggestions to the Indian industries for increasing their trade with the U.S.\n\nThe objective of the exercise is to increase the trade between both the countries from the present 110 billion U.S. dollars to 500 billion dollars by 2018.\n\nThe IACC had already held the meetings in Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, which evoked good response. The respective governments in these States too have evinced lot of interest.\n\nMr. Srinivasan said that IACC has planned a similar meeting in Chennai by May. Similar meetings are on the anvil in Hyderabad and Cochin shortly. He said that small and medium enterprises (SME) played a crucial role in the overall development of countries. IACC has facilitated the visit of many US delegations to India.

He strongly advocated establishment of a support system for the SMEs and also increasing the benchmark from the present Rs. 5 crore to more than Rs. 25 crore.\n\nK.M.S.
