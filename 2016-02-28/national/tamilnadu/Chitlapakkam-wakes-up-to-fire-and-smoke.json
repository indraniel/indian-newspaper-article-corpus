    "text": "A fire broke out in the garbage dumping ground in Chitlapakkam in the early hours of Saturday. It took a while for residents of Chitlapakkam to realise that the thick white sheet that had descended upon the area was smoke.\n\nIt is said that the fire which broke out at around 3 a.m. spread rapidly, aided by the strong winds. The smoke billowing from the dumping ground caused discomfort to motorists using the stretch.\n\nTalking to The Hindu, the executive officer of Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat R. Chandramohan said that there was no damage to property. \u201cThe fire has been put out and as a precaution water is being sprayed to ensure that there is no hidden source that would ignite the fire again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur major concern was to ensure that the fire does not spread to the nearby huts. As many as five fire tenders were pressed into service and water tankers were used till the fire was extinguished and then two trucks were used as a precautionary measure,\u201d the fire-fighting staff said.\n\nThis is the second major fire mishap taking place in the dumping ground with the first one happening in November 2012, which spread to the nearby Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) centre damaging furniture and records.",
