    "text": "The district unit of Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary Post Graduate Teachers Association (TNHSPGTA) has urged the Education Department to allot duty for all teachers within 15 km radius from the school for the ensuing board examinations.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Joint Director of Education (in-charge), association president A. Ramu said that as per the examination rules, duty should be allotted to department officer, additional department officer, hall supervisor and flying squad and all examination related duties within 15 km radius from the school location. The president said that providing duty at centres that were located at far away from the school will cause hardship to the teachers that will finally affect their performance.\n\nThe memorandum also said that all schools should be informed through email on the duty allotted for flying squad members, which should comprise only PG teachers and physical education directors.\n\nThe member of the flying squad should also receive details of duty allocated through SMS and steps should be taken to rectify the mistakes pointed out by the squad everyday. Squad members should be paid their remuneration at the end of their duty and pregnant and unwell teachers should not be given the duty, the memorandum urged.",
