Ramachandran and Rajinikanth.\n\n\u201cWe are into telecom and that will be our primary business. Making movies is my passion. Sri Lankan Tamils are big fans of Tamil films. It been my desire to produce movies,\u201d says Mr. Allirajah who was in Chennai to meet actor Rajinikanth who is playing the lead in 2.0 , a sequel to the actor\u2019s earlier smash hit, Enthiran .\n\nHe says his group is waiting for the government to liberalise the telecom market in India. \u201cThe MVNO (Mobile phone Virtual Network) market is yet to open up in India and we will definitely enter the Indian market,\u201d Mr. Allirajah says.\n\nAsked if he thought he could make inroads in a country where there are big telecom majors, he says, \u201cThe Indian market is big enough to accommodate everyone.\u201d\n\nAt a time when the Tamil film industry is going through a rough patch, Lyca Productions has plans to invest Rs. 350 crore for Enthiran\u2019s sequel, 2.0 .\n\n\u201cWe are here to produce great movies. All our films will be director-driven. For the right project, we will replenish the yearly budget to Rs. 1,000 crore if needed,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cI hope these investments will take Tamil and Indian cinema to world-class standards.\u201d\n\nRough ride\n\nThe ride has not been smooth for Subaskaran in Tamil Nadu. Lyca Productions\u2019 maiden venture Kaththi , featuring actor Vijay in the lead role, faced severe protests from several small and influential political parties on the grounds that he had business links with former SL president Mahinda Rajapakse.\n\nWhile the production house recently distributed two well-known movies, Naanum Rowdy Dhaan and Visaranai , without any hiccups, Subaskaran explains away the incidents to \u2018miscommunication\u2019. \u201cA lot was miscommunicated and misunderstood. I also think the protests could have been encouraged by some vested interests,\u201d he says.\n\nAsked if his group would be picking up stakes in traditional media houses, Subaskaran insists that the group has no such plans. He says, \u201cI am a businessman. Getting into media business would mean being on the wrong side politically. I want to remain politically neutral at all times,\u201d he says firmly.\n\nLyca Productions is already producing big-ticket films and has tied up with biggest of stars",
