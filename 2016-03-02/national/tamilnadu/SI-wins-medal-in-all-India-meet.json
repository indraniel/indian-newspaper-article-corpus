Manivannan here and showed him the certificates and cheques.\n\nThe SP suggested that Mr. Saravanan, presently attached to SB CID wing, could be moved to Law and Order wing or Crime Branch.\n\nMr. Saravanan had a passion for investigation ever since he joined the police force in 1997 as a constable after completing his graduation at Sethupathy Government Arts College here. Later, he got directly recruited as SI and served in Sivaganga district before joining SB CID wing.\n\nThanks to the encouragement of Mr. Mariappan, he had helped the local police in cracking a couple of murder cases after tracing mobile call details and mounting technical surveillance. He focused on the use of scientific aids in investigations at the All-India Police Duty Meet, he added.",
