The Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Service (TNFRS) personnel put out the fire in over three hours.\n\nAccording to TNFRS officials, the fire was reported around 3.30 a.m at Talent Maximum, which is situated on the second floor of the four-storied building. Seven fire tenders and three Metrowater lorries were deployed.\n\n\u201cThe security guard spotted smoke and went into the office. Upon seeing the air-conditioner on fire, he tried to put it off using an extinguisher. He doused the flames initially, but failed to wait and see if it was fully extinguished. When he closed the door and walked out, the fire spread. Then, he alerted us,\u201d said a fire officer.\n\n\u201cWe suspect the loss to run to lakhs of rupees,\u201d said a TNFRS officer. The fire was put out around 6.30 a.m.",
