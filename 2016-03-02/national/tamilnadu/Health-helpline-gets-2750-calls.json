Prabhudoss, head, marketing and hospital relations, GVK EMRI, which runs the State helpline, close to 2,750 calls have been received.\n\nA majority of the calls \u2014 over 1,600 have been from students, while teachers have made 269 calls, he said. About 800 of the calls were about diet and sleep patterns \u2014 what to eat and how much to sleep during the exams, while other calls pertained to strengthening memory, allaying anxiety, dealing with a sense of inferiority, comparisons and family situations.\n\n\u201cWe talk to them about the importance of repetition, tell them that anxiety is normal and teach them deep breathing techniques,\u201d said Mr. Elayaraja at the helpline.\n\nThe helpline began its counselling services on January 7, with preparatory counselling for the exams and is now in its second phase. The final phase will be during the results.\n\nAt Sneha, which runs the suicide prevention helpline (044- 24640050/60), while there has been no spike in calls so far, the centre is gearing up for the results, said its founder Lakshmi Vijayakumar.",
