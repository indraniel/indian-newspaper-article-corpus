    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Tuesday demanded an inquiry into what he had called irregularities in the agreement between Tamil Nadu government and Adani group to set up a solar plant.\n\nRecalling the letter of Adani group\u2019s lawyer Kabilan Manoharan that the company had indulged in several irregularities in purchasing the land and the order obtained by the company against the lawyer, Mr. Karunanidhi said the development had exposed the nexus between the AIADMK government and the company.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi said Justice K.K. Sasidharan of the Madras High Court had made clear observations while restraining Mr Kabilan from making any disclosure. \u201cIt is clear that the project has been awarded to the Adani group without following proper tender procedures. Everyone expects an inquiry into the issue,\u201d he said.",
