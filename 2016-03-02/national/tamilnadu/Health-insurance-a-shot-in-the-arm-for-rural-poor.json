For citizens above the age of 60, the amount will get topped-up by Rs. 30,000.\n\nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday also announced that another 3,000 Jan Aushadi shops would be set up to make available quality medicines at affordable rates. While the State already has an improved health insurance scheme in place, the generic medicines could make a large difference, price wise.\n\nTamil Nadu\u2019s insurance scheme covers a large swathe of population, including senior citizens. A scheme introduced by the DMK government in 2007 was enhanced by the current AIADMK government. S.M. Chellasamy, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Elders\u2019 Welfare Association said, \u201cThe scheme has benefited pensioners too. We have a cover of Rs. 2 lakh with a monthly contribution of Rs. 150.\u201d Mr. Jaitley also announced the setting up of a National Dialysis Services Programme to benefit 2.2 lakh people currently on dialysis. With only 4,950 dialysis centres, largely in private sector and concentrated in major towns, the demand for dialysis is currently only half-met, he said. \u201cEven in government hospitals, dialysis is offered only on a priority basis. The excise cut on equipment will encourage NGOs and smaller hospitals to set up dialysis units,\u201d said T. Sadagopan, a consumer activist.\n\nDialysis facilities may become more accessible",
