Shaikmohideen\n\nDemanding regular drinking water supply and streetlights in their hamlet, a group of Dalits from Kazhur under Tirumalapuram Kadankulam panchayat submitted a petition to Collector M. Karunakaran on Monday.\n\nThe petitioners said that drinking water supply, which had remained affected for the past one year, was yet to resume despite repeated attempts made by the residents of Kazhur and petitions submitted to the officials concerned.\n\nThe hamlet, housing 50 Dalit families, had been neglected by the officials and the local body administration, they said. \u201cThough we made several attempts during the past one year to meet the panchayat president, Ramesh, all our efforts went in vain. Hence, the Collector should instruct the officials concerned to provide basic facilities to the village,\u201d said M. Eranian of Kazhur.",
