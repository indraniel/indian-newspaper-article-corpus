After the representatives of the agency and Hospital Superintendent held talks with them and assured them that salaries would be credited into their accounts by evening, they withdrew the stir.\n\nHowever, the salaries were not credited into their accounts till late on Tuesday evening, Sanjay Babu, one of the workers who led the protest, said. They again spoke to them and assured the protesters that they would receive their salaries by Wednesday noon, he said.\n\nThey resumed work immediately after the agency and hospital authorities gave them assurance, he said adding they would decide the further course of action after waiting for a day on Wednesday. The agency paid monthly salary of about Rs. 9,000 to Rs. 10,000 to a worker, he said.\n\nThough the agency deducted about Rs. 1,000 towards insurance and Provident Fund from each worker\u2019s salary there were no proper records to prove the genuineness, he said.",
