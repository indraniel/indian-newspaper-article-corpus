An alert has been sounded at all the airports and railway stations, claim police officers. According to the police, on Monday morning, Irimia Ionut (33) from Romania and one of his friends went to Canara Bank ATM inside a petrol bunk in Guindy on Anna Salai.\n\n\u201cIrimia Ionut walked in around 6.30 a.m. and fixed the skimmer and a pinhole camera on the ATM machine,\u201d said D. Kannan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar.\n\nIn the afternoon, the staff of the bank had come to the ATM to fill in money and noticed something unusual. \u201cThey saw the skimmer and the camera and informed the police. We rushed to the place and checked the CCTV footage and identified the foreigner,\u201d added the officer.\n\nPlainclothes policemen were deployed at the bunk. Around 7.30 p.m., Ionut and his friend reached the ATM to collect the skimmer. \u201cWe identified them, but they began to flee. We chased the two, but were able to nab only one of them,\u201d added Mr. Kannan. The police took him to Rajam Sea View Apartment, in VGP Layout, Uthandi, where he and two of his friends were staying. But the other two had escaped, the officer said.\n\n\u201cWe took the passport copy he had submitted at the place he was staying at and found the three had come on a tourist visa on February 25,\u201d added the officer.\n\nThe police, who are finding it difficult to understand what the man is speaking, said he was not able to get any details of the customers.\n\nThe petrol bunk employees remember seeing the foreigner.\n\n\u201cHe was bulky and had tattoos on his legs. I vaguely remember his friend and guess he was waiting for him with a bike outside the bunk,\u201d said one of the staff there. Others said that there had never been a security guard at this ATM, despite it being frequently used. A police officer confirmed there was no guard.\n\nP.N.A. Shankar, joint secretary, Cyber Society of India, said that though people were becoming more aware of skimming, the banks should ensure that a security guard is posted inside the ATM room.\n\nThe police say they chased two foreigners from the petrol bunk but were able to nab only one",
