The facility, established at a cost of Rs 34.39 lakh under Pudu Vazhvu Thittam, was inaugurated by Collector M. Ravikumar at the garment park building in Puthiyamputhur. The centre has been equipped with ten power sewing machines, embroidery machines, zig zag stitching machines and other necessary tools. More importantly, design software had been created to add style to any outfit, sources told The Hindu . This facility would ensure livelihood support for people of Puthiyamputhur and surrounding villages, the Collector said. Around 6,000 families from villages around Ottapidaram, Ottanatham, Pasuvanthanai and Kurukusalai would benefit from this centre. Using modern machinery and technology, around 300 shirts, 250 churidhars and 300 nighties could be made in a day at the centre. Mr. Ravikumar said required training would be offered by experts to members of women self-help groups. T. Manohar, president, Clothes and Readymade Garment Traders\u2019 Association, Puthiyamputhur, hailed the facility saying that trade opportunities would go up following the opening of the centre . However, he felt that more bus services should be introduced between Puthiyamputhur and Tirunelveli, from where a majority of the workforce commuted for work.",
