Ganesan\n\nCampaigning for land rights for the marginalised sections of society, people from various parts of Tamil Nadu participated in a demonstration organised by Unorganised Workers Federation and National Alliance for People\u2019s Movements, on Tuesday. This was the concluding event of their \u2018Land Rights Yatra\u2019.\n\nThe yatra, which began in Tuticorin on February 21, focusses on issues relating to land grabbing in coastal areas and tribal rights on forest lands.\n\n\u201cIn Tuticorin, the focus was on salt pan workers and how they are being paid poorly while the lands they are working on are leased by their owners. The majority of the land in the state is locked up with the rich and none of it is with the poor who need it,\u201d said R. Geetha, advisor to the UWF.\n\nParticipants presented a land rights charter which had been drafted after detailed interactions with the people belonging to the marginalised sections. This was presented to the Collectors of Tuticorin, Tiruvannamalai, Erode, Krishnagiri, Vellore and Dindigul districts.\n\n\u201cEven in urban centres in Chennai and Tiruchi, lands meant for affordable housing are not used. Even after the floods in Chennai, families living in slums are being targeted and forced to shift to tenements, while blatant encroachments along Adyar are being ignored,\u201d she added.",
