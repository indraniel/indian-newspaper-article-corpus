    "text": "After Ghat Road from Mullukurichi to Kolli Hills was thrown opened for public recently, two bus services were introduced between Attur and Kolli Hills here on Monday.\n\nPresently, to reach Kolli Hills, tribals and tourists have to reach Karavalli in the foothills, near Sendamangalam, and take up the 22 km Ghat Road that has 70 hairpin bends. There has been a long demand from tribals for an alternative road from the hilltop to reach Thammampatti so that they could market their products.\n\nHence, a project for laying roads for 7.50 km from Nariankadu to Mullukurichi was taken up in 2010 and completed recently.\n\nMinister for Industries and Transport P. Thangamani flagged off the serviceThe bus services would be operated in Attur \u2013Nariankadu \u2013 Mullukurichi \u2013 Kolli Hills route.",
