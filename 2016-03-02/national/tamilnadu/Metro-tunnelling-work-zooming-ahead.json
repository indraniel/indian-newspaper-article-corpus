Tunnelling work between Thirumangalam and Nehru Park was completed recently.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we have to finish signalling and electrification work. First, trial runs with only the loco will be done. Later, trial runs of the trains will be carried out,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe construction of stations along this stretch was also progressing fast and mechanical, electrical and plumbing works were currently on, he said.\n\nThough they wanted to extend the commissioning till Egmore, it was not possible as there was plenty of work left to be completed, sources said.\n\nChennai Metro Rail, built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, extends to over 45 km. Of this, the first service between Koyambedu to Alandur, a distance of 10 km, was launched only in July last.\n\nSo far, nine trains are running between Koyambedu and Alandur.\n\nA total of 42 trains will be put to use and 33 will be from SriCity and nine from Sao Paulo.\n\nThe fares for this stretch range between Rs. 10 and Rs. 40 for ordinary class and Rs. 20 and Rs. 80 for the special class.",
