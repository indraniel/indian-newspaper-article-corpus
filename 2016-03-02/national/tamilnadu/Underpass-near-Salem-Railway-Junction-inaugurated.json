Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nA railway underpass near the Salem Railway Junction, constructed at an outlay of Rs. 23.32 crore, was declared open by the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa through video-conferencing on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the State Government spent Rs. 17.50 crore for the project, the Railways spent the rest of the amount as its share.\n\nThe underpass will connect the Junction area with the Old Suramangalam and the surrounding areas. The new facility has replaced manned level crossing.\n\nWith all the long distance trains proceeding towards Chennai, Bengaluru and also to Mettur Dam passing via this point every now and then, the manned level crossing remained closed for a major part.\n\nAs the people preferred to cross the track risking their lives even when the gate is closed, the Railways sanctioned the underpass.\n\nThe railway portion works were completed more than a year ago.\n\nThe State Highways Department was entrusted with the work of laying the connecting roads on both sides of the new facility.\n\nThe underpass has provided easy access from the Junction area to the areas such as Old Suramangalam, Bodinayakkanpatti, Selathanapatti and Reddipatti situated on the other side of the Railway Junction.\n\nThe new facility will enable the Railways to plan for a second entry to Junction at Old Suramangalam, which will immensely reduce congestion at the main entrance.\n\nMayor S. Soundappan, G. Venkatachalam, MLA, and others were present at the venue.",
