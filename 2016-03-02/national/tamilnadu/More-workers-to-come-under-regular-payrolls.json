Dhananjayan, an industry consultant and chartered accountant.\n\nNow, many employees too did not want to be in the regular payroll as they were not willing to pay the EPF contribution from their meagre salaries.\n\nBurden\n\nSo, many employers too did not want to bear the burden of paying that share towards the EPF from their resources.\n\nThe new proposal is going to change the situation and it would be helping the employers too in a significant way.\n\n\u201cOnly if we bring the employees into regular payroll, such strength can be shown to the foreign buyers who usually look for the employee strength in the \u2018regular payroll\u2019 to assess whether adequate workforce is available with us to execute a particular order in time or not. At the same time, the workers who usually move from one unit to another too will show the inclination to join the EPF scheme,\u201d said Raja M. Shanmugam, an apparel exporter and state council member of Confederation of Indian Industry.",
