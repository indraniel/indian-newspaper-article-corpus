It was a display of stamina and skill. Bharathiar\u2019s Sivasakthi Koothu \u201cThaga Thaga Thaga Endru\u2026\" in Ragam Siva Sakthi and Thalam Adi was a vigorous performance. Before the thillana in Mand by Lalgudi Jayaraman in the name of \u201cDevi\u201d, they also danced for a song from the famous \u201cThevaram\u201d \u201cMathar Piraikanniyane\u201d.\n\nThe song selections and the synchronization to music were enjoyed well by the audience.\n\nThe prime time was a Pattimandram, where the two great epics, Ramayana or Mahabharata, explained the ethical codes of life better.\n\nProfessors T.K. Subramaniyam, Visalakshi Subramaniyan and Rajkumar were pitted against professors Rajaram, R. Soundaravalli and R. Madu, with professor S.S.M. Sundaram as the judge.\n\nThe speakers made erudite references, which were very informative to the audience. The speakers on both sides gave extensive references to the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.\n\nThe judge while delivering his judgement said that Mahabharata being a complex epic showed the interaction between extraordinary characters, such as Bhishma and Karna and therefore had more lessons for humanity than the Ramayana.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
