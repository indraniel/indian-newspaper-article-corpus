    "text": "When S. Sembaruthi (16), a class 10 student of the Government High School in Thungapuram, blocked the car of Kunnam MLA S.S. Sivasankar in 2013 to impress upon the need of reopening the part-time library at Kolappadi in Veppur Union, she would not have imaged that she would reopen the library one day.\n\nContrary to the popular perception, the girl, who was instrumental in taking the matter to the elected representative, was made as the chief guest of the function and declared open the new library building constructed at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh under the MLA\u2019s Local Area Development Fund. Moreover, Sembaruthi finds her name on the plaque even before she appears for the SSLC examinations.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to receive a petition from a girl studying in class 8. It is because of her, the tiny village has got a library. We made her to open it in order to motivate her,\u201d Mr. Sivasankar told The Hindu .\n\nAccording to the rule, funds could not be allocated to construct building for branch library.\n\nHowever, Mr. Sivasankar took up the matter to the authorities and allocated funds for constructing library (full time) basically to fulfil her wish in the overall interest of schoolchildren and others of the village.\n\nThanks and a vow\n\nMs. Sembaruthi, who was asked to deliver inaugural address at the function held in her village, did not fail to thank the MLA and organisers for giving her the opportunity. She vowed to become an IPS officer.",
