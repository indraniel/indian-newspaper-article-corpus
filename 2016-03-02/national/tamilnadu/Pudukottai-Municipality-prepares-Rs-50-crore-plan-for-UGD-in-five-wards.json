The municipality had prepared the scheme for the second phase of the facility.\n\nThe wards which would be covered are 1, 2, 3, and 41 and 42 which have a population of 30,000. Previously, these wards were attached to the Pudukottai village panchayat.\n\nAccording to R. Rajasekar, Municipal Chairman, the proposal had been sent to the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, the implementing agency. The sewage treatment plant would handle five million litres per day (mld). The cumulative length of sewage pipelines would be 74 km and 3,400 manholes would be set up.\n\nJeeva Subramanian, Municipal Commissioner, said the estimate for the underground drainage facility included total renovation and strengthening of the previous panchayat roads. \u201cThese roads needed total re-laying and about Rs. 15 crore had been allocated for the strengthening and laying of new roads all across these five wards,\u201d he said.\n\nThe facility had been designed for meeting the population requirement till the year 2040.",
