Bashkaran\n\nAs the Assembly election schedule is likely to be announced anytime, a poster war has already began here in the district.\n\nRoad medians, government buildings, trees and lamp posts lend a perfect campaign for the cadre of the major parties, as they draw the battle lines on the streets much before the campaign trail of their star leaders.\n\nOften a campaign trail of the leaders brings out a sea of posters. It is then the street space is littered with sycophantic posters and personality cult based street imageries. However, rules of the game seem to have changed. As if to vouch by the old adage, \u201cout of sight-out of mind\u201d, the party cadre are leaving no space unused.\n\nThe street space continues to hold relevance, even as local cadre seem to have found a campaign space in the virtual world on Whatsapp.Be it a few feet high road medians highway walls, no space is spared. But the poster war is mainly confined to the townscape and appears to have been monopolised by the two key Dravidian parties. As for the other players, the government office buildings may well lend a space and \u201cstick no bills\u201d warnings are no deterrent.",
