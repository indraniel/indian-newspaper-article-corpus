In all, 24 candidates were in the race for the election of Board of Directors held in January under the supervision of a retired High Court judge.\n\nThe elected board members include S Annamalai, P C G Asok Kumar, B Vijayadurai, V. V. D. N. Vikraman, S. R. Aravind Kumar, A. Shidambaranthan, B. S. Keshava Murthy , P. Yesuthasen, Chitra Murali and K Nagarajan.\n\nMr Annamalai told The Hindu , \u201cThe decision on who would be the chairman was not taken. We will decide on that soon. We also have the support of the FIIs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe board would educate shareholders about the necessity to go for an IPO. During the bank\u2019s Annual General Meeting the resolution for IPO got rejected by the shareholders. Mr Vaikundarajan and his team had contended that if the bank went for an IPO the bank would go out of the hands of the Nadar community. \u201cWe required a 75 per cent majority for the IPO and we did not get that. The capital adequacy norms should be strengthened and we will explain this to the shareholders,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Pioneer Group was founded in 1945 with the setting up of Pioneer Match Works at Sivakasi by K.A.A.Sankaralingam and K.A.A.Arunachalam. According to the group\u2019s website it has a turnover of Rs. 750 crore. The new board will be meeting in the next ten days.\n\nChitra Murali is the 94-year-old bank\u2019s first woman director",
