    "text": "TIRUCHI: The IT Park at Navalpattu in the outskirts of the city would soon house a Disaster Recovery Centre (DRC) of the State.\n\nChief Minister Jayalalithaa on Tuesday laid the foundation stone through video conference for the centre to be set up by the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) at an investment of Rs. 53.28 crore.\n\nThe DRC mainly intended to ensure data security and avoid data loss because of man-made or natural disasters. It was expected to become operational in another five to six months.\n\nAt present, the e-governance applications of various State government departments are hosted at the State Data Centre functioning in Chennai. The DRC would be a back up (mirror image) of the State Data Centre and ensure there was no data loss due to natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The DRC\u2019s role would be crucial at such times. For instance, the SDC in Chennai faced outage for a few days during the recent floods. The DRC with replication of content at both the sites would help ensure that there was minimal or no disruption to the e-governance services on such eventualities.\n\nAccording to sources, the centre would be established on an area of about 5,000 square feet at the IT Park.",
