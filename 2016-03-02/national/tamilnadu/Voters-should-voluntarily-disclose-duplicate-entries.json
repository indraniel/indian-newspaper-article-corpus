    "text": "Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni has called upon voters to voluntarily disclose details on duplicate entries and dead persons in their families as the Election Commission is actively removing such entries from the electoral rolls during the ongoing purification drive.\n\n\u201cWe have identified and removed over 6.75 lakh such entries. People should also disclose duplicate entries which would go a long way in purifying the electoral rolls,\u201d Mr. Lakhoni told The Hindu .\n\nThe Commission has taken several initiatives to encourage more voters to cast their votes. The queue position outside a polling booth on the polling day can be obtained from the Election Commission by sending an SMS Q EPIC to \u20181950\u2019.\n\nThe request will be processed by a server which would find out from the latest updates on the number of persons waiting in queue in the polling booth and send the status as a text message. \u201cVoters should have registered their mobile number with the Election Commission to use this facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThis will also be the first time in the State the Commission would be employing the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system.\n\n\u201cThrough VVPAT, the voters would be able to see whether their votes have been accounted to the candidates to whom they intended to vote. In the first phase, we are going to use VVPAT in 17 Assembly constituencies,\u201d he said.",
