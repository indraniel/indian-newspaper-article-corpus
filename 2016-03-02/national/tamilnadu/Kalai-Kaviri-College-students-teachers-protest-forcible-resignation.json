MURALITHARAN\n\nA section of students and teachers of Kalai Kaviri College of Fine Arts here on Tuesday staged a dharna in front of the college, demanding the return of resignation letters of two teachers, who alleged that they were forced to sign the papers.\n\nS. Bhuvaneswari and Y. Sunitha, who were said to have been asked to put in their papers under pressure, and their colleagues and students participated in the protest.\n\nOne of the teachers said an administrator of the college pressured them to resign from their jobs with an ulterior motive of appointing two inexperienced teachers on a regular basis in their place.\n\nThey (Ms. Bhuvaneswari and Ms. Sunitha) had been working in the college for more than 10 years. Pressure was mounted on them following the regularisation of their service by the Bharathidasan University.\n\nThe move would deny them the opportunity to become full-time faculty of the college.\n\nOn information, the police, the revenue, and officials from the office of the Joint Director of Collegiate Education rushed to the spot and held negotiations with the protesters and representatives of the management.\n\nThe protest was withdrawn following the return of resignation letters to the two teachers.",
