    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday ordered production of post-mortem report and all other documents related to the death of remand prisoner M. Senthil, who was reportedly murdered by another prisoner inside the Central Prison here on February 24.\n\nJustice V.S. Ravi directed Madurai City police officials to produce the documents by March 14 since the wife of the deceased, S. Thirukkammal, suspected foul play behind his death and sought a direction to the Home Secretary to order a full-fledged probe into the issue.\n\nIn her affidavit, the widow, also a mother of an 11-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl, said that her husband was arrested by the police around seven months ago in connection with a murder case and since then he had been lodged in the Central Prison here as a remand prisoner.\n\nClaiming that she and her family members were taking steps to get him enlarged on bail, the petitioner said that her cousin received a phone call from a landline number at 1.50 a.m. on February 24 stating that her husband had been admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital here in a serious condition.\n\nEight minutes later, he received another call from the same number and the caller informed that Senthil had died on the way to the hospital.\n\nStating that she and her relatives rushed to the hospital immediately, the petitioner claimed that the police refused to disclose the cause of death.\n\n\u201cAll the above acts raise a strong doubt and suspicion about the death of my husband and I strongly believe that my husband was murdered by the prison authorities,\u201d the petitioner alleged.",
