    "text": "/Traffic congestion leads to fewer man-hours at station site\n\nThe construction of Meenambakkam Metro Rail station has been delayed due to insufficient time for people to work at the site.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the delay in the construction is because they have been struggling to get adequate number of man-hours.\n\n\u201cThis area has heavy traffic congestion and we got permission to work for a fewer number of hours. But we are hoping to finish the work soon,\u201d an official said.\n\nThis is one of the important stations on the stretch and the station completion is crucial since as the CMRL has planned to commission the stretch in six months. Work on other stations on the route is in progress, officials said.\n\nThe trial run of trains on this stretch started in November last but stopped owing to technical issues.",
