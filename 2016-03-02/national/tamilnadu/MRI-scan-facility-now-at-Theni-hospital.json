    "text": "An ultra modern MRI scan commissioned at a cost of Rs.7 crore, in Theni Government Medical College Hospital in Andipatti will offer advanced medical care not only to people in remote villages of Theni district but also people in Idukki district in Kerala.\n\nFunctioning with German technology, the images would be of high quality and even minute parts of the brain could be viewed clearly.\n\nHead to toe can be scanned with this equipment and it would be a great boon to the rural people as Theni government medical college hospital would charge much less than the charges collected by private hospitals, said the College Dean, T. Thiruvanukkarasu.\n\nThe centre began functioning immediately after the formal inaugural session. From now on, patients would not be referred to Madurai for MRI scan, he added.\n\nThe patients had been depending on private scan centre in the district so far for getting the MRI scan done.\n\nFor people of Kerala\n\nIt would benefit people of Kerala also as they have to travel up to Kottayam GH for a MRI scan.\n\nChief Minister J. Jayalalithaa inaugurated the MRI scan centre in the medical college hospital through videoconferencing on Tuesday.",
