    "text": "The Election Commission on Tuesday assured the Madras High Court that it will issue an advisory to all parties to avoid use of plastic and polythene for posters and banners during campaign.\n\nThe EC made the submission on a Public Interest Litigation petition (PIL) moved by advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam objecting the use of waste plastic for making political flags and banners.\n\nWhen the plea came up for hearing before the First Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh, the Additional Solicitor General submitted that the Election Commission has issued advisory from time to time and the last one being on March 16, 2006 on the use of plastic during election campaign. It assured that similar advisory will be issued during the upcoming elections.\n\nWhereas, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) submitted that it would like to file a detailed reply on the issue through an affidavit and sought time for filing the report. Admitting the request, the Bench posted the PIL to March 14 for further hearing.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, Assembly polls are round the corner and political parties were \u201cas usual\u201d going to pollute by the \u201creckless\u201d use of tonnes of cheap and non-biodegradable flags and banners made of plastic, which could be more than 500 tonnes.\n\nReferring to his representation seeking to ban the usage of plastic bags and harmful chemicals by parties and candidates in the coming polls, he claimed there was no action by the authorities concerned.",
