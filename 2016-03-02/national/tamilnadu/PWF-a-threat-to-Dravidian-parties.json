Thirumavalavan said on Tuesday.\n\nAddressing a campaign meeting at Avadi, the former MP said most commentators said that the indecision on part of the DMDK was the reason for the existing deadlock. However, it was the formation of the PWF that rattled the Dravidian parties. Mr. Vijayakant has put the DMK in an agonising state by keeping his options open. Only the PWF has been able to form an alliance successfully. We have emerged as a credible threat to the major parties in Tamil Nadu,\u201d he said.\n\nCPI (M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan said it was indeed true that the Left had aligned with the AIADMK and DMK in the past. While it tried its best to reform these parties, there was no change in their functioning. \u201cWe then decided that there has to be an alliance for the people. This was our intention when we formed this alliance,\u201d he added. MDMK general secretary Vaiko said the two Dravidian parties were experts in misleading the people of Tamil Nadu.\n\nCPI leader R. Mutharasan spoke.",
