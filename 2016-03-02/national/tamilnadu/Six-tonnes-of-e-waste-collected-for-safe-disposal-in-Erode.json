    "text": "Teaming up with the Young Indians of Confederation of Indian Industry, Erode Zone, the Olirum Erodu Foundation (OEF), an organisation working for transforming the face of the city, has collected 6,000 kg of electronic waste since June last year.\n\nStudents of six schools were instrumental in collecting and depositing half-a-tonne of e-waste for safe disposal. The momentum for the task was created by District Collector S. Prabakar in the backdrop of improper disposal of e-waste resulting in air, land and water pollution.\n\nThis way, the OEF could fulfil the broad objective of creating awareness on the hazardous effects of electronic waste found in offices, homes, schools, institutions, and factories, and the imperative need to transfer the e-waste collected to a Government authorised recycler.\n\nThe OEF could also drive home the message that 99 per cent of the e-waste was either recyclable or reusable, according to OEF functionaries.\n\nThe collected waste materials: UPS, keyboards, monitors, CPU, tape recorder, mouse, car batteries, motherboard, fan, printers, videogames, remote control, mobile batteries, clock, mixer grinder, cell phone, telephone, CDs, chargers, lights, used batteries, television, washing machine, audio and video equipment, refrigerators, air conditioners, electronic toys, cassettes, cables, wires, electric accessories, iron, and induction stoves were sent to a government-authorised recycler. The OEF has decided to sustain the initiative every year.",
