It will cause diarrhoea in the birds, leading to high death rates among the birds. As a precautionary measure, we have been vaccinating the birds against the disease every year during a two week long intensive campaign,\u201d said K. Rajasekaran, joint director of Department of Animal Husbandry, Vellore.\n\nDuring the intensive vaccination campaign, officers and veterinary doctors of the Animal Husbandry department will visit villages to administer the vaccination. \u201cThe vaccination will also be available at the department\u2019s dispensaries in all panchayats every Saturday,\u201d he added.\n\nOfficials have requested farmers rearing poultry birds to utilise this opportunity and approach the camps held at the nearest veterinary dispensaries to get the birds vaccinated to prevent the viral disease.",
