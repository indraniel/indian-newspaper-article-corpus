As they did in the last two days, the City Police detained all the protesting teachers and released them later in the evening.\n\nThe key demands of the teachers included increase in their pay as per the Sixth Pay Commission recommendation on a par with teachers of Central government schools, removal of Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) and restoration of the old pension scheme.\n\nTheir demands also included appointment of a special officer in every high and higher secondary school to execute the 14 welfare schemes of Tamil Nadu government, which included distribution of free laptops, text books and uniforms. JACTTO members said that headmasters and teachers were being utilised for carrying out these welfare schemes, thereby jeopardising the primary duty of teaching.\n\nJACTTO had also demanded regularisation of pay for teachers who were appointed on contractual and consolidated pay basis during 1986-1988 and 2004-2006 respectively.",
