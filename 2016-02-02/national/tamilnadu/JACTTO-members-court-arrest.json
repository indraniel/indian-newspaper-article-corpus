Patrick Raymond said that political parties that wished to have \u201calliance with the JACTTO\u201d alone would win in the Assembly election. The JACTTO had one crore votes. The State government should take efforts to fulfil their demands, he said. The JACTTO members had been pressing the government for the fulfilment of their demands for the past five years. But the government did not even invite the association leaders for talks, he noted.\n\nThe members also demanded pay for primary, graduate and postgraduate teachers on a par with the Central government staff, implementation of old pension scheme and scraping of new pension scheme, and regularisation of pay for teachers who were appointed on contract basis. Appointment of a special officer to implement various welfare schemes, periodical promotion, cancellation of teachers eligibility test and continuation of advance of selection grade and special grade were other demands.\n\nTheni\n\nHundreds of teachers and members of JACTTO staged a demonstration in front of the Collectorate here on Monday morning. A total of 1,371 primary schoolteachers and 588 graduate and postgraduate teachers were absent from work. Government schools were functioning with skeletal staff.\n\nRamanathapuram/Sivaganga\n\nAbout 2,000 members courted arrest, ending their three-day picketing agitations in the two districts.\n\nJACTTO district secretary V Ramamurthy claimed that majority of the government schools remained closed.\n\nOfficial sources, however, said that all the more than 1000 schools remained open and the students were managed by Block Resource Centre teachers, Parents Teachers Association members, anganwadi and noon meal workers. In Sivaganga, more than 700 teachers courted arrest.",
