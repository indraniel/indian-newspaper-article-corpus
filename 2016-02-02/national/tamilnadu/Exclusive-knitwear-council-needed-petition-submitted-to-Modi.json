    "text": "Knitwear exporters have petitioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking creation of a 'Knitwear Trade Development Council' to exclusively deal with matters pertaining to knitwear exports.\n\n\u201cSuch a council, with technical experts as members, is needed to deal with both commerce and monetary issues because the garment exports from the country was remaining stagnant at around 3 per cent for the last many years. This was despite the fact that the country has adequate cultivation of cotton, which is the main raw material for knitwear products,\u201d said Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association president M. P. Muthurathinam.\n\nThe knitwear exporters feel that the issues like fluctuations in Yuan rate, and the competitions from Bangladesh could be overcome only if a well laid out action plan was chalked out.\n\n\u201cThe expertise available with the council will help different stakeholders in the knitwear industry to understand the nuances of the global apparel market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exporters were of the opinion that the recent increase in duty drawback by a miniscule percentage did not help the knitwear industry in any way.",
