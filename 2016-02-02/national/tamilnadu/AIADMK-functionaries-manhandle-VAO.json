    "text": "Tension gripped ward 3 of Dindigul Corporation owing to the unruly behaviour of some All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries who quarrelled with revenue officials over distribution of freebies on Monday.\n\nWhile Chettinaickanpatti Village Administrative Officer Bharathi and village assistants were distributing freebies to beneficiaries in ward 3 in the morning, a group of AIADMK functionaries visited the venue, behaved rudely and quarrelled with them.\n\nImmediately, the officials informed Deputy Tahsildar Meena Devi of the development. Ms. Meena Devi rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile, a section of the party men manhandled Mr. Bharati and used unparliamentary words against the Deputy Tahsildar and other staff. The revenue officials then stopped the distribution of freebies and left the place. They lodged a complaint with Tahsildar Cheliyan. Further investigation is on.",
