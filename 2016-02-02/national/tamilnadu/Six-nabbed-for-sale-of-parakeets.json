    "text": "Arrest of six people by Madurai Forest Division officials on Saturday for possession and sale of parakeets revealed the nexus between the sellers and employees of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC).\n\nThe six were nabbed and four Alexandrine parakeet chicks rescued from them by the officials after a trap was laid based on a tip-off from N. Sadiq Ali of Wildlife and Nature Conservation Trust and a volunteer from TRAFFIC that works to prevent illegal wildlife trade.\n\nDistrict Forest Officer Nihar Ranjan said that officials conducted simultaneous raids in Thoothukudi, where the dealer was residing, and Arappalayam bus stand in Madurai, where the parakeets were brought by a TNSTC bus from Thoothukudi for delivery to forest officials who were pretending as buyers.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ranjan, the sellers were using TNSTC and private buses to deliver parakeets and other exotic birds to buyers from different locations.\n\nForest Department sources said that the sellers used social media and websites to attract potential buyers. Once contact was established and prices were negotiated, the buyer was asked to transfer the money to seller\u2019s bank account. After confirming receipt of money, the seller kept the birds in cardboard boxes and sent them by bus to the buyer\u2019s location. The bus driver\u2019s details were shared with the buyer who could collect the birds from the local bus stand.",
