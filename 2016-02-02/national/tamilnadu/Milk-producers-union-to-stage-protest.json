Krishnan, president of the union said that shortage of veterinary doctors was coming in the way of ensuring quality services. This had increased the workload of the existing staff.\n\nAs many as 25 posts of veterinary doctors and over 40 posts of veterinary assistants with the department of animal husbandry were also vacant.\n\nThe Union has also demanded that the Government should ensure adequate supply of medicines at Veterinary hospitals and impound cattle which have been freely roaming in the municipal areas.",
