It provided breastfeeding rooms for them in all the major bus terminuses and depots across the State.\n\nIn Chennai, breastfeeding rooms were established at 39 bus terminuses. The rooms in 32 of these terminuses are said to be maintained by the Metropolitan Transport Corporation and rooms in the other seven by the Greater Chennai Corporation.\n\nExactly six months on, when The Hindu did a review of this initiative, an interesting fact came to light. Patronage of the rooms located in the big terminuses was high. The rooms in the smaller terminuses attracted fewer people, despite being maintained well.\n\nAt the Mandeveli bus terminus on Monday afternoon, the room for lactating mothers was deserted.\n\nA bus conductor said he had seldom seen the facility being used.\n\n\u201cThere are hardly any takers for such facilities at the stops in Mandeveli, Mogappair and areas which just act as connecting points,\u201d he admitted.\n\nIn contrast, the facility at the CMBT bus terminus at Koyambedu has around 15 women using the facility on a daily basis.\n\nAn official said that it was manned by nurses round the clock.\n\nThere are two huge air-conditioned rooms with seven enclosures in one and eight in the other as well as sofas in each enclosure and curtains.\n\nGlory Rashmi Sundar, one of the commuters who waiting for a cab outside CMBT bus terminus, was happy to use the facility.\n\n\u201cI live abroad and there, we find such facilities at a lot of places, which makes it easier for mothers to nurse their babies. Here, I thought I might have to feed my five-month-old son in the cab, but the vehicle had to be cancelled and I was in a fix. But I was delighted to find that there was a place where I could nurse my baby,\u201d Glory Rashmi said.\n\nMore awareness needed\n\nK. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-FORCES, said that more awareness needed to be created about such facilities at smaller bus terminuses.\n\n\u201cThere are no large boards or signs at these facilities directing women who might want to use them. We had done a study after the launch and had passed on recommendations to the authorities concerned that provisions be made to regulate timings when the facility is kept open and make it compulsory that women workers are present there,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking about the findings of the recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4), which has shown that the number of mothers who continue to breastfeed beyond six months is decreasing, Mr. Shanmugavelayutham said that the increase in the number of such support systems in public places might encourage them to breastfeed their kids for longer.\n\nExtending facility\n\n\u201cWhile the move to introduce these facilities in bus stops is excellent, we are hoping this extends to malls and other public places, including places of worship,\u201d he said, citing the example of the Masaniamman temple in Anamalai, Coimbatore, which is one of the very few places of worship to have such a facility for mothers.\n\nGowri, the mother of a seven-month-old, too said that there was a need to extend this initiative to places of worship where a large number of people congregate. \u201cOn a visit to Thiruverkaadu, we were pleased to use such a facility at the main bus terminus there. Extending it to the temple would be of great help,\u201d she said.",
