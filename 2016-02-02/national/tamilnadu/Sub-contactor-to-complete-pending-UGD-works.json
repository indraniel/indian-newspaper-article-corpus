    "text": "With the Hyderabad-based construction company expressing its inability to complete the Package II underground drainage works, the City Municipal Corporation has permitted the sub-contractor to complete the pending works.\n\nThe Rs. 149.39-crore UGD work was divided into three packages and was being implemented by the corporation for over five years now. While construction of manholes under Package I and Package III was completed, little work was carried under Package II.\n\nA Hyderabad-based company was given the contract in 2010 and over 75 per cent of the work has been completed. However, the contractor recently expressed his inability to complete the work and informed the corporation. As per the contract terms, the sub-contractor can be allowed to complete the pending works. Hence, the corporation after seeking legal opinion decided to allow the sub-contractor to complete the pending works that may not exceed cost of Rs. 8.89 crore. The contractor has also agreed to terms that payment would be directly made by the corporation to the sub-contractor for the pending works.\n\nOfficials said that the sub-contractor has been asked to complete the balance 25 per cent work at the earliest so that roads can be re-laid.\n\nConsidering the urgency in the issue, Mayor S. Soundappan has permitted the corporation to issue order to the sub-contractor and a resolution was also passed in the council meeting held recently. Officials said that after completing the works, the sewage water would be taken to the four treatment plants located at various places in the city and would be processed. Also, roads dug for UGD would be re-laid as funds have been awaited from the government.",
