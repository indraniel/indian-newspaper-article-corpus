    "text": "To make the Coimbatore Corporation Zoo at VOC Park a more visitor-friendly venue, the Corporation has embarked on improving the amenities there.\n\nOfficials said that they were adding a layer of wire mesh to monkeys\u2019 enclosure and that of birds. The existing wire meshes were badly damaged as they were installed several years ago. They were also making the gaps in the mesh smaller to prevent visitors from reaching out to the animals.\n\nLikewise, the net above the birds\u2019 enclosure was also being changed.\n\nAs for the visitors, the Corporation was providing an overhead cover at the drinking water booth and footpath with paver blocks. The existing road was too damaged for a comfortable walk.\n\nThe Corporation had allotted Rs. 19 lakh for the purpose, they said.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of the Corporation Council taking a few decisions to improve the zoo.\n\nIt had decided to rehabilitate domestic animals and birds and send back to forest those animals it treated for injuries.\n\nMayor P. Rajkumar had said that the number of such animals and birds was high and that led to space constraint. The Corporation had also sought sponsorship to take care of the animals and birds. At last count, the zoo had 900 animals/birds.",
