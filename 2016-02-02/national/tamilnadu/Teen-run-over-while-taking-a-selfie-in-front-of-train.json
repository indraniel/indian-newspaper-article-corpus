Dinesh Kumar, a Class XI student of Arignar Anna Government School in Poonamallee, visited the Vandalur zoo with seven of his friends on Sunday. After the visit to the zoo, they left for Vandalur railway station.\n\nWhile walking on the tracks towards the station, Dinesh told his friends that he wanted to take a selfie in front of an approaching train.\n\nMiscalculation\n\nHe was reportedly standing on the track and taking selfies as a Chennai Beach-Chengalpattu suburban train was fast approaching.\n\nHe apparently miscalculated the speed of the train and was not able to jump off the track on time. He was knocked down by the train and died on the spot.\n\nThe EMU motorman informed the Vandalur railway station master about the accident.\n\nEnforcing discipline\n\nBased on the station master\u2019s complaint, the government railway police Tambaram registered a case and removed the body to the Tambaram Taluk Government Hospital in Chromepet for post-mortem examination.\n\nDinesh\u2019s father, Sugumar, works at a private courier office in Poonamallee, railway police officials said.\n\nRailway police officials at Tambaram said they had been enforcing discipline at stations by posting additional personnel.\n\nRailway protection force staff are also being utilised to regulate commuter traffic on train compartments and in stations.\n\nThe class XI student was returning after a visit to Vandalur zoo with his friends",
