The organisation participates in the annual fair held by the European Free Trade Association. For the past two years Co-optex had felt the heat of the recession that had hit the western market.\n\n\u201cOur handloom products are much in demand in these markets. Our clients give us designs based on themes and want us to create products. For every season their demands are different. This year the theme from a UK-based organisation was \u2018Tree of life\u2019,\u201d said an official.\n\nIf the Scandinavian countries have sought greys and black-based table linen then another European country has sought a range of fluorescent colours. A UK-based company has gone in for whites and pastels and fuschia. These products would be available in Co-optex\u2019s showrooms in the city too, said T.N. Venkatesh, managing director. \u201cWe have been getting enquiries from China and Romania too. Since we are able to cater to their seasonal and regional demand, we are sought out,\u201d he said. '\n\nOne company has sent a flower vase with artwork that it wants reproduced on cloth.\n\nCo-optex has hired a designer who qualified from the Ahmedabad-based National Institute of Design to develop these products.\n\nNew products\n\nAmong the new products that have sold well abroad and in North India are the double jacquard honeycomb design bedspreads, throws and quilts. Co-optex has so far bagged around Rs. 1 crore worth of business in its export segment. The organisation has been chosen by the European Free Trade Association countries as its products comply with their norms of environmental standards in terms of dyeing, chemicals, effluents used, discharge of effluents into the ecosystem, non-use of child labour and fair wages to the weavers, Mr. Venkatesh said.",
