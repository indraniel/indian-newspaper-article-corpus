    "text": "The Madras High Court on Monday ordered notice to the CB-CID on an anticipatory bail plea moved by a trustee of SVS Educational and Social Service Trust \u2013 the organisation that runs SVS Medical College of Yoga and Naturopathy where three students were found dead under mysterious circumstance last week. On January 23, three girl students of college reportedly committed suicide by jumping into a farm well over alleged harassment by the management demanding \u2018exorbitant\u2019 fees. Three persons, including the principal of the college, were arrested, and Vasuki Subramanian, Chairman of the college, surrendered recently in connection with a case registered on the deaths. Subsequently, the State government transferred the investigation to the CB-CID police on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Subramanian, one of the trustees, approached the High Court seeking anticipatory bail apprehending arrest. In his petition, Mr. Subramanian submitted that the management has no role in the death of the students. \u201cThere is a longdrawn enmity between the Inspector of Police, Chinna Salem Police Station and myself over a dispute in connection with the land where the college is located, due to which the officer has intentionally dragged the college into the incident,\u201d the petitioner alleged.\n\nSubmitting that he had undergone kidney transplantation recently and is undergoing treatment as an inpatient in a private hospital in Chennai, he sought the court to grant him bail. When the petition came up for hearing Justice K. Kalyanasundaram ordered notice to the CB-CID police and posted the matter to February 3 for further hearing.",
