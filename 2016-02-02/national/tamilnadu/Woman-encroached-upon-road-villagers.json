    "text": "A group of villagers from a few hamlets near Radhapuram submitted a petition to Collector M. Karunakaran on Monday appealing to him to remove encroachment made by a woman nutritious meal scheme organiser on a road used by the villagers for several decades.\n\nThe petitioner villagers from Pettaikulam, Kailasaperi, Mudavankulam and Rammathapuram, who submitted the petition to the Collector during the weekly grievance day meeting, said F. Poomagal of Rammathapuram had encroached upon a road, classified as \u2018Mangammal Salai\u2019 in the revenue records, connecting Kailaasaperi, a Dalit hamlet, with nearby villages.\n\nSince the road, measuring about an acre, had been illegally occupied by Ms. Poomagal, Kailasaperi villagers could not reach the nearby villages via this road and had been forced to use a circuitous route.\n\n\u201cWhen the issue was taken up with the revenue officials, she, after injuring herself, filed a complaint with the police alleging that she was assaulted by those who alerted the officials about the encroachment. Consequently, the whistleblowers kept themselves away from this issue,\u201d said Sivanantha Pandian, one of the petitioners.\n\nThe villagers said the illegal occupancy also had denied over 300 farmers their right to reach their farms via the \u2018Mangammal Salai\u2019 now under encroachment.\n\n\u201cThe Collector should instruct the revenue officials to survey the stretch and render justice to the poor villagers,\u201d said S. Suganthi, an advocate and one of the signatories of the petition.",
