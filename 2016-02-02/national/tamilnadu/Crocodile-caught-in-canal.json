On turning on the flash light of his mobile phone, he saw a six-foot-long crocodile, and alerted the villagers. A few people rushed to the spot, and struggled for two hours to catch. They lifted the reptile that weighed about 70 kg from the water and informed the forest officials. Later, the officials released the crocodile in the Bhavani catchment area.",
