    "text": "A 40-year-old woman, V. Ramalakshmi of Kurichipatti near Keelavalvu, who was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital here with head injuries in the wee hours of Monday, succumbed a few hours later.\n\nThe police said that one P. Rajangam (30) of the same village, had called the 108 ambulance around 1.15 a.m. from M. Malampatti, some 15 km away from Kurichipatti, claiming that the woman, a pillion rider, had fallen from his vehicle.\n\nAfter sending her in the ambulance, he promised to follow the vehicle to the GRH. But he did not reach there.\n\nThe police said that the woman died around 7.40 a.m.\n\nThe deceased is a mother of three grown-up children. Her husband, Vasudevan, is working abroad.\n\nThe children had told the police that she used to go to the farm for irrigating crops in the night. However, they were not aware as to when she had left home on Sunday night.\n\nThe police said the woman was friendly with the man. However, they were perplexed as to why she had gone on the two-wheeler with him to that far a distance in the dead of the night.\n\nThe police were also suspicious about the cause of her head injuries as Rajangam was absconding.\n\nHe had neither informed the villagers about the accident nor visited the woman in the hospital.\n\nKeelavalavu police have registered a case of murder and are on the lookout for the man.",
