What many do attest to is the fact that he had been complaining about constant harassment by a panchayat official and the police.\n\nR. Murugappa of the Social Awareness Society for Youth in Villupuram said that there are at least 750 to 1000 sanitation workers in the district and all are Dalits. They either belong to Arunthatiyar or Paraiyar Community.\n\n\u201cTwo years back, there was an initiative to bring in people from other communities to work as sanitation labourers in three wards owing to shortage of labourers. But, it failed. While the contractors who got the workers were from other communities, the sanitation workers remained Dalits,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the number of death of sanitation workers cleaning septic tanks has been increasing. A worker in the district died due to asphyxiation when he opened a septic tank. There are many villages in the district where the sanitation workers are forced to clean the public toilets with bare hands. \u201cThis is a horrendous practice and needs to be banned.\u201d Mr. Murugappa mentioned that they were going to conduct a public hearing in Delhi next week on the Villupuram Music School reportedly making Dalit students clean toilets. A probe is being conducted by the Social Justice and Human Rights Unit DSP.\n\nIn order to stop this caste-based discrimination and inhuman practices, it is important to implement the Prohibition of Employment of Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013.\n\n\u201cWhatever the reason for the death of a sanitation worker, the inhuman conditions in which they work should be stopped,\u201d he said.",
