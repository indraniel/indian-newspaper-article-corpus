Trials, including testing of new sewerage system, are being undertaken jointly by the Chennai Metrowater and the Avadi municipality.\n\nMunicipal officials said that in the first phase of the project, expected to be inaugurated by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa soon, it will be commissioned in three wards \u2014 1, 2 and 48 \u2014 covering Mittanamalli and Muthapudhupet areas near Indian Air Force (IAF) Station.\n\nThe Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Muthapudhupet has a total capacity to handle only four million litres a day (MLD) of sewage while the second plant in Paruthipattu near Thiruverukadu can treat around 36 MLD, municipal officials told The Hindu.\n\nA total of 35,316 families have so far deposited the fee of Rs.10,000 with the municipality for obtaining household connections.\n\n\u201cAs the first sewage treatment plant (STP) in Muthapudhupet was completed and can handle only a small quantity of waste, we decided to start the project for these wards rather than waiting for the completion of the entire work, which is expected in a few months,\u201d S.M. Nazer, Chairman, Avadi municipality, told The Hindu.\n\nThe work order for the multi-crore project was issued in February 2009. Subsequently, the project dragged for seven years due to land acquisition though many residents paid the initial deposit of Rs. 10,000.\n\nThe plant in Muthapudhupet has a total capacity to handle four MLD of sewage",
