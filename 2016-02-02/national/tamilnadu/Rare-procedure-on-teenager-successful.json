    "text": "When 19-year-old Ezhil of Korukkupet constantly complained of breathlessness and exertion for over a year, her family got her examined in a private hospital.\n\nSince her condition persisted she was referred to Government Stanley Hospital, where cardiologists diagnosed that she was suffering from severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension, a condition which needed an open heart surgery to replace the mitral valve.\n\nBut her parents were worried that the scar could affect her marital life.\n\nThe surgeons here chose a minimally invasive procedure, one that would not leave a scar. The girl underwent the surgery, conducted by a team led by A. Sivaraman, K. Dhamodaran and S. Vasundaran.\n\nAccording to the Dean, Issac Christian Moses the surgery would cost Rs. 3 lakh in a private hospital. The surgery here was performed under the Chief Minister\u2019s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. Ezhil has since been discharged and is leading normal life, doctors added.",
