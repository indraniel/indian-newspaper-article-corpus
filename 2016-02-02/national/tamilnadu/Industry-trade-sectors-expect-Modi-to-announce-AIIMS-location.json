    "text": "The industry and trade community in the region expect Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce the location for establishing the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Tamil Nadu, when he comes to Coimbatore on Tuesday to inaugurate the ESI Medical College. A high-level Central team visited Perundurai in Erode district, Thoppur in Madurai district, Pudukkotai town in Pudukkotai district, Sengipatti in Thanjavur, and Chengalpattu in Kancheepuram district, during April last year, to evaluate the locations.\n\nConfederation of Indian Industry and Indian Medical Association have already made known their wish for establishment of the AIIMS in Perundurai, keeping in view the diseases the work force in the industrialised Western districts is suffering from. Also, there is no Central institution in the Western districts.\n\nThe location is easily accessible to people in Kerala and Karnataka as well. There is sufficient land on IRT Medical College campus. Occurrence of non-communicable diseases, particularly cancer, diabetes and hypertension, is high among the work force in the Western region, according to medical community.\n\nUnlike the other places, politicians in the region have not lobbied for the AIIMS in Perundurai. But, the Centre has to consider the case of Perundurai factoring in the congenial atmosphere in terms of facilities available and road, rail and air connectivity, president of Federation of All Trade and Industries Association N. Sivanesan said.\n\nFarmers\u2019 organisations have been urging the district administration to pursue the project with vigour citing what they termed as the attempts made by a few corporate hospitals to thwart the project, fearing a fall in patronage to private hospitals.",
