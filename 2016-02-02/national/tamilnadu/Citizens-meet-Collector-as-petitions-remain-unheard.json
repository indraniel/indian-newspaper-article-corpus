    "text": "Disturbed over the alleged official apathy to the grievances pertaining to poor infrastructure, residents of Little Flower Nagar in Ward 59 met District Collector on Monday to discuss the matter.\n\nS. Satishkumar, one of the residents, told The Hindu that lack of drainages, absence of tarred roads, inadequate system to clear the garbage, and lethargic supply of drinking water, had already been taken to the notice of the Councillor concerned many times.\n\n\u201cHowever, the problems have not been sorted out by the corporation administration. There are over 100 families residing in the colony. So, we decided to meet the Collector who, now, has promised to look into the complaints immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nThey said that the area had just one bin to collect the garbage. \u201cDrinking water is supplied once a week. The supply given through the public tap has been stopped for quite sometime,\u201d said K. Chithra, another resident.\n\nWhen contacted, P. Vasanthamani, Councillor, said that she herself had given representation to the corporation officials on the need to lay tar roads, and provide drainage.\n\n\u201cI took the issues to the notice of the officials more than six months back. Storm water drain could not be constructed because disposal point was not decided upon,\u201d she said adding that all theser would be sorted out soon.\n\nShe said that steps would be taken to place an additional bin to collect garbage.",
