    "text": "A convict facing a non-bailable arrest warrant (NBW) due to his failure to appear before the trial court on the day of judgement can move an appellate court and get the sentence suspended without surrendering before the trial court, the Madras High Court Bench here has held.\n\nJustice M. Venugopal passed the order while setting aside an order passed by the Principal Sessions Court in Karur on December 1 directing a convict to surrender before a Judicial Magistrate who had issued an NBW after sentencing him to six months of imprisonment in a cheque bounce case.\n\nAllowing a revision petition, he directed the Sessions Judge to rehear the plea for suspension of sentence and said that it would be open to the convict, M. Senthilkumar, to file an application before the Magistrate to either recall or cancel the arrest warrant issued against him.\n\nThe judge pointed out that the revision petitioner had been convicted by the Judicial Magistrate on May 12 and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months under Section 138 (dishonour of cheque for insufficiency of funds) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n\nSince the convict was not present in the court at the time of pronouncing the judgement, the Magistrate issued an NBW and directed the police to execute it in order to secure his presence before the court and make him undergo the sentence imposed for the offence.\n\nThereafter, the convict preferred an appeal before the Sessions Court challenging the validity of his conviction along with a sub-application to suspend the sentence until the disposal of the appeal. The Sessions Judge refused to grant the interim order and hence the present revision.",
