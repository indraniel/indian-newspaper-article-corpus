    "text": "Technology will take the MESSAGE to morenumber of road users\n\nIn January 2013, the city traffic police launched the Coimbatore City Traffic Police website (www.coimbatorecitytrafficpolice.org) that was designed and hosted by a city-based private firm. It helped registered users having smart phones (Android OS) locate roads with traffic snarls and plan their trips accordingly through alternative routes. But, the website is not in use anymore. Road users rely on information publicised by the police in newspapers to know about traffic diversions.\n\nBut, they are in the dark when it comes to sudden traffic congestions on busy roads on weekends or on auspicious days. The only other means is to stay tuned to private radio stations that announce traffic congestion twice an hour during the peak hours.\n\nMost taxi drivers, despite knowing alternative routes to the destination, prefer the regular congested routes as the waiting time goes up while at signals or traffic jams. With the movement of political leaders and campaigns for the Assembly elections set to have an impact on the flow of vehicles on the city roads, motorists feel that the police should come out with better mechanisms to keep the public better informed on traffic congestions.\n\nPublic also suggested replicating the Chennai model where LED boards display the distance to a destination through two different roads and the time it would take, and traffic congestion on a route. While the city police are trying to bring all the signals in the city under single-point surveillance at the police control room at the city police office, it would make it possible to replicate the model and to alert traffic congestions and update time taken to cross that stretch based on the flow of vehicles.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nM.K.
