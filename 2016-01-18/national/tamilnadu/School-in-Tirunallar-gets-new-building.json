    "text": "Construction of a building for the Government Girls\u2019 Higher Secondary School in Tirunallar has been in progress at an estimate of Rs.11 crore.\n\nThe school is housed in an old and own building which is at a stone\u2019s throw from the Sri Dharbaranyeswarar temple, known as Sri Saneeswarar temple.\n\nAs a large number of devotees throng the temple particularly on Saturdays, the Puducherry government decided to use it as a cottage for devotees and, instead, construct a new building for the school.\n\nThe new building, being constructed on a site acquired from a private person, will house 26 classrooms on 5,500 square metres.\n\nIts plinth area will be 2,900 square metres on the ground floor and 2,600 square metres on the first floor.\n\nThe ground-floor has 10 classrooms, office room, headmaster\u2019s room, library, and science laboratories while 16 classrooms are under construction on the first floor.\n\nFurther, a government girls middle school will be built in the second phase of the project.\n\n\u201cAccommodating devotees during the temple festival has been a challenge, particularly during \u201cSani Peyarchi\u201d at this town when thousands of devotees throng the temple,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe work which remained suspended due to heavy rains, has resumed and would be completed as per schedule, the sources said.",
