Kumar\n\nThe musical instruments came in sizes of differing dimensions and produced sounds which varied from the reverberating boom to the tinkling chime.\n\nFor those who had trooped into the Alliance Francaise on Saturday evening, Jean-Jacques Lem\u00eatre, musician and composer of theatre company Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil, Paris, were in for an experience far different from a regular concert.\n\nThe experience was more of a crash course in sound and music. Mr. Lem\u00eatre took the audience through the story of each instrument and the sounds they produce. The bulbul tarang (banjo), pey pok (pipe instrument), harmonica, bass drum, guitar, clarinet, nagara (drum), and even a flute instrument fashioned out of animal femur bone were some of these.\n\nThis is not his first time in Puducherry, and the musician expressed hope he could keep coming back.\n\n\u201cI like performing here!\u201d he said, rather simply.\n\nTo further mix things up, French Consul General Philippe Janvier-Kamiyama proved his musical mettle on the Scottish Bagpipe.\n\nThe event is part of a line-up of programmes celebrating Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil founder Ariane Mnouchkine and her group\u2019s stay in Puducherry.\n\nThe group has seen the successful completion of their mobile theatre school \u2018\u00e9cole nomade\u2019 here. Having travelled to countries like England, Sweden, Afghanistan and Chile, the \u00e9cole nomade, a mobile school of sorts, aims to take the tools of theatre to different places through workshops, in an experience of sharing and learning.\n\nAt present, more than 70 actors and technicians from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil are busy with their workshop, \u2018R\u00e9sidence de cr\u00e9ation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe response to Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil here has been tremendous. Their presence is being felt on a social level as well. They have engaged with a lot of people. This has been among the most ambitious and fulfilling of our projects. We are extremely proud of our capacity as Alliance Francaise to bring people from diverse backgrounds to work together,\u201d said Oliver Litvine, Director of Alliance Francaise.",
