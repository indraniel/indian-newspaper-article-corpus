    "text": "Shocked by media reports of jallikattu taking place in multiple places across Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) is getting ready to take up the violations with the Supreme Court.\n\nA senior official of the AWBI said the conduct of jallikattu was a flagrant violation of the Supreme Court stay on the event.\n\n\u201cThis is in total contempt of the Supreme Court verdict. As per the law, the district administration and police are responsible for implementation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act,\u201d said the official.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court, in the May 2014 judgment banning jallikattu, had clearly said that disciplinary action has to be initiated against officials who fail to implement the law in its true spirit, he pointed out.",
