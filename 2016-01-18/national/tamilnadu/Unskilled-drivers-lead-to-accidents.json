    "text": "A licence should not be the only criteria to employ a bus driver, declares road safety activist K. Kathirmathiyon. \u201cIf a two-wheeler rider errs, he puts his own life in danger. But a bus driver is responsible for the safety of all his passengers and the other vehicle users as well\u201d, he says. Kathirmathiyon says TNSTC should have a selection procedure that tests the applicants in various things before giving them the job.\n\nFormer Deputy Commissioner (Traffic) of the City Police T.K. Rajasekaran says that they have been writing to the TNSTC about poor quality of drivers and sent them a list of drivers involved in recent accidents. \u201cTheir officials told us that political interference is also a determining factor in recruitment,\u201d he says.\n\nTNSTC officials on their part blame RTO officials. \u201cPersons without proper driving training are given heavy vehicle licence and the public transport badge. And we have to recruit drivers from the available lot,\u201d says a senior official.\n\nWhen a bus is involved in an accident, the driver\u2019s licence is suspended and it takes about six months for him to get it back and be back to duty. He does not get a salary in the interim period and a month before he rejoins he has to undergo training on road use, traffic rules, etc.\n\nAccidents also put the transport corporation under pressure as their buses don\u2019t have insurance cover. The TNSTC is forced to pay compensation to the victims and this is not done on time. There are occasions where compensation to the tune of a few crore rupees was not paid for years and dozens of buses were impounded based on court directions.",
