A group of bull owners, who had brought decorated bulls to the village, expressed their disappointment over the Supreme Court ban on Jallikattu .\n\nLater, he tasted the Pongal offered by the villagers and worshipped a bull. \u201cPongal cannot be imagined without Jallikattu.\n\nThe ban on the sport has taken away the fervour, gaiety and colour of the festival. I stand by the Jallikattu enthusiasts,\u201d Mr. Vijay told The Hindu after attending the festival.\n\nHe said the persons with colonial mindset, who could not understand the rich cultural heritage of the country, had misused and misinterpreted the Constitution to ban Jallikattu, which was several hundred years old. It was an attempt to regiment the festivals of India. It could not be allowed.\n\n\u201cWe will struggle and try to convince the court against the stay on Jallikattu,\u201d he said. Mr. Vijay hoped that the Central government would take all possible steps to remove hurdles on the sport soon. He had given a promise to the Jallikattu enthusiasts that the sport would be held soon at Suriyur in Tiruchi district and other parts of Tamil Nadu.\n\nWhen pointed out that the Supreme Court had refused to vacate the stay, he said anything was possible in a democracy with the support of people.",
