Ashok\n\nJallikattu supporters of Alanganallur are likely to surrender their voter identity cards and boycott the ensuing Assembly election in protest against the ban on the sport, on Monday.\n\nThey are likely to hand over the EPICs en masse to Collector L. Subramanian, during a grievances day meeting.\n\nA decision to this effect was taken last week in the village by the Alanganallur Jallikattu Festival Committee after the Supreme Court struck down an executive order of the Union government allowing jallikattu.\n\nThe panel had already decided to boycott the election and no political party or government official would be allowed to take up election related work in their village.\n\nMeanwhile, protests in the village kept the police on their toes on Sunday, the day jallikattu was scheduled to be held in Alanganallur.\n\nHowever, no untoward incident was reported, police said.\n\nAfter a puja at the vadivasal where bulls are let off into the arena during jallikattu, over 2,000 supporters, including women, staged a demonstration.\n\nThey raised slogans against People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals . A section of them took out a protest rally towards Gatekadai where two effigies of PETA were thrown in a graveyard.",
