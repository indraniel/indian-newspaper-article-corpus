In stations like Ashok Nagar, miscreants started stealing accessories in toilets. The maintenance became a challenge,\u201d he said. They have also posted personnel outside the toilets in these stations to ensure there are no thefts, he added.\n\nWhen asked if Rs. 2 had prevented non-commuters from using the washrooms, the official said: \u201cWe no longer see people misusing toilets. We also did not want to overcharge our regular commuters, hence the nominal fee.\u201d",
