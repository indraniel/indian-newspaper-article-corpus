The staff would delay it citing trivial lapses like a spelling mistake. So only after a few months, the case would come up for hearing,\u201d says an advocate requesting anonymity.\n\nA source, who is aware of the numbering process, too confirmed that the procedure was delayed. \u201cSometimes numbering of a case takes even six months. If one is lucky, he can get his case numbered in three to four months,\u201d he alleged.\n\nConsidering that many of the litigants are retired or dismissed personnel they find it difficult to wait for such a long period to even get their cases heard.\n\nAnother challenge litigants face is obtaining the \u201cLeave to Appeal\u201d to move the Supreme Court to challenge an order passed by the AFT here. According to Section 31 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007, it is mandatory that the leave to appeal be obtained from the AFT on the ground that a point of law of general public importance is involved in the decision.\n\n\u201cOnly if the Bench is convinced that the point of law of general public importance is there in the case, will they give leave to appeal. Though some of the other AFT Benches allow leave to appeal readily, the Bench in Chennai insists that an affidavit with the petition be filed as per law,\u201d says another advocate.\n\nA section of ex-servicemen says this clause defeats their right to appeal. \u201cHow can we expect the AFT chairperson or member who dismissed our case to grant us the leave to appeal? The process of appeal must come without caveats,\u201d said an ex-serviceman who lost a case last year.\n\nRetired Madras High Court judge feels that the leave to appeal can be obtained orally. \u201cIt will defeat the very purpose of constituting the AFT if it is made mandatory to get permission to challenge an order. The litigant should be able to move the Supreme Court even with or without the appeal,\u201d he says. Tribunals were only constituted to ease out litigation process and not burden litigants with procedures, contends Mr. Chandru.\n\nCountering the charge, a jurist familiar with the AFT\u2019s functioning says, \u201cThe leave to appeal is made mandatory only to check whether the appeal qualifies for its point of law in the eyes of judiciary. There is nothing wrong in that.\u201d He points out that 98 per cent of the AFT decisions have been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe AFT has also been supporting defence personnel to appear as party-in-person and has also assisted them with financial support for fighting cases with the help of Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority, he claims. \u201cThe only challenge the defence personnel would have while filing an appeal is that they have to go to Delhi,\u201d he adds. The AFT in Chennai has disposed of a 936 cases since October 2009.\n\nRetired Wing Commander U.C. Jha, who authored \u2018Military Justice System in India: An Analysis\u2019, says if the AFT denies the leave, and the case is justified, the Supreme Court would not hesitate in granting such leave.",
