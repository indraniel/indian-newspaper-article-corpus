Explaining the government\u2019s support to small and medium tea growers, Mr. Sankar said that the Chief Minister had increased the price for tea by Rs. 2 per kg and a subsidy of Rs. 17 crore. He pointed out that Rs. 5.46 crore had been set aside for modernising the industry and Rs.15 crore for formation of a consortium. He called for expanding the marketing of value-added tea such as ginger tea and green tea, especially in the backdrop of the fall in prices of tea in the international market.",
