The land use zone for residential areas, commercial and industrial purpose was clearly listed in the plan and permission was given for construction activities accordingly.\n\nHowever, with the expansion of the city and its outskirts, there is much need for infrastructural development. As many as 128 villages were added to the proposed new plan. A Bengaluru-based consultant appointed by Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited is in the process of preparing a master plan and consultative meeting with stakeholders was conducted in the past two years. But residents said that the proposal for infrastructure development in the existing master plan was not implemented.
