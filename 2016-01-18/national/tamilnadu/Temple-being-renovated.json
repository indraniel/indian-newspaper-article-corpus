Maintenance of the Rajagopuram has been taken up early this month. \u201cWe shall use anti-pollution paints for the Rajagopuram as well as other vimanams,\u201d says a source.\n\nThe temple authorities have been paying special attention to the renovation of the \u2018Kanda Sashti yagasalai\u2019 which bore the brunt of a fire accident a couple of years ago. \u201cAll the \u2018vastarams\u2019 and holy cloths kept at the yagasalai mandapam perished,\u201d recall the temple authorities referring to the massive damage caused to the structure.\n\nIn fact, the mandapam remained closed for about a year till the renovation work was taken up. \u201cWe clear the weak stones and replace them with new ones,\u201d explains the official. The work is being executed at an expenditure of Rs.27 lakh. The temple has been sanctioned with a loan of Rs. 15 lakh from the Sri Mathura Kali Amman Temple in Siruvachur in Perambalur district while the balance Rs.12 lakh had been contributed by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department.\n\nWith a view to augmenting revenue for the temple, the authorities have sent a proposal to the government to construct a marriage hall on a sprawling piece of land in front of the temple. Measuring about 0.75 acre, it was used as \u2018gosalai\u2019 and was declared open in 1959. Since it has been in disuse in the absence of animals for the temple, it has been planned to construct a marriage hall at the site, sources said.",
