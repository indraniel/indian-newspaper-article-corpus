The revision process is on now and the draft is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks.\n\nHowever, the land use pattern has changed completely in the LPA area here in the last 20 years. The city has expanded, development in rapid in the fringe areas, there is almost no vacant land in the city limits and even in added areas, 60 per cent of the land is occupied, say officials. Hence, in a month, there are at least 10 applications for conversion of land use classification. Most of these are from agriculture to residential and a handful for industrial use, says an official in the Coimbatore Local Planning Authority. The plan should be revised every five years. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, says the revised plan was almost finalised in 2011. However, with elections in the State then there was delay in approval and the revision process was taken up again.\n\nNow, the draft should be finalised and approved before the elections, he said.",
