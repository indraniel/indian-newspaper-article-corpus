    "text": "For Krishnagiri Municipality, the Master plan, which is a blue print for towns and cities to keep pace with development, was last revised in 2000. The plan for Krishnagiri Municipality has seen only two revisions, says an official source. The first one was in the late 80s, when the bare draft of the master plan that was put into operation at the time of the inception of the Municipality was reworked. About a decade later, the second revision was made in 2000. However, much of changes in land use have taken place since, says the official. Scheme roads are being drafted for a period of three years here in Krishnagiri town. \u201cThe entire town is reserved as commercial, residential, industrial and the development of the town is expected to follow the master plan. But, the master plan that should have been revised by now has not been revised,\u201d says the source.\n\nIn the absence of a revised master plan, clearances are a long due process for the public seeking to take up property development. The department is understaffed, and micro level planning by updating of scheme roads is being down in piece meal manner. This will eventually be incorporated into the master plan as and when it gets drafted, says the source.\n\nHowever, applications for land reclassification are being accepted through the office of Deputy Director of Town and Country Planning for approval. \u201cIt will be incorporated into the master plan, when drafted will project growth for the next decade,\u201d said the official.",
