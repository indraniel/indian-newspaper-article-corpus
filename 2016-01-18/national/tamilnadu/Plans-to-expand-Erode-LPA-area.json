    "text": "The geography of Erode LPA (Local Planning Area) jurisdiction is poised for expansion. As against the areas approved to be covered under the Local Planning Authority in Erode in 2011 that encompassed the entire jurisdiction of the Corporation and a handful of villages in the surroundings, the proposal sent recently for approval by the government includes parts of Perundurai Taluk and Chithode Town Panchayat, according to official sources here. The expanded area has been analysed well for demarcation of commercial, residential and industrial areas, sources said, adding that plans for road alignment would be devised accordingly. Under the first two of the three phases, connectivity has been established between Kokkarayanpettai in neighbouring Namakkal district to Anakkalpalayam along Kangeyam road, touching Karur and Modakurichi roads. The third phase will further link Chennimalai and Perundurai Roads. The two-way ring road already laid from Kokkarayanpettai to Anakkalpalayam is now being expanded as four-lane road under third phase.According to planners, the residential areas will be approved at safe distance from industrial zones.",
