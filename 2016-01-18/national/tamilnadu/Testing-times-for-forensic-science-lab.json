However, the Centre released only Rs.3.5 crore so far due to slow progress in providing the required facilities by the Government.\n\n\u201cThe FSL is an important link in investigation of crimes such as theft, accident and murders. However, the major challenge is the shortage of new technologies and Forensic divisions.\n\nAt present the FSL has only Biology and Serology labs and as many as eight important divisions including DNA, Fingerprint, Chemistry, Documents and Photography have not been established so far,\u201d a senior official on anonymity told The Hindu .\n\nA proposal sent by the Department to the Puducherry Government to expedite the establishment of DNA and Chemistry divisions is gathering dust for the past one year. The Department is pursuing the matter with the authorities.\n\nMajor hurdle\n\nThe major hurdle arises out of a senior official holding additional charge of the post of coordinator in the Forensic Science Development Board headed by the Chief Secretary.\n\nThe official has not been able to do justice to both the departments and the FSL has been getting a raw deal, the official said.\n\nThe FSL requires as many as 27 permanent staff including Joint Director, junior analysts and Finger print experts. But no recruitments have been made and the works are being carried out by personnel engaged on contract basis.\n\nThe FSL doest not have a triangular microscope which is an important part of scientific investigation.\n\nAccording to sources, the FSL receives around 30 cases on an average related to fingerprints, cybercrime and murder.\n\nDue to want of facilities cases that required forensic testing are sent to Chennai and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Hyderabad.\n\nDelay of results\n\nWith both the centre having a backlog of cases there has been a delay before the results are obtained.\n\nThe government has already been approached for development of infrastructure and buildings. Although a site has been allotted for establishment of a two-storey structure for FSL in the campus of the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital at Rs.5 crore the works are yet to commence, an official said.",
