    "text": "Over 95 per cent of children below the age of five were immunised during the first phase of pulse polio campaign for 2016 held on Sunday.\n\nThe campaign will continue for a week, with health workers taking up door-to-door visits on Monday and Tuesday to ensure that all children are vaccinated.\n\nBooths set up exclusively for the campaign in schools and other public places operated between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Sunday. The Health Department will continue to run camps at bus stands and railway stations throughout the week. Though there would be only one camp in the bus stands, satellite teams would be covering each route, a health official said.\n\nThis year, the department has introduced a new strategy using which the vaccine would be provided round the clock at all government health facilities, including primary health centres, till Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, as many as 67.17 lakh children in the State were immunised against a target of 70.65 lakh. Around 43,051 booths were set up across the State.\n\nAccording to the Director of Public Health K. Kolandaisamy, the number of camps set up for immunisation was the same as last year. The campaign was, however, intensified in public places such as beach and zoo.\n\n\u201cAs for not holding the camps at Chennai Corporation offices, he said, \u201cWe have been running the campaign for 20 years and have designated places to hold the camps. We do not dislocate a camp unless the centres where it is usually held are moved. This is a deliberate decision to ensure that people are not confused.\u201d",
