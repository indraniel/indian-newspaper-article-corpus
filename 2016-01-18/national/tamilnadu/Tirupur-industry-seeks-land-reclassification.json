Veluswamy, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Tirupur district council), told The Hindu .\n\nThe entrepreneurs reiterated the need to reclassify agriculture land that was lying unused for very long time for other purposes. N. Shanmugasundaram, an activist and president of Nallur Consumer Welfare Association, said focus is needed to identify parking areas and spaces for public utilities which quite often been forgotten by the city/town planners. Another area of concern, was encroachments on government lands. He cited the recent case in which HR and CE department had obtained further stay on the constructions of a prominent commercial establishment on a temple land in Tirupur South area.",
