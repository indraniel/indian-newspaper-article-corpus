According to sources, Corporation Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan asked officials in charge of the project to ensure it was completed between February 15 and 29. The Corporation\u2019s urgency to complete the project comes in the wake of the State Government pointing out that the Central Government\u2019s flagship scheme had been kept pending since 2007. The Corporation was supposed to have facilitated construction of 2,707 houses in the first phase.",
