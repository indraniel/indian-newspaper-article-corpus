The proposal was sent along with the doubling work of Chengalpattu-Villupuram stretch.\n\nAsked if any deadline was set for completing the project, the official said the Board\u2019s consent was only an initial step. \u201cThere are other issues like floating tenders, identifying land for acquisition and selecting the contractor for the project.\n\nHowever, the Southern Railway has set a tentative deadline of 2017 for completing the project.\n\nThe commissioning of the doubling work from Chengalpattu to Villupuram along with the third line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu will ensure dedicated tracks for operating additional suburban train services between Chengalpattu and Chennai Beach \u2014 which are about 250 a day now. The total project of the doubling between Chengalpattu and Villupuram (103 km) along with the third line project will be executed at an estimated cost of Rs. 951.24 crore.\n\nUnder this almost 83 km of doubling work at a cost of Rs. 663 crore has already been completed.",
