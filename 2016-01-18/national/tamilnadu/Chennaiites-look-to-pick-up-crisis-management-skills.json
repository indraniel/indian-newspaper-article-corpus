A trainer with the organisation said that they expected over 500 volunteers to sign up and said there has been an increased interest among city residents to learn about such procedures following the floods.\n\nWhile this is one such organisation offering such training, S. Shweta, who volunteered with rescue and relief operations during the floods, says she went through a basic course in first aid and read up on disaster management. \u201cWhile many of us were ready to volunteer during the floods, we also realised that it was necessary to have some amount of knowledge and familiarity with what we were getting into as we should not put ourselves or anyone else in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more reliable information\n\nA group of students and research scholars in the city have planned to launch a campaign seeking accurate online information from the Chennai Corporation.\n\nThey say the information currently available only ends up confusing people searching for details.\n\nA few universities have started research work on civic issues in Chennai after the recent floods. The number of visitors logging on Chennai Corporation\u2019s website has increased and many research scholars have started a search for the right kind of information online.\n\nMany of them feel that a lot of key information is missing.\n\nFor instance, the website \u2013www.chennaicorporation. gov.in\u2014 continues to retain the names of senior officers, who have been shifted out of the local body. Researchers, who are working on civic issues, have already reported such issues to officials.\n\nIt was only recently that the Corporation took to social media after a long gap and young researchers are anxious that in the digital era, all information available should be perfect and clear, without giving any room for misleading people, many of whom depend on online sources for nearly everything.\n\n(Reporting by S.
