    "text": "Contract for patchworks awarded; repairs to start tomorrow, says NHAI\n\nFollowing last month\u2019s deluge, motorists using Chennai-Tada Road, a National Highway, have had many grievances.\n\nAnd, they are still complaining about the state of this arterial road, used by thousands of heavy vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe road had required maintenance even before the rains but the water stagnation and heavy vehicle movement have caused it to deteriorate. We are forced to drive extremely slowly and are caught in traffic jams.\n\nLast evening, I was stuck at the Puzhal junction for over an hour. It usually takes me a few minutes to cross this point,\u201d said K. Suresh, a resident of Anna Nagar, who takes the road daily to reach his workplace at Karanodai.\n\nTraffic pile-ups\n\nDuring rush hour, the road witnesses long traffic pile-ups due to potholes.\n\n\u201cThere are potholes at every junction, leading to inordinate delays. Despite the awful road conditions and incomplete bridges, medians and widening work, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) collects toll from motorists. It should be stopped until the road is repaired,\u201d said N. Selvakumar, a resident of Redhills.\n\nSources with the NHAI, which manages the road, said that since the concessionaire had wanted to opt out of the contract, the NHAI was forced to maintain the road.\n\n\u201cThe court had asked that status quo be maintained. We have awarded a short-term contract for patch works and the repairs will start this week positively,\u201d a source further added.",
