Shantha (78) and her friend G. Vanitha (45) who live in one of the houses said they remained indoors for a long time as they did not want to take the risk of coming out of the house. Shantha, a retired Tamil Nadu Agricultural University professor.\u201cI am living here for 10 years. Elephants used to walk through the area once in a while. This is the first time they entered the compound,\u201d she said.
