They complain about the foul odour emanating from this weed.\n\nA cross-section of the tourists and also the local environmental activists demand the district administration to take steps for the removal of water hyacinth from the lake water at regular intervals.\n\nA few of the motor fitted boats were sent to Chennai city in the rescue operations during the recent floods. These boats have suffered damages due to overuse.\n\nThe tourists demand the Tourism Development Corporation to repair and renovate these boats and put them for public use immediately.",
