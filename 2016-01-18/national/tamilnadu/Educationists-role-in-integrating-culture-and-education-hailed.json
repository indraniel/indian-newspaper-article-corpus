Parthasarathy, dean and director of PSBB Group of Schools, was conferred the \u2018Living Legend\u2019 award here on Sunday by PSBB Alumni Association and Rotary Club of Madras T. Nagar.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, she said many students of the school have attained great heights now. But what was more important was that art and culture have become part of teaching and children have taken to music and dance very well, she said.\n\n\u201cMy mother always told me \u2018be true to what you do and children will always be grateful to you\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nDancer Padma Subrahmanyam, who felicitated Mrs. Y.G. Parthasarathy, recollected her decades-long association with the family.\n\nShe noted that Mrs. Y.G. Parthasarathy was the first person to combine education with culture and that is one of her greatest contributions to society.\n\n\u201cI still remember how she completed her doctorate in Vaishnavism at the age of 75. Her husband was in the hospital and she was sitting beside him and writing her thesis to be submitted. She is a very strong woman,\u201d she said.\n\nK. Shivakumar and Mohan Rajan of PSBB Alumni Association were among those who spoke at the function.",
