We start the coaching of the syllabus of class XII when the students are halfway through their class XI. We have different types of teaching aids like projectors to show three dimensional pictures of cylinders and cones and the binding charts which explain the concepts,\u201d he says. In addition, the students take 20 full portion tests, apart from the unit tests which are conducted every week.\n\nSanthosh, a staff at Brilliant Academy says, \u201cWe pay individual attention to every student. Students participate in mind games apart from the regular classes. We approach the concepts with practical methods of teaching. For instance, we dissect the specimen of flowers to teach the internal parts of it.\u201d\n\nA. Ramu of Ram Tuition Centre, Ganapathy says that students usually attend classes for two hours a day on week days and three hours on Sundays and there are extra classes for those who find it difficult to pick up.\n\nThe teachers say that the questions will be set tough this year as everyone scores high in the board examinations and the portions are almost completed in school.",
