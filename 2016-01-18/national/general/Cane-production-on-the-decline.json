The production was 29,746 (in thousand tonne) during 2009-10, 34,252 during 2010-11 and 35,309 during 2011-12.\n\n\u201cThere are various factors for the decline in the sugarcane production. Decline in soil fertility, climate change and the need for high cane yield and sugar recovery varieties and non availability of pure seed are some of the reasons behind the decline in production,\u201d said R.S. Purushothaman, professor and Head of the Sugarcane Research Station.\n\nLabour shortage, escalation in the cost of cultivation and non-adoption of Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative, drip fertigation systems by farmers are also said to be the reasons. As for the diseases, red rot poses a major challenge for the farmers. \u201cCane productivity in the State is dependent on excessive rainfall and drought which appear at regular intervals leading to wide fluctuations in output ,\u201d he added. The Sugarcane Research Station, Cuddalore, has brought out 24 varieties so far to increase the production and sugar recovery.",
