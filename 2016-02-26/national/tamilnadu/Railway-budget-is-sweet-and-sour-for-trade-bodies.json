They have also welcomed the proposal to set up a rail hub for automobile sector in Chennai.\n\nIn a statement, chamber senior president S. Rethinavelu and president N. Jegatheesan said that the Delhi-Chennai dedicated freight corridor proposed in the budget should be extended upto Thoothukudi via Madurai to speed up movement of goods from Thoothukudi port. The chamber also expressed hope that important railway projects such as Villupuram-Dindigul and Madurai-Kanyakumari double line project and the long-awaited Madurai-Bodi gauge conversion projects would be provided with adequate funds for early completion.\n\nHowever, the Maditssia has expressed disappointment over poor allocation for various rail projects in the State.
