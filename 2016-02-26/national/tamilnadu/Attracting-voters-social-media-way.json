Their vibrant posters and memes that have been put out from mid-January have caught the attention of many online users. Their latest poster has gone one step further and has invited voters to send in their own memes, to be featured on awareness posters to be used by the TN CEO on social media.\n\nThe team behind the campaign \u2014 Chennai-based OPN Advertising \u2014 said that they based their campaign on an informal approach to catch the attention of a young demographic. A team of 13 persons has been working on the campaign, which is expected to go on till voting begins.\n\nWhile the first part of their campaign focussed on voter enrolment and verification, there will be a shift to themes such as ethical voting practices after the deadline for enrolment.\n\nAt their office on Wednesday, the team is busy at work, reading responses to the tweets and Facebook posts, and coming up with ideas for the campaign. Previously, the team was behind the 'Whistle Podu\u2019 campaign for the Chennai Super Kings.\n\n\u201cThe Election Commission told us that the lowest number of registrations to the electoral rolls are in the age group between 18 and 25. \u201cFrom cashing in on the popularity of the \u2018Be like Bill\u2019 memes to using Tamil movie references that feature in our latest poster series, we wanted to use pop-culture to speak the language of the youth rather than sound preachy,\u201d explained Bala Manian, strategist, OPN.\n\nSimple and catchy\n\nS. Goutham, a social media user, said that keeping the campaign simple and catchy had worked. \u201cThe poster series drawing references from Shaktimaan and other popular culture that the children of the 1990s can relate to was appreciable given that many of them are now eligible to vote,\u201d he said.\n\nShort videos featuring celebrities will be released within the next few days as part of the awareness campaign, said S. Chokkalingam, Creative Director at OPN. \u201cWe are hoping to look at the sustained campaign from a peer-to-peer perspective and not make it preachy. At the same time, we are focussing on bringing in references to movies and other facets of popular culture which can go beyond the metro demographic alone,\u201d he said.",
