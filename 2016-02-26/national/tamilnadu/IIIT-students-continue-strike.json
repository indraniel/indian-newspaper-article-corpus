VELANKANNI RAJ\n\nThe students of Indian Institute of Information and Technology, who have been staging a protest demanding change of the mentor institution, continued their protest on Thursday despite the indefinite closure of the hostel.\n\nAlmost all students of first year B. Tech, including 12 girls, who came out with their belongings following closure of hostel on Wednesday evening, spent the night on the veranda and corridors of the BIT campus on Tiruchi-Pudukottai road. Many of them slept on the corridors.\n\nThey had been staging a dharna in front of the campus since the dawn of the day on Thursday, demanding the intervention of the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) to change the mentorship of their institute from Anna University to a Central Government institute. They are demanding better infrastructure and faculty members on a par with IIT or NIT.\n\nCarrying placards, the students indulged in sloganeering and sought the intervention of the Union government to break the impasse.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , a student, who is spearheading the agitation, said that they would not give up the strike until the students received order from the Centre on changing the mentorship of IIIT.",
