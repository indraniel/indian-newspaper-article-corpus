Out of the target of 50 MW, 4 MW has been allotted to Southern Railway.\n\nTenders will soon be awarded for the installation of rooftop solar power plants at Chennai Central, Chennai Egmore, Moore Market Complex, Tiruchi and Salem railway stations and buildings at an estimated cost of Rs. 32 crore, railway sources said on Wednesday.\n\nThe solar plants would be installed under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model from investment by developers.\n\nThe railways would enter into a 25-year fixed tariff Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for complete consumption of the power generated. In case, there is a sharp drop in the price of power when compared to the procurement through other sources, the railways would buy back the solar plant.\n\nAccording to a senior railway official, the zone had a potential for solar energy almost all through the year. The power generated would be sufficient to meet electricity requirements at railway stations and buildings.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to commission the plants by the end of this year. Depending on the feasibility, the solar power mission will be extended to Madurai Division. The Integral Coach Factory in Chennai is in the process of installing a 2-MW solar plant,\u201d he said.",
