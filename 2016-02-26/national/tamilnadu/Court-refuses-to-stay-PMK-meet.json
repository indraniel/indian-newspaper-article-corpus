Disposing of a public interest litigation petition seeking to stay the meeting on the apprehension that it could trigger communal tension, the First Bench headed by Chief Justice S K Kaul said the Court would expect the party to \u201cconduct the meeting with all maturity and public responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe petitioner claimed that the party and its cadre would not abide by the conditions and cited the violence that occurred in 2013 soon after the party\u2019s State-level meeting.\n\nIt is better to prevent the meeting than to face the consequences later, the petitioner said and wanted the court to quash the permission granted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vandalur, Kancheepuram .\n\nThe judges, however, said, \u201cWe are of the view that in such matters of law and order, the issue should be left to the police authorities.\u201d\n\nIt is for the authorities to provide requisite conditions and ensure those conditions are adhered to. In fact, in the present case, it is stated that conditions have already been specified. Hence, the meeting cannot be stayed.\n\nIt is better to prevent meeting than to face the consequences later, says the petitioner",
