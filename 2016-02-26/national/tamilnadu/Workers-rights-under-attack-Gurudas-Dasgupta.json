The AITUC was with the Democratic Students\u2019 Union leader Kanhaiah Kumar and also with the students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jadhavpur University.\n\nGeorge Mavrikos, General Secretary, World Federation of Trade Unions, said that the organisation was with the AITUC in protecting workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWe express our solidarity to the struggle of the Indian working class and we fully back the charter of demands for the betterment of the workers lives in India.\u201d\n\nCongratulating the AITUC for its 95 years of struggle for the working class, he said that the trade union had been playing a leading role in forging united struggles and continued to do so against neo-liberal policies. The trade union also correctly analysed the world and the workers\u2019 conditions therein.\n\nThere was an international capitalist crisis that mooted competition among monopolies and forced the implementation of the anti-labour policies. This way the capitalists wanted the workers to pay for the crisis they did not create.\n\nAITUC president Ramendra Kumar criticised the Central Government\u2019s handling of the students issue in JNU. The Government\u2019s handling of the economy had been equally bad. He also accused the Government of curbing workers\u2019 rights.\n\nD. Pandian, Chairman, Reception Committee, said that nationalist and progressive forces had been reduced to a fraction under the communal BJP government. With the Government\u2019s backing, the communal party drew full support and there was free flow of foreign capital.\n\nThe Government in the name of economic reform was attempting to snatch away and nullify the hard won rights of the working class, he added.\n\nLeaders of other trade unions also spoke at the inaugural session.",
