While Chennai ranks 113 among the world\u2019s safest cities, it has been rated the safest Indian city compared to seven other places, including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nHowever, it stands fourth among the seven Indian cities in providing quality living to its residents. Chennai has been ranked the 150{+t}{+h}city globally in quality of living. It is emerging to be one of the cities of choice because of its relatively lower crime rate, less pollution and better education standards.\n\nRuchika Pal, Principal and India practice leader, Global Mobility, Mercer, said: \u201cWe rated Chennai the best city for personal safety based on four parameters \u2014 internal stability, crime rate, law enforcement and relationship with other countries. Unlike other cities, violent processions or terrorism threat is less in Chennai. Police corruption is also seen less compared to other metros, and residents are more law abiding.\u201d\n\nChennai has climbed one step further in providing quality life to its people, compared to last year. Better public transportation with the recent addition of Metro Rail, more international and reputed schools and less traffic congestion, compared to other cities, has raised the quality of living in Chennai.\n\nThe survey is conducted annually to enable government agencies, multinational companies and municipalities to assess factors that can improve quality of living. While the survey provides an understanding for companies on factors that affect employees who are on international assignments, it also helps local bodies to improve and attract investments, Ms. Pal said.",
