    "text": "Of the 627.89 acres to be acquired for expanding the airport and runway, 134.32 acres belong to the Army, Navy and Air Force, and 31.67 acres belong to the State Government.\n\nThe remaining 461.9 acres of private land is owned by more than 4,400 people.\n\nMeetings with land owners of 450.68 acres have been completed and all were a failure. Owners of 80 acres on the north-eastern side of the airport got a stay order from the Madras High Court in September last year against dispossession.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to vacate the stay,\u201d said Mr. Gunasekaran.\n\nEven an agreement has not been reached with the armed forces. It was earlier decided to exchange the land here for land at Manamai village, in Kancheepuram.\n\nThe Public Works Department is said to have completed the valuation of some of the buildings. Surveying works too have almost completed.",
