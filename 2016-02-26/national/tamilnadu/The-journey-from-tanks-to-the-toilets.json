Rohini Ramdas, Additional Collector and Project Officer of District Rural Development Authority (DRDA).\n\nThe documentary highlights the journey of Madurai district towards making it Open Defecation Free (ODF). Of the 420 village panchayats in Madurai district, which include more than 2,000 villages, 70 panchayats have been declared ODF so far while another 30 are expected to join the list in a couple of months.\n\nThough only about 20 per cent of the panchayats were declared ODF, Madurai had been recognised for the considerable progress in a short period, Ms. Rohini said and added that the district was recognised as a torch-bearer in Tamil Nadu and represented the State in a recent conference in New Delhi.\n\nAs Project Officer of DRDA, Ms. Rohini was also invited by Madhya Pradesh government to share the Madurai experience during a training programme for their Collectors earlier this month.",
