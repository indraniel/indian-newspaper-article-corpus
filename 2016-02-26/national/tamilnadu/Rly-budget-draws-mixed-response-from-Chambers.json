    "text": "There was a mixed response to the Railway budget 2016 from Chambers of Commerce and industrialists in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe announcement on establishing the first Rail Auto Hub in the State was particularly hailed by the stakeholders. The Southern India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SICCI) said this attempt to reduce logistics cost is a step in the right direction.\n\nPalani G. Periasamy, president, SICCI, said, \u201cExpanding the freight basket, rationalisation of tariff structure and creating Rail Development Authority are also welcome initiatives.\u201d\n\nHowever, the SICCI feels that the fiscal situation of the railways is not healthy.\n\n\u201cTargets are optimistic and targeting 92 per cent operating ratio will be extremely difficult to achieve unless there is a drastic jump in the railway earnings,\u201d Mr. Periasamy said.\n\nWelcoming the second Railway budget of this government, Sumit Mazumder, president, CII, said, \u201cRailway budget delineates a bold vision and foresight with a strong focus on investment, job creation, safety and security which would help to move our growth closer to our latent potential.\u201d\n\nS.G. Prabhakharan, president, Madras Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said the proposal to have a new freight corridor between Delhi and Chennai is going to open up the market for Tamil Nadu industries and is likely to reduce the transaction cost.\n\n\u201cThe slight disappointment is the non-rationalisation of freight charges and leaving it to the Railway Development Board which is yet to be formed. Given the current economic situation, it would have been better had this been focused now,\u201d he said.\n\nOn behalf of the Tamil Chamber of Commerce, its president Chozha Naachiar Rajasekar said, \u201cThe announcement of logistics parks and warehouses in PPP model is appreciated. But, as usual Tamil Nadu railway projects are not getting importance in the budget.\u201d",
