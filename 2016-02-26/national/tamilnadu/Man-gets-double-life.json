    "text": "The Mahila Court here on Thursday awarded double life to a man from Avudayarpuram near T. Kallupatti, who was accused of sexually abusing a four-year-old boy and murdering him in July 2013.\n\nOn July 22, the son of Kannan, a mason from the same village, went missing. Preliminary enquiry by the T. Kallupatti police, who initially lodged a boy missing case, found that the boy was last seen by the locals with V. Selvam (32), a construction labourer from the same village and a distant relative of Kannan.\n\nBased on the information provided by Selvam during police interrogation, the boy\u2019s body was found buried in a pit near the village the next morning. The police later found out that Selvam had allegedly abducted the boy and abused him sexually, leading to the death of the boy. In a bid to hide his involvement, Selvam allegedly buried the body.\n\nThe missing case was later altered to a case of murder and sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were also invoked against Selvam in the case.\n\nIn the judgement, the court awarded one life sentence for murder and another for offences under the POCSO Act. The court ruled that both the sentences would run concurrently.",
