    "text": "Power production in full swing in the other four units\n\nTransformer replacement work is under way in the fifth unit of Tuticorin Thermal Power Station (TTPS) on Thursday.\n\nTransformer replacement in this coal-based power generation unit was necessitated following a technical snag. A team of technical experts from Tiruchi was involved in the work, which was expected to be over in another three days, sources from TTPS told The Hindu .\n\nThis transformer had been in operation since the commissioning of the fifth unit in 1991. Power generation in the unit, with a production capacity of 210 megawatts, was suspended around 9 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nOnce the work was over, mandatory checks would be carried out before production was started, the sources noted.\n\nHowever, power production was in full swing in the other four units which had a capacity to generate 210 mw each.\n\nUnlike in the other four units, breakdowns were rare in the fifth unit.\n\nReferring to the performance of the unit, sources said that it was functional for 232 consecutive days in 2004 \u2013 the best performance on record among the five units of the TTPS.\n\nIt was in the same year that the fifth unit achieved the highest plant load factor of 104.7 per cent, sources also added.",
