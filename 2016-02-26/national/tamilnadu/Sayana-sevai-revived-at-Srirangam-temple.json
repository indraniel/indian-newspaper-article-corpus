SRINATH\n\nAn ancient ritual which had been discontinued a few hundred years ago has been revived at Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.\n\nThe processional deities of Sri Sayana Perumal and Sri Sayana Thayar are kept at the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Ranganathar and Sri Ranganayaki respectively.\n\nAs per convention, the idol of Sri Sayana Perumal used to be taken to Sri Sayana Thayar sannidhi every night.\n\nAfter preliminary poojai, the idol of Sri Sayana Perumal was kept along side the Sri Sayana Thayar.\n\nThe ritual remained suspended for the past several centuries but devotees have been making a plea for its revival, particularly after the \u2018samprokshanam\u2019 of the temple last year.\n\n\u201cBowing to the wishes of the devotees and adhering to the ancient system established by the Acharyas, we have revived this system with effect from Wednesday night,\u201d says P. Jayaraman, Joint Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department also Executive Officer of the temple.\n\nIt takes about 45 minutes for performing the ritual. It will be performed at night before the closure of the sanctum sanctorum on all days except during special festivals such as \u2018Vaikunta Ekadasi\u2019. The ritual is similar to the \u2018artha jama pujai\u2019 performed at Saivite temples, he added.\n\nThe Viswaroopa Darshanam will be allowed only after Sri Sayana Perumal is brought from the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Thayar early in the morning.",
