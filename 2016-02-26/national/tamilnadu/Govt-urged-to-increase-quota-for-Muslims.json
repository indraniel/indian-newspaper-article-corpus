    "text": "The Popular Front of India has urged the Puducherry government to enhance reservation for Muslims from 2 per cent to 4 per cent and ensure reservation in Group B posts.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Thursday, Mohammed Sheik Ansari, general secretary of the Front, said the government should increase the quota to 4 per cent. The current reservation is not in proportion to the Muslim population, which was 6.1 per cent as per the 2011 census.\n\nThough the government had announced reservation of 2 per cent for Muslims in the Union Territory in 2010, it was confined only to Group C posts and not Group B posts . Reservation should be fair and Muslims be treated on a par with other communities . A level-playing field would be welcome, he said.\n\nMuslims, Mr. Ansari said, were far behind in various fields and the government should increase the reservation for their uplift.\n\nThe government should present a White Paper on the percentage of Muslims in government jobs. The Popular Front of India would take out a rally towards the Assembly on Friday in support of the demands, he said.",
