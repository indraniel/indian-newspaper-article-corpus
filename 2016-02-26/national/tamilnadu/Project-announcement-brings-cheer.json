    "text": "The announcement of Dharmapuri - Morappur railway line project has brought much cheer specifically to the PMK here, considering it has been the long-pitched demand of the party\u2019s high command on all forums.\n\nProtracted struggle\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , ex-MP Senthil said it was a protracted struggle by the party. \u201cDr. Anbumani Ramadoss had met the Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu six times to push for this project, and today a long-cherished dream has come true,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project was included in 2006 budget, but with the rider that the State Government would have to bear 50 percent of the cost, since the project itself was seen to have been beneficial to the people but not profitable to the Railways. At that time, Rs. 150 crore was estimated outlay, of which Rs. 75 crore was to be generated by the State Government.\n\n\u201cThe announcement in the budget is the first concrete step towards the project. The Railways already owns the land, and no acquisition is required. It now only requires the State Government to push for its implementation,\u201d Dr. Senthil said.",
