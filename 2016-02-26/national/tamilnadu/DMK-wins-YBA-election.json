Kundan, secured 956 of the 1,390 votes polled. The results were declared around 11 p.m. on Tuesday amid heavy security.\n\nThe Supreme Court had asked C. Manickam, a former district judge, to hold the election in a free and transparent manner. The case had reached the court due to fighting among the 3,232 members who had grouped into pro-AIADMK and pro-DMK factions.\n\nThe sources said that Mr. Ramachandran\u2019s supporters captured all posts for which elections were held. B. Hariji was elected vice-president, J. Krishnan the secretary, and L. Chandrasekaran the treasurer.",
