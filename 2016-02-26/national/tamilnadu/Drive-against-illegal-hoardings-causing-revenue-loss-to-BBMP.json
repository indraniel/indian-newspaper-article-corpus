But no such notices are being served,\u201d a senior councillor said.\n\nBBMP Commissioner G. Kumar Naik denied the allegations and said that there was panchanama conducted, and penalties will be levied. \u201cThis is an ongoing process. There are vested interests involved trying to scuttle the move,\u201d he said.\n\nBut officials in the BBMP ad department say that often the offenders are given a warning before the survey is conducted the next day, and only a fraction of the illegal hoardings are being recorded.\n\n\u201cIn many cases advertisers are taking them down themselves, taking these ads below the radar,\u201d the advertising department official said.\n\nRashmi Mahesh, Special Commissioner, BBMP, said that even if somebody had taken down a hoarding or an advertisement, they are working to collate data from secondary corroborative data to bring them under the tax net. \u201cMost of the hoardings are illuminated and we are checking the Bescom connection data, which is a confirmation enough to penalise the advertisers.\n\nThere are non-illuminated hoardings which we are trying to identify through property tax records, court cases and other sources,\u201d Ms. Mahesh said adding that it was an ongoing process and expected to lead to results in the coming weeks.\n\nRs 3.96 crore in\n\nad revenue\n\nRecently, Shantala Nagar ward was taken up as a pilot and Rs. 3.96 crore was collected in ad revenue through taxes and fines. This model has yet to be replicated across the city\n\nPast surveys\n\nAt least four surveys were conducted in 2015\n\nSurvey report to Upa Lokayukta: Around 4,000 illegal hoardings\n\nLegal hoardings: 1,902\n\nThe Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force booked 15 cases against illegal advertisers in January 2016",
