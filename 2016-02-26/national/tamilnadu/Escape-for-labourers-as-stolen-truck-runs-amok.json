    "text": "It was a narrow escape for 10 labourers sleeping on the pavement, when a stolen truck filled with 200 empty LPG cylinders, ran amok at Anepalya junction on Hosur road on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the vehicles parked there were not so fortunate. As many as three vehicles were damaged when the man who was trying to flee with the stolen truck lost control and collided with them.\n\nThe incident took place around 11 p.m. on Anepalya 13th cross. The Ashok Nagar traffic police discovered that the lorry was stolen from Krishna Gas Agency in Vannarpet. The driver of the vehicle, identified as Ajith, was trying to escape from the scene of crime following the accident. However, in panic, he tripped and fell down, sustaining some minor injuries. Passers-by chased and caught him and thrashed him before he was handed over to the police. Though the Ashok Nagar traffic police registered a case of rash and negligent driving, it was only upon taking the accused to the gas agency that they discovered that Ajith had stolen the vehicle.\n\nThe Viveknagar police, who have taken him into custody, said that the driver had left the vehicle in the gas agency. Ajith took the lorry with a duplicate key.\n\nHe was unable to control the vehicle as he was allegedly inebriated, the police said, adding that the truck went over the footpath and crashed into the two wheelers. It finally came to a halt, half resting on an autorickshaw with two of its wheels resting in the air.\n\nThe traffic police discovered that the lorry was stolen from Krishna Gas Agency in Vannarpet",
