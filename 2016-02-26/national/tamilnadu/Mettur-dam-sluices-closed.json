    "text": "The sluices of the Stanely Reservoir in Mettur were closed at 6 p.m. on Thursday for the current irrigation season in the Cauvery delta region.\n\nThough it is customary to release water on June 12 every year, it was postponed during the current season owing to poor storage. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ordered the release of water on August 9 last year when the dam had comfortable storage level for raising paddy in about 12 lakh acres. Later water was released from dam on August 20 for raising paddy in about 45,000 acres in the three districts of Salem, Namakkal and Erode. Midway during the Samba and Thaladi season in the delta districts, the level depleted fast causing anxiety to farmers.\n\nHowever, the catchment areas of River Cauvery in Karnataka state received continued downpour in the months of October and November which led to heavy flow of water into Mettur Dam.\n\nSoon the water level crossed 90 feet mark, bringing much relief to the PWD authorities and the farmers. When the government decided to close the dam on January 28 on the assumption that farm activities had come to an end, the farmers sent SOS to the Chief Minister pleading for continuing the release of water in view of the delayed farming in parts of Cauvery delta.\n\nDuring the current crop season, about 112 tmc of water was released from the Dam.",
