    "text": "Bridge operator, who noticed the mishap, immediately alerted the officials\n\nMadurai-Rameswaram Passenger train was held up at Mandapam railway station for about 80 minutes on Tuesday night after a mechanised fishing boat, anchored in the north side sea, moved away as the rope got snapped and rammed into Scherzer\u2019s span of Pamban rail bridge.\n\nThe train, which left Madurai at 6.05 p.m. on Tuesday had reached Mandapam station at 9.05 p.m. when the fishing trawler anchored on the north side of the sea drifted after the rope got snapped and crashed into the span, sources in Railway Protection Force (RPF) said.\n\nThe bridge operator, who noticed the freak mishap, immediately alerted the officials, after which the train was detained at Mandapam station.\n\nThe Senior Section Engineer (SSR) from Pamban and the Seaway SSR from Mandapam inspected the bridge and found that the mishap had not caused any damaged to the bridge or the span.\n\nWhen they gave the clearance, the train was allowed to pass through the bridge after a delay of 80 minutes, the sources said.\n\nThe boat owner had been identified as R. Abson (55) of Thangachimadam.\n\nThe RPF would register a case against him after consulting higher officials, the sources said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Southern Railway Principal Chief Engineer inspected the bridge while travelling on Madurai-Rameswaram Passenger on Wednesday evening. He would travel by road from Rameswaram and inspect the opening of Scherzer\u2019s span on Thursday from the road bridge.\n\nThe inspection was decided one week ago and had nothing to do with the Tuesday night\u2019s mishap, sources added.",
