    "text": "Absence of any announcement in the Railway Budget on the long-awaited proposal for Erode-Palani link has disappointed the travelling public in the district.\n\nThe proposal pending for several years ought to have been given priority. The sidelining of the project despite potential for substantial revenue generation was unfair, C.S. Gowthaman, Member, Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee, said.\n\nThe people in the region feel let down also because there is no announcement on introduction of new trains to Rameshwaram and other southern districts. The long-pending requirement for a new train from Erode to Chennai Egmore via Salem and Attur has also not been considered.\n\nThough Erode station generates the highest revenue, there is no sanction made for the fifth platform.\n\nE.R. Easwaran, Secretary, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi, said the budget was utterly disappointing.\n\nAs always, Tamil Nadu has been sidelined by the ministry despite the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa\u2019s request for attention to newly proposed need-based projects.",
