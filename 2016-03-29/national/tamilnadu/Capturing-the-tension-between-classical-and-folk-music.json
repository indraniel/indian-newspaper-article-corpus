    "text": "There has always been a tension between classical and folk music over the merit of the form. The tension, manifested through the father and son characters, in Bala\u2019s Tharai Thappatai took inspiration from T. Janakiraman\u2019s short story Seithi . Ilayaraja\u2019s music elevates the film to another level.\n\nEven though Ilayaraja has won the 63rd National Film Award for background score, the songs in the films come with the authentic touch of classical and folk music and blurs the line between the two genres. It is Ilayaraja\u2019s 1000th film.\n\nIf folk percussion instruments such as thappu, pampai and urumi, particularly in the theme music evoke primal feelings, two Thiruvachagam hymns \u2014 Paaruruvaga pirappara vendum and Patrilaneynum \u2014 set to the pure carnatic raga of mayamalavagowlai fill the discerning audience with awe.\n\nIlayaraja has used a piece by thavil player Haridwaramangalam A.K. Palnivel to represent the Sami Pulavar, the father character in the film and classical music. Sannasi, the hero, despite a strong footing in classical tradition, chose to perform folk music.\n\nNagaswaram and thavil are used both in classical and folk tradition.",
