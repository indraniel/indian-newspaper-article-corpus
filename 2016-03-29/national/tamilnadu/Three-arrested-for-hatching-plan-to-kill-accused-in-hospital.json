The accused was among those arrested in connection with the murder of a watchman recently.\n\nA few days ago, Govindaraj of Vediyapuram, Ammampettai, near here and who was employed as a night watchman by a clutch of jewellery shops on the Kasukadai Street, was hacked to death by a gang of seven who attempted to loot a shop but their plans were foiled by police personnel who were doing the night rounds. During their attempt to escape, Ramesh of Ennore, Chennai, as well as Mohan and Mohammed Syed were injured and were admitted to the TMCH for treatment.\n\nPolice were providing security to the injured assailants at the ward where they were being treated.\n\nLate on Sunday, police noticed a suspicious looking person standing near the bed of Ramesh and when they sought to question him, he took to heels and the alert police chased them. But the mysterious person ran to an SUV parked in the TMCH complex and the vehicle fled with him. Police sounded an alert throughout the district and the borders were monitored.\n\nMeanwhile, a patrol intercepted the vehicle near the Mullivaikkal Muttram Vilar Road and tried to nab the occupants.\n\nWhile three were caught, five others escaped.\n\nUpon interrogation, it came to light that the secured persons were Maniyarasan (20) of VOC Nagar, Thanjavur, Raja Mohammed (21) of Kattukurichi, Tiruchi, and Ayyappan (21) of Ambai Nagar, Vagaikulam, Tirunelveli.",
