GOVARTHAN\n\nThe Federation of All Trade and Industry Associations (FATIA) urged the District Collector and District Election Officer S. Prabakar on Monday seeking a temporary halt to the spot checks of traders by flying squads to rule out cash possession beyond the level specified by the Election Commission.\n\nSuch checks could be carried out closer to the election date, N. Sivanesan, FATIA president, said. There were difficulties in obtaining supporting documents for withdrawals immediately from the banks. Property registration warrants payment of large amounts of cash.\n\nTextile and turmeric business has been hit due to the Election Commission\u2019s norm on cash possession, and farmers were unable to purchase seeds or sell their cattle and livestock.\n\nMarriage purchases have also been obstructed by the norm, Mr. Sivanesan said.\n\nThe petition called for permitting traders to have cash in their possession to an extent of Rs. 5 lakh.\n\nDiscounts were possible only when commodities were purchased in cash.\n\nThe flying squads, rather than confiscating the money they find in the possession or traders immediately, must check their background and verify their identity cards before proceeding with action. There must also be more clarity on what constitute supporting documents, Mr. Sivanesan said.",
