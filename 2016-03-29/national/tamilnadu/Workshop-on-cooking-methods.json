    "text": "A two-day dietary training on \u201ccooking methods\u201d was organised under the auspices of Hans Roever Krishi Vigyan Kendra here recently. Awareness on the importance of taking vegetables and greens with a focus on retaining its protein and other content was the focus of the workshop. P. Vijayalakshmi, Home Scientist, said that much of the nutrients of the vegetables and greens should be fairly big for cooking as the nutrient loss would be high if sliced into smaller pieces. Vegetables should not be washed after being sliced.\n\nAs part of the programme, a demo on cooking vegetables was conducted at a cluster of villages of Keezha Puliyur, Ezhumur, Perumathur, Sirumathur, Kolapadi, and Pudhu Vettaikudi.",
