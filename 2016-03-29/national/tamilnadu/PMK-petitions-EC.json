Stalin, DMDK founder Vijayakant, and PWF convener Vaiko, alleging that they had committed offences under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. In a petition, PMK president G.K.Mani said there were reports in a section of the media that \u201csome bargaining had taken place between the DMK and DMDK\u201d in the run up to the Assembly election. The DMK had slapped a legal notice on Mr. Vaiko for levelling certain allegations insinuating that the party had tried to lure the DMDK into an alliance through dubious means. \u201cAs per the Representation of the People Act 1951, it is an offence to offer money to get votes and also it is equally an offence to offer money to obtain the alliance of certain political parties,\u201d Mr. Mani said.\n\nWhen contacted CEO Rajesh Lakhoni told The Hindu that the EC would look into the complaint and the merits and demerits of the allegations made and if required proceed legally.\n\nMeet on security\n\nDirector-General of Police Ashok Kumar has convened a meeting of top police officers here on Tuesday to discuss the arrangements for elections and security cover for VVIPs visiting Tamil Nadu for campaigning, sources said.\n\n\u2014 Special Correspondent",
