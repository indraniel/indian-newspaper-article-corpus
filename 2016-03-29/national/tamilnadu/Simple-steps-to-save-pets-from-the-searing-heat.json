Pets too are reeling under the rising temperature.\n\nVeterinarians in the city say pet owners should ensure animals stay well-hydrated through the next few months.\n\n\u201cTry and feed dogs early in the morning and late in the evening. Give them plenty of water and avoid taking them out for walks in the daytime when it is very hot. Do not take them in closed vehicles,\u201d said A. P. Nambi, professor of clinical medicine at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.\n\nNose bleeds and bacterial skin infections are common, said Dr. Nambi, and precautions can be taken to avoid them. \u201cKeep humidity levels high by putting a bowl of water in an air-conditioned room. This helps to ensure the mucous membrane does not become dry,\u201d he said.\n\nLarge breed dogs are also prone to heat strokes Dr. Nambi said. \u201cLaboured breathing, an increased heart rate, no response to external stimuli and vomiting and diarrhoea are some of the symptoms. In this case, rush your pet immediately to a critical care facility,\u201d he said.\n\nKarishma Rajaratnam, co-founder of \u2018The Pound\u2019, a Facebook page dedicated to animal adoptions, rescue and care, cautions owners of pedigree dogs about the weather.\n\n\u201cIt is best that they are given a bald cut by a trained person adept at handling them, as the heat in Chennai is unbearable for most dogs with long hair or fur. Pet owners should also watch out for signs of exhaustion and dehydration and can sponge down their dogs with a wet cloth during the day, if needed, in addition to their regular baths,\u201d she said.\n\nCat owners should ensure their pets are de-wormed regularly as they can be carriers of infections this season, said R. Sokkalingam, veterinary officer, Madras Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This apart, managing ticks is essential, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of cases of pets with ticks. If not managed, the pets can become anaemic and their platelet levels can drop, leading to a nostril bleed. Every time you come back from a walk, check your pet\u2019s feet for ticks and if necessary, medically manage them,\u201d he said.",
