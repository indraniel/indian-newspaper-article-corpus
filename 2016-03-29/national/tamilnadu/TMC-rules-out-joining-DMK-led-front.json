Gnanadesikan on Monday said it may not be possible for the party to co-exist with the Congress in an electoral alliance.\n\n\u201cWhile the leadership will have to decide on these matters, my view is that the TMC cannot co-exist with the Congress,\u201d said the senior leader, considered the number two in the TMC ranks.\n\nThere were reports that the DMK, which has already signed a poll pact with the Congress, was seeking to rope in the TMC as well.\n\nThe ruling AIADMK has not invited the TMC and the latter was yet to respond to an invitation from the People\u2019s Welfare Front to join it. TMC president G.K. Vasan has also not revealed his mind. \u201cYou cannot expect the TMC to discuss every move we make with the media. As far as alliance is concerned, I could assure you we are at it and we are not going to contest the polls alone,\u201d Mr. Gnanadesikan added.\n\nHe pointed out that in 2001 the TMC had concluded its talks with the AIADMK just weeks before the Assembly election. \u201cThe nomination process now starts on April 22. We have enough time to finalise the alliance. This will not affect our campaign,\u201d he asserted.\n\nIt will not be possible to co-exist with the Congress, says TMC leader Gnanadesikan",
