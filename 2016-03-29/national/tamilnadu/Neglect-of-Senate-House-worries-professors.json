Balaji, head of the Department of Archaeology, expressing concern that the building did not possess a fire extinguisher and that it was being used to store exam manuscripts. Several other members also sought details of how the restoration fund was used.\n\nThangam Menon, chairperson of the meeting, said it was used for repair works ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit.\n\nThe \u2018A\u2019 category heritage structure was renovated and reopened in 2006. The proposal to hold Senate meetings was abandoned after members complained of poor acoustics.",
