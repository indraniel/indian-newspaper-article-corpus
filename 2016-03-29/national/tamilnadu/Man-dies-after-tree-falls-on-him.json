He was returning home in his two-wheeler after meeting his friend in Namakkal. While nearing Purasapalayam, a tree branch fell on his head and he sustained serious injuries and died on the spot.\n\nStating that the death occurred due to the lethargies of the Highways Department officials and demanding action against them, local people blocked the road. They also did not allow the police to remove the body.\n\nRevenue Divisional Officer M. Kannan held talks with the people and assured to take action against the officials. Later, the protest was withdrawn. The body was taken to the District Headquarters Government Hospital. Nallipalayam police registered a case and are investigating. The public said that no precautionary measures are in place while felling of trees which pose danger to the life of road users.\n\nPresently, trees along the road were cut for widening of Namakkal \u2013 Tiruchengode Road to four lane at a cost of Rs. 126 crore.",
