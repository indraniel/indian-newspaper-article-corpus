    "text": "Noting that religious institutions perceive that the blessings of god cannot be obtained unless there was a loud noise, the Madras High Court on Monday directed the Director-General of Police (DGP) to carry out inspections in 44 places where it was alleged that cone speakers were used in violation of guidelines creating noise beyond permissible limit.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) moved by S. Kumaravelu to strictly implement the Supreme Court\u2019s directive imposing restrictions on the use of cone speakers.\n\nWhen the PIL came up for hearing the Bench observed that the prayers of all religions were offered for centuries even when electricity did not exist. Recording a letter submitted by the DGP stating that action would be initiated against any violation, the court said more than enough time had lapsed since the apex court gave its order.\n\nThe Bench then posted the PIL to April 28 for further hearing.",
