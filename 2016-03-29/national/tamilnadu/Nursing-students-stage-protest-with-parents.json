    "text": "Around 100 students of a nursing college on Mengles Road here, along with their parents, staged a protest on Monday, in protest against the institution not having obtained mandatory approval from the State government.\n\nAccording to the students, the college told them during admission that it had obtained approval from the Central and state governments and that their degrees were valid to get government jobs. About 180 students study in the college which offers two-year diploma in nursing course and lab technician course. They alleged that the institute did not offer even the stipend offered to them by hospitals during training period.\n\nThe issue came to light when the Department of Health Services released a list of institutions that did not obtain state government\u2019s approval. When contacted, Deputy Director of Health Services M. Ravikala said she had received complaints that the college had collected huge sums of money as fees from the students but did not provide even basic facilities and proper training.\n\nWhile inspecting the institute, it was found that it was not recognised by the State government. The college had been asked to shut down, refund fees and return certificates to the students, she said.",
