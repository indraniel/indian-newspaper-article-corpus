    "text": "Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s nominee for the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency Vanathi Srinivasan said here on Monday that she is not an outsider to the constituency. Addressing reporters at the party office, she said that the \u2018outsider\u2019 tag would in fact apply to most Members of Legislative Assembly as, after victory, they had never visited their constituencies.\n\nShe was aware of the problems of the constituency and was taking steps to reach out to the voters, the first of those would be to launch a portal where people could connect to her to express their grievances and needs. Based on the inputs, she would release a manifesto for the constituency and that would be in addition to the one the party would launch for the entire State.\n\nMs. Srinivasan said that the party would highlight the Narendra Modi government\u2019s schemes for the people and point out how they had not been implemented in the State. For people to enjoy the full fruits of the Central Government\u2019s programmes they would need a BJP government in Tamil Nadu as every paisa the Government spent would reach the people here.\n\nSocial media\n\nShe said that she would tap the power of the social media to strengthen her campaign and work with the youth, who were with the Narendra Modi government.",
