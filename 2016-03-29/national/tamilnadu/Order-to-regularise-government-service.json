    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has directed Regional Manager of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation at Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district to regularise the services of a labourer who had been serving the corporation for the last 21 years.\n\nAllowing a writ petition filed by the loadman, T. Manikandan, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana held that the TNCSC had been \u201cdeliberately dodging\u201d from its duty to regularise the service of the petitioner though similar other employees were regularised in 2001.\n\nStating that employees were entitled to regularisation on completion of 480 days of continuous service in a period of 24 months, the judge directed the Regional Manager to regularise the services of the petitioner also since 2001 and pay him the consequential monetary benefits.",
