    "text": "Huge demand met through power purchase agreements\n\nTamil Nadu residents can be rest assured that this summer, even if it is hot and sweaty, they will not be powerless. A few years ago, the State witnessed power cuts of more than five hours a day.\n\nEven when the demand breached 14,500 mega watt (MW) on February 24 this year, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was able to have streamlined supply without resorting to power cuts.\n\nPower managers pointed out the reason for the \u2018turnaround\u2019 was the capacity addition through power purchase agreements, both long term and short term, for around 3,800 MW.\n\nA senior Tangedco official, comparing consumption between 2011 and 2016, said despite the huge increase in consumption of 30 per cent, from 220-240 million units (MU) to 320 MU (highest consumption of 327.015 MU on March 22 this year), the power utility was able to meet the demand because of capacity addition through power purchase.\n\nThe official said the total installed power capacity, including renewable (wind and solar) and hydro in the State, was around 30,000 MW. Though the renewable energy component, at around 12,000 MW, could be termed as infirm and seasonal, and not counted in the total, Tangedco would be still be able to get a maximum output of 15,500 MW, the official added.\n\nThe official added that power production would reach 17,000 MW once the wind season begins, which is from May to September, and could even touch 18,000 MW if the hydro stations function.\n\nThe hydro stations become functional only during irrigation time when water would be released by the Water Resource Department in July. At present, the power utility has a \u2018cushion\u2019 of around 2,000 MW in the State, he added.",
