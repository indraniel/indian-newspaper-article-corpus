Venkatachalapathy\n\nThey have been fighting for a three-kilometre stretch for 30 years. After all their protests turned futile, villagers of Naickaneri Hill near Ambur came forward to surrender their ration cards and voter identity cards at the Collector\u2019s office on Monday.\n\nThe hill, which is home to 7,500 residents, has been lacking a proper connecting road for three decades. In the absence of a motorable road, villagers find it difficult to access medical facilities, and do not have proper public transport facility. The villagers have staged a number of protests demanding a road, and have also submitted petitions to officials and Ministers.\n\n\u201cNaickaneri is 12 km from Bethlehem in Ambur. The Highways Department has laid more than half of the stretch, and has been taking up regular maintenance and repair work on the stretch. The Forest Department has to lay the remaining three kms that falls in its limit and they have been delaying the work all these years,\u201d K. Sivakumar, panchayat president said.\n\nThe stretch leading up the hill is in a deplorable state, a villager said, adding, \u201cThe stretch is filled with potholes, and residents either walk or use two-wheelers. Even using two-wheelers is difficult in the absence of the road.\u201d\n\nThere is a private bus service but only few trips are operated due to bad road conditions.\n\nVillagers said pregnant women and those in need of emergency medical care were the most affected. \u201cIt is difficult for ambulances to reach the hill. We have to carry the pregnant women and sick persons up to a point. Some persons have lost their lives due to delay in reaching the medical facility. Farmers too find it hard to transport the agricultural produce,\u201d Mr. Sivakumar said.\n\nThere is a government high school on the hill, and children too faced difficulty in travelling up and down the hill to continue their education, he noted. He said the State government has sanctioned around Rs. 90 lakh for the Forest Department to lay the stretch but again, there has been inordinate delay in executing the work.\n\n\u201cThey said the work order has to be issued. Now, officials are saying the work can be taken up only after the elections. So, we wanted to surrender our ration cards and voters identity cards. We have submitted a petition to the Collector seeking immediate steps to lay a road,\u201d he said. The villagers are contemplating to boycott the May 16 Assembly elections if their demand is not met at the earliest.\n\nOfficials of the Forest Department were not available for comment.",
