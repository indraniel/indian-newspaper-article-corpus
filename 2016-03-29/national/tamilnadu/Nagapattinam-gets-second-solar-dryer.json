    "text": "This is the second dryer to be set up in Nagapattinam\n\nBased on the success of the solar dryer set up at Vedaranyam, the Agriculture Engineering Department has set up second solar dryer at a village near Nagapattinam.\n\nThe dryer, set up at Semangalam village at an estimate of Rs. 3.86 lakh, aims at promoting value-addition in copra cultivation. The dryer has been set up with a subsidy of Rs. 1.84 lakh sanctioned by the state government.\n\n\u201cThis is the second dryer to be set up in the district for the benefit of copra cultivators,\u201d says an official source. In the first case, Tirumaraikadu Iyarkai Vivasayigal Sangam Kootamaippu comprising 21 farmers clubs\u2019 involved in producing copra in a cluster of villages near Vedaranyam, has been set up. Under the conventional method, it took about ten days for drying the coconuts. But, the solar dryer not only expedited it in two days but also ensured hygienic handling of the produce.\n\nThe dryer, with a plinth area of 400 square feet, can handle 1,500 coconuts a day which are broken before being arranged in trays at the dryer. \u201cThe dryer maintains a temperature anywhere between 60 and 70 degree Celsius and it is monitored using a sensor,\u201d the source told The Hindu on Sunday.\n\nThe source said that under the conventional method, the copra was damaged because of sudden downpour. But the dryer has relieved them of the additional efforts of protecting the crop from rain. According to Agriculture Engineering Department sources, it has been planned to motivate farmers to utilise the dryer for value-addition in other crops particularly for ripening banana. Being a coastal area, Vedaranyam and surrounding villages were more prone to sharp showers and strong winds.",
