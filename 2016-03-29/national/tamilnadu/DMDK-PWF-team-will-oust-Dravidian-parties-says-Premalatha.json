    "text": "DMDK women\u2019s wing leader Premalatha Vijayakant on Monday attacked the two Dravidian parties at a public meeting here saying Tamil Nadu could be saved only by defeating the AIADMK and DMK in the ensuing Assembly elections.\n\nAt the party\u2019s election manifesto propagation meeting, she alleged that the DMK and the AIADMK together ensured that no alternative emerged to challenge them in the electoral arena over the past six decades to share the spoils of power.\n\nHowever, now the DMDK-PWF alliance had been emerging as a potent combine to oust them from power with the support of the people in the coming Assembly elections, she said.\n\nThe AIADMK regime, she alleged, had let down the Delta farmers badly but heaped cheap self praise on itself as the retriever of State\u2019s rights in the Cauvery river which was not true.",
