A harmonious working inevitably leads to \u2018synergy\u2019, a term often used in the realm of management,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. G. Natchiar, co-founder, Emeritus, Director Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, who was the chief guest, stressed upon the importance of the Vision and Mission of an organisation. Explaining the core aspects of the \u201cAravind Eye Model\u201d, Dr. Natchiar also shared with participants the innovative HR policies of the institution.\n\nShe highlighted the frugal aspect of her organisation which enables it to continue to offer affordable eye care to people of India and bring about harmony in its operations, and how measures to improve the productivity of doctors made the operations cost-effective and a role model for similar healthcare providers in other parts of the world.\n\nB. R. Babu, Secretary Welfare, Government of Puducherry, shared with the participants his experiences of bringing about industrial harmony in public sector undertakings.\n\nUma Prajapati, Director of Upasana: Integral Design, spoke of the inner call of a professional designer and the satisfaction gained when serving the community around a business. She highlighted her singular achievement of creating Tsunamika, a tiny doll, which brought about a positive change in the lives of women affected by the 2004 tsunami.\n\nProf. Sibnath Deb, Prof. of Psychology and Director-in-charge of the Directorate of Distance Education, Pondicherry University, focused on the psychological aspects of inter-personal relationships, while Ganesh Babu, Director of \u201cWinning Minds\u201d, emphasised the importance of harmonising oneself first.",
