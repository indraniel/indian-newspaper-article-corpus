    "text": "Pattali Makkal Katchi leader and chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss wondered on Monday how Vijayakant, DMDK president, who did not even attend Assembly sessions as Leader of the Opposition, could be a chief ministerial candidate.\n\nTalking to reporters here, Dr. Anbumani wanted to know how a person who was not active as Leader of Opposition could function as Chief Minister. He said that the PMK would submit a letter to the Election Commission of India seeking an enquiry into the allegation made by MDMK general secretary Vaiko that the DMK tried to offer Rs.500 crore to Mr. Vijayakant for striking an alliance. If the charge was found to be true, the party guilty of making such an offer should be barred from contesting elections.\n\nAddressing a programme, \u2018Ungal Oor Ungal Maavattam,\u2019 here, the PMK leader said that while other political parties had been highlighting only people\u2019s problems, the PMK had solutions for them.\n\nReferring to problems in Thoothukudi, Dr. Anbumani said that advanced technologies were available to control air pollution caused by thermal power plants. The State government had failed to take measures to prevent flow of excess water from rivers into sea.\n\nThe Tamirabarani, if maintained properly, could help expand the irrigation potential in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts, he said.",
