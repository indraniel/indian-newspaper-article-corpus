    "text": "OPS says Goyal\u2019s allegation that he could not meet CM aimed at achieving political gains\n\nFacing heat from the Opposition over Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s critical remarks about inaccessibility of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the ruling AIADMK on Monday issued a counter statement through Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam.\n\nIn a statement, the senior leader said there was no truth in Mr. Goyal\u2019s statement that he could not meet Ms. Jayalalithaa. It was a baseless allegation aimed at making political gains ahead of the elections.\n\nListing out the number of times the Union Ministers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had met Ms. Jayalalithaa, Mr. Panneerselvam condemned the statement of Mr. Goyal and a similar statement by Union Minister of Roads and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan.\n\n\u201cSuch allegations are being made for political gains as it has become clear that the AIADMK could not be defeated in the Assembly elections,\u201d he said.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. Panneerselvam, who is said to have been sidelined in the party, issued the statement on behalf of the party supremo after DMK president M. Karunanidhi sought a response from Ms. Jayalalithaa on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPeople know well that \u2018Amma\u2019 has been meeting Union Ministers in person and has been writing letters,\u201d he said, listing out the details of each meeting, including those she had with Mr. Modi.\n\nIn December 2015 alone, she had met Mr. Modi, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu and Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathy Raju.\n\n\u2018MPs denied appointment\u2019\n\nOn the contrary, the Centre was not granting appointment to AIADMK MPs with the Prime Minister on the Tamil Nadu fishermen issue and GAIL pipeline issue, Mr. Panneerselvam charged.\n\nBJP\u2019s poll plank\n\nMeanwhile, addressing a press conference here, BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao said the failures of the AIADMK government would be the main poll plank of the BJP.\n\nSince access to the Chief Minister had become difficult, there was stagnation in implementation of schemes, Mr. Rao alleged.\n\n\u201cIf there is no development, peace cannot prevail,\u201d he said, adding that in the last five years, attacks on members of Hindu organisations had gone up.",
