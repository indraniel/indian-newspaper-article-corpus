Actress Ritika Singh, who made her debut with \u2018Irudhi Suttru\u2019, got a \u2018Special Mention\u2019 for her performance as the feisty fisherwoman turning a kick boxer.\n\nMr. Vetrimaaran said, \u201cWe are the happiest with the award given to Kishore as this was the film that he was working on before he passed away and hope that this will bring some solace to his family,\u201d he said. Vetrimaaran\u2019s last film \u2018Aadukalam\u2019, won six national awards at the 58{+t}{+h}National Film Awards.\n\nMr. Samuthirakani said working on the movie was psychologically upsetting and it took a while for him to come out of the experience of acting in the film, which dealt with a disturbing and sensitive subject. \u201cI dedicate my win to Vetrimaaran who was able to mould and guide me as well as encourage spontaneity on the sets,\u201d he said. His character, of a police officer trying to stand up for the right, was described as \u2018tricky\u2019 to pull off by Vetrimaaran.\n\nIn a statement, actor Dhanush, who co- produced Visaranai described the wins as a \u2018triple joy\u2019 and said that he was encouraged to support more such creations which would be accepted by the Tamil audience.\n\nThe movie, partly based on the novel \u2018Lock Up\u2019 by M. Chandrakumar, focuses on the lives of four Tamil labourers in Andhra Pradesh who become a victim of police brutality and end up as scapegoats of a corrupt system.\n\nThe movie was premiered at several international film festivals, including the 72{+n}{+d}Venice Film Festival, before its theatrical release.",
