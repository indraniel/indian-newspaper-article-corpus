    "text": "Poultry farmers should take all precautionary measures, as the temperature was expected to rise, both during day and night in the next four days.\n\nA press release from Agromet Field Unit of Veterinary College and Research Institute and Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai said that the sky will be slightly cloudy and remain dry for the next four days. Maximum and minimum temperature will be around 41 degree Celsius, and 27 degree Celsius respectively. Wind speed will be around 6 km an hour mostly from southeast.\n\nThe release said that the rise in night temperature by one degree Celsius, and the high day time temperature are indicative of peak summer. The weather conditions will cause heat stress and heat stroke in poultry causing mortality, sudden drop in egg production and decreased feed intake. This can be controlled by providing cold drinking water, supplementation of amino acids and oil in feed, supplementation of vitamin C and electrolyte in drinking water. To prevent stress induced immune suppression, vitamin A, E, and C should be added at 5 per cent to 10 per cent above the recommended inclusion level.",
