The ILO convention\u2019s recommendation on decent work for domestic workers aimed at protecting and improving the working conditions of domestic workers worldwide.\n\nShe said that the country accounted for about 50 lakh domestic workers. They were not entitled for benefits such as weekly off, festival leave, medical facility and bonus.\n\nThey do not enjoy any legal protection and are also not covered by the Minimum Wages Act. The government has also not done any survey about them. The governments of Kerala and Gujarat have fixed minimum wages for domestic workers. No minimum wages have been fixed for domestic workers in Tamil Nadu, she said and called upon the state government to fix a minimum wage of Rs. 15,000 per month and maternity assistance of Rs. 60,000 to them.\n\nThe government also take care of the education expenses of the domestic workers.
