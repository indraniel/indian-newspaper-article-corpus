SRINATH\n\nIn a bid to bring the practice of open urination under control, the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation (TCC) on Monday stationed a mobile toilet on Old Goodshed Road.\n\nIn response to a news report published in these columns on Monday, N.S. Prema, who assumed charge as corporation Commissioner recently, visited Old Goodshed Road on Monday to get firsthand information about the menace. She held discussions with the officials on the steps to be taken to prevent peeing in open places.\n\nBased on her instruction, a mobile toilet was immediately brought to Old Goodshed Road so as to enable the local people, shopkeepers, autorickshaw drivers, cab drivers, and passengers to attend their nature\u2019s call.\n\nA few autorickshaw drivers opposed the stationing of mobile toilet on the pretext that it will leave a stench in the vicinity. However, the officials convinced them that it was an effort to prevent open urination in the area. The officials, subsequently, stationed the mobile toilet.\n\nLater, the sanitary workers cleaned the pavements along the compound wall of Holy Cross College for women, which had become an open air toilet for men. The workers sprayed bleaching powder in the area.\n\nMoreover, the officials installed a warning board to inform the public that peeing in the public was an offence and those who violated the rules would be slapped with a fine of Rs.100 for the offence.\n\nA senior official of the corporation said that a civic employee had been posted on Old Goodshed Road. He had been asked to strictly penalise those creating nuisance in the area.\n\nHe would also persuade men to use the mobile toilet.",
