    "text": "Drivers of a leading cab aggregator conducted a meeting in the city on Monday to discuss on the form of protest to resort to show their protest to the aggregator for the increase in the commission that the aggregator deducted from the drivers.\n\nDrivers \u2013 who did not want to be named \u2013 said that the firm increased the commission and tax to 26 per cent last week.\n\n\u201cThe aggregator is also increasing the fleet in a city that has a radius of only 18 km \u2013 according to the company\u2019s norms \u2013 and this is reflecting in a heavy drop in the trips we get,\u201d a driver said. They added that due to this situation they are able to make a mere Rs. 1,000 a day, other than auspicious occasions and weekends when they were making a little more.\n\nFor the above said earning, they said that Rs. 260 was deducted as commission and they had to fill fuel, repay the vehicle dues and maintain it besides managing their family expenditure. Their other grievance was the frequent change in conditions (of payment) to drivers. Drivers claimed that those who raise these grievances with the aggregator were shown the door.\n\nDrivers with the support of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) representatives passed 17 resolutions, which included urging the company to reduce the commission to 10 per cent, freeze the fleet expansion and assure a minimum number of trips a day.\n\nThey also sought reinstatement of the drivers who raised their voice and were removed from the fleet by the aggregator.\n\nThey plan to submit the demands to the District Collector and City Police Commissioner, seeking their intervention to redress their grievances by holding talks with representatives of the firm and the drivers. They have decided to stage protests, if this did not workout. Repeated attempts to reach the persons concerned of the cab aggregator, over phone and by mail, went in vain.",
