    "text": "Apart from pets, stray dogs, cats, cattle on the roads and thousands of birds are also facing the brunt of the scorching heat. Animal welfare groups have urged people to provide water to animals on the streets.\n\nPeople for Cattle in India (PFCI), as part of their Water Bowl Challenge of 2016, has asked people to place water bowls outside their homes.\n\n\u201cAs of now, nearly 200 people have done so. People should ensure that the bowls are clean and not contaminated,\u201d said Arun Prasanna of PFCI.\n\nBlue Cross of India too has been distributing water bowls. Over 900 have been given away so far, said general manager Dawn Williams.\n\n\u201cA lot of people mistakenly believe they have to take water to birds and put bowls on rooftops. The water gets very hot on roofs and birds can\u2019t bathe in it. Just place water bowls under a tree and change the water frequently,\u201d he said.\n\nResidents can also scatter grain for birds and keep leftover food for animals he said. \u201cMonkeys may come too, but don\u2019t pelt stones at them. They too are suffering in the heat,\u201d he said.\n\nResidents can call Blue Cross of India on 044-22354959 if they see an animal in distress.",
