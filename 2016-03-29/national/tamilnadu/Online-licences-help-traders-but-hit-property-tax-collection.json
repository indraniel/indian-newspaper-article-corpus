    "text": "As traders get trade licences online without paying property tax, revenue dips\n\nThe online system of issuing trade licences in the city is a boon for traders. For property tax collectors of Greater Chennai Corporation though, it is a stumbling block.\n\nDue to this newly introduced facility that enables traders to get their trade licences with the minimum of difficulty, tax collectors are unable to exercise a strategy whereby traders defaulting on property tax payment are forced to pay by denying them trade licence.\n\nAs part of a spirited effort to reach the mammoth target of Rs. 650 crore as property tax this year, Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to withhold renewal or issuance of trade licence for those who have property tax arrears.\n\nAll the 15 zones of the civic body have also identified property taxpayers with arrears with the aim of denying them the renewal of trade licence this year.\n\nHowever, such traders are renewing their licences without paying property tax in the respective zones, utilising the new system for issuance of trade licence.\n\nUnder the new system, trade licence applicants have to visit the Corporation website \u2014 www.chennaicorproation.gov.in \u2014 to submit applications for new trade licences or licence renewal. The civic body has recognised more than 500 different trades in the city for which licences should be obtained from it.\n\nSome traders were also reportedly using statutory provisions relating to public health to get trade licence.\n\n\u201cThe new system will continue even if the tax collection is affected. We will focus only on improving services,\u201d said an official of Chennai Corporation.",
