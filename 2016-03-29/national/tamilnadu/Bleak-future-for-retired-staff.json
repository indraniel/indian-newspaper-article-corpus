The reason is delayed payment of pension and other retirement benefits.\n\nThe delayed payment of commuted pension, dearness allowance arrears and in certain cases the pension amount itself is driving employees to take desperate measures. More than 8,000 retired employees are running from pillar to post to get their pension benefits.\n\nM. Natarajan, who worked as a driver for Tirunelveli Transport Corporation at Kovilpatti depot, distressed at having to wait for several months to get the commuted pension amount, committed suicide.\n\nThe family members of R. Jayaraman, who worked as a driver in the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) at Basin Bridge depot, were not able to save him, because of lack of funds.\n\nMr. Balakrishnan said except for employees of MTC and State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) the other six transport corporations \u2014 Madurai, Villupuram, Kumbakkonam, Salem, Tirunelveli and Coimbatore \u2014 have been defaulting on various retirement benefits.\n\nArumugam Nainar, secretary, Tamil Nadu State Transport Employees Federation, said what was disheartening was the manner in which the commuted pension (one-third amount of the total pension amount paid in advance) entitled to an employee at the time of retirement was yet to be paid, but that \u2018recovery\u2019 was being carried out.\n\nAt present the commuted pension has been proposed to be paid in 24 monthly instalments, literally making a mockery of the commutation of pension system, he also added.",
