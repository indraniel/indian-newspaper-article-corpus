Kumar\n\nYou might have enjoyed riding a gasoline-run automobile or an electric one. Have you ever fancied going on a ride in a hybrid gasoline-electric two-wheeler?\n\nTwo engineering graduates of Dr.S.J.S Paul Memorial College of Engineering and Technology have developed a hybrid two-wheeler, which also generates power to charge its battery.\n\nPandiyaraj R. and Rakesh S., who recently completed their Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering, designed the innovative automobile as part of their project with the basic concept of combining fuel driving and electrical driving system.\n\nThey claim that this hybrid vehicle can give a mileage of 130 km, using a litre of petrol and the battery.\n\n\u201cWith one litre of petrol, one can drive up to 60 km while the battery in the bike will give another 70 km with a speed of 50 km/hr. The electrical driving system is installed in a fuel driving system by altering the allocations sufficient for the compatibility of the driver,\u201d said Pandiyaraj.\n\nIn order to combine the two systems, a fuel powered two-wheeler which is more efficient for the installation of the electrical system is modified with a battery cage, controller box, electronic sensor throttle, motor controllers, dynamo controllers, power convertors and electronic systems.\n\nRakesh said: \u201cOnce the fuel gets exhausted, the vehicle can be switched to electric driven system. Thus, the stored power is sufficient to run the rear wheel hub motor. The vehicle moves with the help of rear wheel motion provided by the motor.\u201d\n\nThe power generation is done with the help of a front wheel hub motor that acts as a dynamo when the vehicle is running using petrol. This generated power is stored in the battery while the hub dynamo produces the power. They have modified the solar convertor to stabilise the power stored in the battery. A tripping system is also installed to control excess power generation.\n\nPandiyaraj added that the controller wirings were provided with safer insulations to reduce the system from failure. \u201cThe motor runs to provide power for low-speed driving conditions where internal combustion engines are least efficient. In accelerating, passing, or hill climbing where high power is required, the battery provides power to electric motor to assist the engine,\u201d he said.\n\nHailing from a middle-class background, they are waiting for an opportunity to further develop this model and get a patent.\n\n\u201cWe want to reduce the weight of the battery, which is 28 kg. But it will require more investment which we are not able to afford. We will soon apply for a patent and look for support,\u201d added Rakesh.",
