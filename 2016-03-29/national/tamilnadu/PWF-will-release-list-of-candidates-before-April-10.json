    "text": "A list of candidates contesting the assembly polls representing People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) from various constituencies would be released within April 10, said R. Mutharasan, State secretary, Communist Party of India, here on Monday.\n\nHe told media persons that the election was only between the AIADMK and PWF. Over the last 40 years, the AIADMK and the DMK ruled Tamil Nadu, but there was no path to development. But, now the PWF with the ally of DMDK had emerged as a vibrant alternative to these Dravidian parties and earned a welcome reception among people, he said.\n\nDuring the last five year AIADMK regime, people were not happy with the governance and all such anti-incumbency votes would come in favour of the PWF in the ensuing polls, Mr. Mutharasan said.",
