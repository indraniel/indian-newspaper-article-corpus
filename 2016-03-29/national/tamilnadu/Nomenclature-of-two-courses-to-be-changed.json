    "text": "To bring equivalence with degrees offered by majority of the universities, Madurai Kamaraj University has decided to convert the B. Sc. (Software) and M. Sc. (Computer Science and Information Technology) courses offered by the university and affiliated colleges into B. Sc. (Computer Science) and M. Sc. (Computer Science) respectively.\n\nA resolution to this effect was passed at the Academic Council meeting here on Monday. Moving the resolution, G. Arumugam, chairman, Board of Studies for Computer Science (UG and PG), said that the change would help the students as they were finding it difficult while appearing for examinations like State-level Eligibility Test. He said that the IT Industry also expected standardised courses now.\n\nThe colleges providing B. Sc. (Software) and M. Sc. (CS-IT) would change the nomenclature to B. Sc. (CS) and M. Sc. (CS) for admissions from the academic year 2016-17 while students already pursing B. Sc. (Software) and M. Sc. (CS-IT) would continue with the same.\n\nSimilarly, a resolution was also passed to change the nomenclature of Integrated M. Sc.\u2013 Ph. D. in Genomics to just M. Sc. (Genomics).",
