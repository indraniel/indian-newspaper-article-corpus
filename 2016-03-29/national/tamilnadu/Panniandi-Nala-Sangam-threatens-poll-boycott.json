However, as on date, only 32 applications had been issued, and the remaining applications remained shelved. Only two certificates were issued in Denkanikottai; 11 in Hosur; 9 in Pochampalli and 10 certificates in Krishnagiri, the Sangam stated.\n\nAccording to G.Gurumurthy, district secretary of the Sangam, even these community certificates were issued only after consistent protests by the community.\n\nThe authorities refused to consider applications, where the father of the applicant had been issued a certificate; and also where the immediate kin of the applicant had a certificate.\n\nThe long-pending demand was also derailed by the frequent change in respective tahsildars, he said. Students who would be completing school education were the worst affected without community certificates.\n\nAlleging betrayal by the political parties in each elections, the Panniandi community has now declared poll boycott, if the authorities fail to heed to their demand before April 15.\n\nEarlier, students of the Panniandi community arrived at the Krishnagiri taluk office with a petition.",
