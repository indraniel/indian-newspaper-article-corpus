    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu has asked the Election Commission to not ask for any documents from traders for carrying cash up to Rs. 3 lakh and has also sought the return of money seized from traders after taking a written undertaking.\n\nThe traders\u2019 body also passed a resolution to hold a large demonstration in Tiruchion April 12 against the Election Commission\u2019s measures. \u201cThe EC\u2019s strict measures have led to business declining by 30 per cent for small traders,\u201d a statement said. \u201cIf these measures continue, the general public might end up getting affected as there might be a shortage of essential goods,\u201d the statement said. They also plan to meet the Chief Election Commissioner and petition him for exemption.\n\nSmall traders carry cash for marriage, medical treatment, buying raw materials, and receive cash for selling their goods and this practice has been in vogue for a very long time, the statement said. \u201cThere cannot be any sort of proof for carrying this cash. The Election Commission\u2019s teams can, if required, take an undertaking with their address from the traders and not seize this cash,\u201d the statement said. They also sought the return of money seized from traders and asked the EC to separate it from money seized from political parties\u2019 functionaries.",
