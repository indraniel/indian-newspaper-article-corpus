    "text": "DA increase for pensioners\n\nIn a decision that will benefit over one crore Central government employees and pensioners, the Union Cabinet has increased dearness allowance by six per cent to 125 per cent of their basic pay with effect from January. The State pensioners are in a state of penury. Their sufferings cannot be described in words. Hence, I request the Tamil Nadu government to get necessary approval from the Election Commission and sanction the increase on a par with the Central government pensioners immediately.\n\nG. Nagasamy,\n\nRamanathapuram\n\nDivert trains\n\nThe Virudhunagar-Tenkasi railway line has been neglected for many years. Three passenger trains to Madurai and one express train to Chennai are running from Shencottah and no new train has been introduced in more than 10 years, though the existing ones are running with full capacity. There are no direct trains to Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Mumbai or Delhi from Tenkasi.\n\nTowns like Tenkasi and Srivilliputtur, which are places of tourist interest, and Rajapalayam and Sivakasi with industrial and business importance are in this line. Chalukya Express, which is running from Mumbai to Tirunelveli, via Virudhunagar and Kovilpatti, can be diverted through the Virudhunagar-Rajapalayam-Tenkasi-Ambasamudram route. Since there are other trains in the Virudhunagar-Kovilpatti-Tirunelveli line to Bengaluru and Mumbai, people may not be affected much by this diversion. One pair of passenger trains from Shencottah to Madurai can be extended to Salem, via Namakkal, so that the poultry farmers in Tenkasi and Shencottah taluks can have direct access to Namakkal. I request the railways to consider these proposals.\n\nC.K. Rajasingh,\n\nPavoorchatram.",
