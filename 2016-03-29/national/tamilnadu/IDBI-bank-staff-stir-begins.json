    "text": "Opposing the Union government\u2019s move to dilute the share, the employees of IDBI Bank commenced their four-day stir from Monday.\n\nAccording to the union representatives, the Finance Minister in the budget had announced that the Centre would begin the process of transforming IDBI Bank by disinvesting its share. This was against the commitment given in the past in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by the then finance ministers that under no circumstances the share of the Union government would be diluted and that it would be above 51 per cent.\n\nWhen such was the assurance given, the present government\u2019s decision to dilute its share was unfortunate and against the established norms of a public undertaking. The four-day strike from March 28 to 31 by the employees is to draw the attention of the government to stop the move and reconsider its decision.\n\nThe meeting was addressed by trade union representatives. Meanwhile, in a press release, the IDBI bank employees had threatened to intensify the agitation, if the government did not withdraw the move in public interest.",
