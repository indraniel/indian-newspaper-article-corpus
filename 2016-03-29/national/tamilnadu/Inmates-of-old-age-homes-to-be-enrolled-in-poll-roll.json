Rajaraman inspected the homes on Sunday.\n\nThe District Election Officer found that 61 of the 93 inmates of the homes either did not have their names enrolled in the voter list or had migrated from one constituency to another on being admitted to the home. \u201cThe names could have been deleted after they migrated from their place of dwelling to the old age homes. For six of them, their names were enrolled elsewhere. We identified such people and our officials gave them relevant forms for inclusion or change of address, so that we can achieve 100 per cent polling in the Assembly election,\u201d the Collector said.\n\nOut of the four old age homes in the district registered with the Department of Social Welfare, the officials had undertaken the enrolment activity in January.",
