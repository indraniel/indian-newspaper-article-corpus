Pichumani\n\nCommuters boarding Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses at Esplanade junction bus terminus are extremely unhappy with the way the facility is being maintained.\n\nThe terminus was originally a facility of the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) which operated long-distance buses from there. However, ever since such services began to be operated from the Chennai Moffusil Bus Terminus (CMBT) in Koyambedu, the Esplanade junction has been used by the MTC.\n\nThe terminus, located adjacent to Madras High Court, has no shelters either for passengers or for the MTC crew.\n\nTemporary measure\n\nCommuters, drivers and conductors too complain that in the absence of toilets, they suffer considerably. The crew also said the roads inside the terminus were very poor and had not been re-laid in many years.\n\nM. Satish, resident of Thandavarayan Street in Royapuram, said that as a temporary measure, authorities had filled up the road with gravel and mud, and swirls of dust would go up every time a bus entered or left the terminus.\n\nWhile the main Broadway bus terminus is located on N.S.C. Bose Road, the MTC operates a few buses bound for north Chennai, including those to Mathur MMDA, Tiruvottiyur, Ennore and Manali, from this small terminus, MTC staff said.\n\nThe crew say the roads inside the terminus have not been re-laid in a long time",
