    "text": "Members of Parents Association of Sainik School, Amaravathinagar have appealed to the school administration to ensure that students, who make into the school through All India exams at Standards VI and IX levels, should not be given transfer certificates till completion of Standard XII.\n\nAfter a meeting of the members, S. Eswaran, president of the association, told reporters that some of the parents had complained to the association that the school had contacted certain parents of Standard X and Standard XI students who have not been performing exceedingly well, and given the hints that they would have to take transfer certificate for poor performance.\n\n\u201cLast year, similar situation has arisen and we went to the court to prevent any issuance of transfer certificate for poor performance\u201d, said Mr. Eswaran.\n\n\u2018Baseless\u2019\n\nWhen contacted, school principal Group Captain T. N. Sridhar told The Hindu that the allegations of any plans to issue transfer certificate for any student on the basis of poor performance were \u201cbaseless and untrue\u201d. \u201cTransfer certificates are issued only as per the CBSE guidelines\u201d, he said. He clarified that the association was not a recognised body as far as the school was concerned to have any interactions.",
