    "text": "The Parent Teachers Association of Jaiva Bhai Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School has submitted a memorandum to the corporation officials expressing disappointment over the delay in the school getting back the academic blocks illegally occupied by Rotary Club school.\n\nThe corporation officials in May last year regained the possession of the academic blocks from Rotary Club school after Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition of Rotary School in 2014 seeking relief from a High Court order to shift the school from the Jaiva Bhai school campus.\n\nIt was the PTA of the school that initiated the 18-year-old legal struggle to get the Rotary School vacated.\n\nS. Banumathi, president of PTA, said though the corporation officials took back the possession, the buildings were not handed over to the school. Officials of various departments were citing some technical corrections that need to be made in the revenue records before the buildings could be handed over.\n\n\u201cThe authorities did not stick to the assurances given over the months that necessary corrections will be made quickly. It is the responsibility of the corporation administration to make necessary coordination to see that the buildings been handed over to the school, said the PTA members.",
