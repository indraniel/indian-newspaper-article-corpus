What does it mean to see the UNESCO\u2019s world heritage city, inhabited for more than 7,000 years, constantly bombed?\n\nIt was the quest to find an answer to these questions that resulted in the documentary film \u2018 Young Syrian Lenses .\u2019\n\nIn a small corner of the 700 acres of the Pondicherry Central University campus facing the Bay of Bengal, three Italians impaled our complacence with the voices from war-torn Syria. They brought to this sleepy town the realities of the Syrian war that has killed tens of thousands and left millions of people homeless.\n\n\u201cAs we sit here discussing, there are millions waiting for refuge in the biting cold outside the borders of European countries. The European nations continue to erect fences to stop refugees from entering their countries and those who try entering are ripped off their belongings,\u201d says Italian journalist Filippo Biagianti.\n\nHe, along with Italian filmmaker Ruben Lagattolla and photographer Enea Discepoli was at the Pondicherry University to screen \u2018 Young Syrian Lenses \u2019 for the International Documentary and Short Film Festival here on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe only hear about geopolitics and military strategies in news and forget how it affects normal people. There were so many things in the news that were false and I wanted to tell what the reality was. Rather than resolving the conflict in Syria, the geopolitics has flared up deepening the crisis in this middle-eastern country,\u201d says Ruben Lagattolla.\n\nHe went to Syria crossing Turkey with photographer Enea Discepoli in 2014.\n\nMr. Discepoli wanted to organise a photo exhibition in Aleppo then. \u201cI visited this Syrian city in the 1970s to see its rich culture and heritage, which we had read about in our schools. It had beautiful gardens. But, when Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime started bombing it, it was heart wrenching to see the heritage city reduced to rubble. So, I went again for the second time in 2013. I took pictures and wanted to tell this story to the world,\u201d he said.\n\nIntrigued by the idea of organising a photo exhibition in Syria, Ruben went along with him. \u201cIt sounded crazy and interesting when Enea Discepoli wanted to organise this exhibition. The initial idea was to go to the exhibition and interview media activists and use photographs to show the effects of the war to the world. Once we went there, we realised that the venue of the exhibition was destroyed. Barrel bombs were being dropped by the regime every five to ten minutes terrorising people,\u201d said Mr. Lagattolla.\n\n\u201cAmidst the bombings, we witnessed people attempting to carry on with their routine life. We saw children playing and people sitting and drinking tea. It looked like they were waiting to die. There were citizen journalists who went around documenting and fighting through their cameras. It was scary but I wanted to record their lives. We worked with nine citizen journalists who were between the age group of 21 to 25 for this documentary. It was a collective trauma,\u201d he added.\n\nThrough this documentary, they want to convey that the present humanitarian crisis could have been averted way back in 2011. \u201cIf the world nations had acted early to overthrow Assad and encourage civil society to establish a democratic government, the Islamic State would not have emerged. Instead of countering the terrorists, Russia and Assad regime are bombing civilians and rebels,\u201d he claimed.\n\nHe added that there were a good number of rebels who could have played a diplomatic role in establishing democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have now destroyed them, declaring them terrorists. While the terrorist Islamic State thrives without coming under attack, the civilians, rebels and those opposed to the regime continue to be killed.\u201d\n\nWill war bring peace in this region? Having travelled and documented conflict areas including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Libya for nearly 25 years, 64-year-old Discepoli says: \u201cWar is not a solution\u201d.",
