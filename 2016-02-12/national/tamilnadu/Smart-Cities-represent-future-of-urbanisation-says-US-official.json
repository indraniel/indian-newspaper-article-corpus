Speaking at a conference on Smart Cities organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the US Department of Commerce here on Thursday, Mr. Andrews said that Smart Cities represented the future of urbanisation, technology and sustainability, not just in India, but around the world.\n\nHe led a trade delegation of officials and 18 tech companies from the United States. \u201cBuilding the Smart Cities of the future requires all of us to work together and share lessons from around the world, just as we did in Paris during the climate summit,\u201d said Mr. Andrews.\n\n\u201cThree hundred million people are expected to move to India\u2019s cities over the next twenty years, roughly the entire population of the United States. This means that the decisions that India makes today about how to handle that growth will have huge implications for the future of this country, and the world. India has the chance to be a leader in the world\u2019s efforts to address global challenges such as climate change as well as a leader in the competition for capital and top talent,\u201d said Mr. Andrews.\n\nTrade delegation\n\ncomprising officials and representatives of 18 tech firms visit city",
