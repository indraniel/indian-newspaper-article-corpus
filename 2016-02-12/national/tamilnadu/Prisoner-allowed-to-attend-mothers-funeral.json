Rajapandi, brother of prisoner S. Palpandi, Justice P.N. Prakash pointed out that a petition could not be filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking a direction to the Superintendent of Prison to grant emergency leave.\n\nNevertheless, since the petitioner\u2019s counsel R. Venkatesan pointed out that the prisoner\u2019s mother died on Thursday and the funeral was to take place on the same day, the judge treated the criminal petition as a writ petition and ordered his release from the Central Prison here immediately.\n\nHe also directed the Superintendent to permit the petitioner\u2019s brother to attend the funeral under police escort at the expense of the State and bring him back to the prison by Saturday evening.",
