    "text": "Builders in the city have alleged that the inordinate delay in granting approval for building plans by the Corporation has seriously affected construction industry.\n\nIn a petition submitted to Commissioner Poonkodi Arumaikan on Thursday, Builders Association of India \u2013 Thoothukudi Chapter president A.P. Pio said that the inordinate delay in giving building plan approval, and fixing vacant land tax and property tax had seriously affected the builders for the past several months.\n\nIf the approvals to be given by the Corporation for construction activities were given within a stipulated period, it would be of great help to the builders.\n\n\u201cWhen we submitted a similar petition in October last, the officials assured us that this issue would be sorted out within a month. But, the assurance was not honoured. Consequently, ongoing construction activities have been stopped for want of approval. Hence, the Commissioner should look into this issue immediately and issue favourable orders,\u201d Mr. Pio said.",
