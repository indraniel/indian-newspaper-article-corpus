The DRI\u2019s Chennai Zonal Unit received specific intelligence that a gang had smuggled gold bars into India from Malaysia through the Tuticorin Port.\n\nA resident of Sikkal in Ramanathapuram district was the kingpin of the gold smuggling network. The gang had managed to smuggle in gold bars concealed in detergent powder packets.\n\nThe information was that the suspects had planned to move the container to a private godown while on transit to the CFS and replace it with a duplicate container bearing the same consignment number, seal and documents.\n\nAfter removing the gold bars, they would transfer the goods in the duplicate container.\n\nSpecial teams deployed at vantage points in and around port premises kept vigil for about a week.\n\nThey found that the private godown was located in the Mappillaiurani area in Thoothukudi. When sufficient evidence was collected that the container was moved out of the port, the DRI officials, in a simultaneous operation, took control of the container laden in a trailer, surrounded the private godown where a duplicate container was ready, took custody of four suspects and seized customs clearance documents.\n\nA search on the container moved from the port revealed 12 kg of gold bars concealed in detergent powder packets.\n\nBesides 40 cartons containing four lakh \u2018Djarum Black\u2019 cigarettes, an Indonesian brand, were found in the godown premises. After interrogation Mohammed Rafeeq, A. Selvaraj, Raju and Rahmat Ali were arrested under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.\n\nAsked why the gold bars were not detected at the time of customs clearance, a DRI official said there was no provision for scanner at the port and containers were checked manually.\n\nWhile not ruling out the possibility of criminals smuggling gold or other contraband into the country by adopting the modus operandi in the present case, he said containers cleared by customs moved straight to the CFS and there was little scope for the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel to intercept it.\n\nSince 2013, the DRI registered 73 cases and seized 591.02 kg of gold worth about Rs. 165.3 crore and arrested 100 persons.\n\nA resident of Sikkal was the kingpin of the network",
