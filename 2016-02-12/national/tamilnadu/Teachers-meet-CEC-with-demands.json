    "text": "The Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers Association has urged that the Election Commission to make alternative arrangement for election-related duties such as addition and deletion of names and delivery of voter ID cards. Teachers had raised this issue during last week\u2019s State-wide protest.\n\nAssociation coordinator P.K. Ilamaran said: \u201cWe are on election-related duty round the year and it affects teaching. There are around 3,000 voters in each booth and we are required to visit each household to verify the details. The Commission is an autonomous body and can appoint its own personnel for this work. We have requested that a clerk be appointed for this job.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the association met Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi and submitted a petition.\n\nThe teachers have also appealed that the order directing them to report to election booths be issued at least three days in advance.\n\n\u201cAt present, the order is issued just a day ahead of the election. Sometimes, teachers in villages and remote areas have to travel 250 km to report for duty. We have also asked that the people on election duty be provided food and protection during the poll,\u201d Mr. Ilamaran said.\n\nThe teachers have also urged that the Commission ensure basic amenities at the polling booths and sought exemption from election duty to those suffering from ailments.\n\n\u2018Make alternative arrangement for election-related duties\u2019",
