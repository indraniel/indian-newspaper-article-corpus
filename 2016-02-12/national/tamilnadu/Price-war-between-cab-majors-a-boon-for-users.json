This has prompted Ola, its competitor, to slash its fares to Rs 6 per kilometre but for its \u2018Share\u2019 services. Customers are happy with the drop in prices.\n\nAn official from Ola said, \u201cOver the past year, we have seen a significant increase in demand that is driving increased utilisation for driver partners in the city. We are able to pass on the benefits of these efficiencies to customers in the form of fares that are as low as Rs. 6/km with Ola Share.\u201d However, the competition between the two cab services has put drivers in a spot. Drivers say they don\u2019t do trips for the money anymore but for the incentive that they receive for completing a set number of trips during the day. While the number of trips varies according to the company, drivers say they need to work for as many as 12 hours to bag this incentive.\n\nThe work load is a problem, says a driver.\n\n\u201cWe are under pressure to complete these trips since we can make ends meet only if we get this incentive,\u201d a driver said.\n\nDrivers say they need to work\n\nfor as many as\n\n12 hours to bag\n\nan incentive",
