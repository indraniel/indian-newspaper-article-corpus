Santhosh (36) of Tholaiyavattam near Kulasekaram in Kanyakumari district was working as a teacher in the government higher secondary school at Pullukattuvalasai near Pavoorchathram and was living in nearby Ramachandrapattinam along with his family.\n\nAs he failed to return home on February 6, his wife Anusha filed a complaint with Pavoorchathram police the next day.\n\nWhen the police collected details about the calls made by Santhosh from his mobile phone, they zeroed in on one Pon Selvi of Pavoorchathram with whom he had spoken several times.\n\nAs her husband is working abroad, Santhosh allegedly had an illicit affair with her, which was opposed by her family.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Santhosh came to Pon Selvi\u2019s house on February 6 even as the woman\u2019s brother Murugan was there. As it led to a scuffle, Santhosh was beaten to death allegedly by Pon Selvi and Murugan. They buried the body in the backyard of her house.\n\nWhen the police grilled Pon Selvi, she reportedly confessed to the police about the murder. The body was exhumed on Thursday evening in the presence of DSP of Alangulam Sangu and Tahsildar, Tenkasi, Kandasamy. After the on-the-spot autopsy, the body was sent to the native place of Santhosh.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pavoorchathram police, after arresting Pon Selvi and Murugan, have picked up another male teacher from Tenkasi for interrogation as he also reportedly had an illicit affair with the woman earlier.",
