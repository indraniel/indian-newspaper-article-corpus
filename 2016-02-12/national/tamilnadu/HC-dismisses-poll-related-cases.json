    "text": "The impending elections to the Assembly has led to a spate of poll related litigations being filed in the Madras High Court Bench here which on Thursday alone dismissed two PIL petitions, one seeking a ban on promising freebies through public money and the other a direction to eliminate corrupt practices in polling.\n\nA Division Bench rejected the first PIL filed by R. Perumal on the ground that the issue of parties promising freebies in their manifestos had been decided by the Supreme Court on July 5, 2013 with a direction to the EC to frame guidelines in consultation with parties.",
