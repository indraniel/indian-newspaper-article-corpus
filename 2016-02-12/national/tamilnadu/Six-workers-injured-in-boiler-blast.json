Saroj (23), A. Dharun (20), A. Gunal (19), S. Birjun (20), C. Preetham (25) and D. Bikash (19) \u2014 suffered 100 per cent burns and were rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital .\n\nThey were among the 10 labourers from West Bengal working at Sri Nagalakshmi Pyrolysis Company at Orattukuppai .\n\nAfter preliminary inquiry, police said that the injured were at work near the boiler, two others were preparing food and two were watering plants when the accident took place. While some labourers claimed that the boiler went off when they opened it on the instruction of the supervisor, the police said that the boiler exploded, exposing the victims to intense heat.\n\nFour of the workers had joined the unit only 10 days ago and did not have prior experience working under such conditions. Others were working there for about eight months. Hospital authorities said that the workers\u2019 chances of survival were very less as they suffered severe burns all over the body. Judicial Magistrate-II of the Coimbatore Combined Court, Rajkumar, recorded the declaration of the victims. They were then put under sedation.\n\nAfter visiting the patients and speaking to labourers at the unit, District Revenue Officer T. Christuraj told The Hindu that officials from the Pollution Control Board and Inspectorate of Factories were conducting an investigation at the site.\n\n(With inputs from\n\nM. Soundariya Preetha)",
