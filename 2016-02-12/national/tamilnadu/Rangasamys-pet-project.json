    "text": "Chief Minister N. Rangasamy\u2019s proposal for the Government Medical College in his home constituency of Thattanchavady during the previous Congress regime and the sharp differences of opinion it evoked among some of his Cabinet colleagues was among the reasons that precipitated his ouster in 2008.\n\nThe college named after Perunthalaivar Kamarajar was conceived by Mr. Rangasamy in 2005 to provide free medical education. However, the project ran into trouble over its high cost.\n\nDelivering an emotionally charged convocation address, Mr. Rangasamy said the college should emerge as an excellent medical institution on a par with Jipmer. He also said students who graduated from the college should earn a good name and advised them to serve the people with humanitarian approach and save their lives.",
