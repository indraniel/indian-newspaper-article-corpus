Ethiraj recently ordered Rs.1 lakh worth \u2018My Stamps\u2019 with a to-wed couple\u2019s photos printed on them. He later sought for a special cancellation on the wedding covers too that would carry personalised stamps.\n\nThe Department usually releases special cancellation covers commemorating an event along with commemorative stamps. Mervin Alexander, Postmaster General (Chennai City Region), said: \u201cWe decided to offer the personalised cancellation cover as people will cherish the covers. As it is a special facility, My Cancellation will be available only for those who order a minimum of 100 sheets of My Stamp on the same theme.\u201d My Cancellation facility will be offered for Rs. 1,500. While a good number of people are visiting the Philatelic Bureau at Anna Road head post office campus to get their personalised stamps, the facility offered online has not gained much patronage yet.\n\nSince May 2013, nearly 16, 300 sheets of My stamps have been issued at Anna Road HPO. A sheet comprising 12 stamps costs Rs.300. However, of this, only 60 were booked online through Chennaipost website.\n\nThe Department has earned a revenue of nearly Rs. 49 lakh through the My Stamp initiative. Officials of the postal department said lack of awareness among customers could be behind the poor patronage of the online facility for ordering My Stamp.",
