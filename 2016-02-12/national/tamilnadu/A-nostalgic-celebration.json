This year it fell on February 8.\n\nThe festivities will last for 15 days ending with prayers on every day in the morning and in the night by the senior most member of the family leading the rituals.\n\n\u201cWe never celebrate any other Chinese festival because the exact customs and traditions connected with them are not known much to this generation. My grandparents fled China like many others following the disastrous effect caused by the China-Japan war in the 1930s,\u201d said Sebastian Leo Shaou Kang Min and his brother Stephen George Min, both doctors.Celebrations for Min family starts on the eve of the New Year with entire members, spread over three-generations, gather for a sumptuous dinner.\n\nEven the feast have a speciality. The number of dishes will be an 'even number' as per traditions.\n\nWe had 12 dishes this time, said Dr. Sebastian Min.\n\nFor a change, the dinner had chicken soup, prawns, eggs wrapped in chicken and 'curry' made of pulses, all in Chinese style.On the New Year day, the head of the family opens the front door, the family burst crackers, and distributed sweets to neighbours and friends.",
