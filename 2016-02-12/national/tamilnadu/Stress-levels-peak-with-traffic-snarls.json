Each driver does at least eight trips a day. The shortest duration of a trip is 40 minutes and the longest is close to two hours. \u201cOn an average, we drive 380 kilometres every day,\u201d drivers who attended the workshop said. The stress largely derives from having to reach destinations on time. Many drivers said that they were forced to drive fast owing to the timings, which, they claimed, were outdated.\n\nSources said travel duration fixed for various routes over 45 years ago were still being followed. Sources said that a study was carried out by the MTC a few years ago that concluded that increasing the duration of every trip could help reduce stress levels.",
