Jyothimani and P.S. Rao vacated the stay and allowed the Tamil Nadu Road Transport Corporation (TNRDC) to continue with the work.\n\nStrengthening work to wait\n\nHowever, the issue of strengthening work along 13 stretches and at seven junctions between Mamallapuram and Koonimedu would be decided later.\n\nDuring the hearing of the case, Special Government Pleader Abdul Saleem had said about 85 per cent of the widening work between Akkarai and Mamallapuram was complete and since the work was stalled following the injunction, accidents were on the rise in that road.\n\nPosted for further arguments on March 14\n\nThe Bench posted the matter for further arguments for March 14.\n\nPetitioner S. Venkatesh, in his application, had contended that the widening of the ECR was being carried out without any proper study and the work had resulted in the uprooting trees along the road which was affecting the coastal zone.\n\nHe claimed that necessary prior clearances were not obtained for the work.\n\nInjunction granted on widening of ECR between Akkarai and Mamallapuram vacated",
