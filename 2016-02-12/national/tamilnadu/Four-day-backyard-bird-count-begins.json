They will be joined by one lakh bird enthusiasts across the world.\n\nThe compilation of more than 7,000 lists, totalling 735 species, earned India the status of second highest among all participating countries. House crow, common myna, Asian koel and black drongo were the most common species reported in India. The GBBC in the country is being coordinated by Bird Count India, an umbrella group of a number of birding, nature and conservation organisations.\n\nWe get information at a scale that is unimaginable with the participation of people across the country. Such data have now become valuable as we seek to understand and address issues relating to climate change at various scales,\u201d said V.B.
