Krishnamoorthi who was at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital helping the victims of boiler burst at Oratukuppai said that in a similar incident Chandan of Bihar and Chandran of Odisha were killed at Veerapandi Pirivu in April last.\n\nMigrant labourers\n\nMr. Krishnamoorthi said that the district administration should take an account of the number of migrant labourers working in various industrial units in this district.\n\n\u201cThey come here to work for a better wage. Employers here hire them without providing proper training,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cContinuance of such incidents shows that safety of labourers is taken for a ride,\u201d he said. The State Government should provide training for migrant labourers before they were employed in heavy and hazardous industries.\n\n\u2018Arrest owner\u2019\n\nThe owner of the firm should be arrested for failing to ensure safety of workers. Relief should be provided for the family members of the victims by the employer till the labourers were back to work.",
