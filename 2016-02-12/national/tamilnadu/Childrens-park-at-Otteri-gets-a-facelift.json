    "text": "Owing to increasing patronage, the Vellore Corporation has spruced up the children\u2019s park at Otteri.\n\nOfficials of the Corporation said the park received a facelift after there was overgrowth of bushes and shrubs, and a few play equipment required repair and replacement.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s council, during its meeting in December, had given its nod to take up renovation works at a cost of Rs. 11 lakh. Residents said the park received good crowd during weekends. For a city that has limited getaways, this spruced up facility could come as a breathing space.\n\n\u201cThe park was inaugurated by the Chief Minister in 2014. We have given a fresh coat of paint for the park. The works have been completed,\u201d said G. Shanmugam, councillor of ward number 44. He added that the flow of crowd to the park increased after the water level in Otteri Tank swelled following the November rains. Security personnel have also been engaged at the park, and an entry fee of Rs. Five is being collected.",
