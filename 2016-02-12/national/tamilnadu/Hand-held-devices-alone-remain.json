    "text": "All that remains of the TRMS is the issue of e-challan generated from the hand-held devices to traffic violators. About 70 hand-held devices were procured and given to the traffic police under the TRMS to issue e-challans to rule violators replacing the manual system. Ten devices were kept as a standby at the control room.\n\nSources say the hand-held devices are connected to the server in the control room and information regarding the violators obtained from the database and the e-challans issued. The devices would work till the expiry of the dedicated software after which it would automatically cease to function. Only 35 devices were working and the remaining needed to be serviced. If the hand-held devices become dysfunctional the city police would be left with no other choice and get back to the old manual system.\n\nThe hand-held devices are easy to handle and the police had collected fine to the tune of Rs. 10 crore from April 2010 till date from violators.",
