Elangovan that the party which aligned with the Congress would form the next government in the State, here on Thursday.\n\nTerming Mr. Elangovan\u2019s claim the best joke of the year, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that the Bharatiya Janata Party which was ruling at the Centre would form a strong alliance for the Assembly elections in the State.\n\nThe NDA government, headed by the BJP, would implement 10 railway projects in Tamil Nadu which were not implemented by the previous UPA government headed by the Congress, he noted.\n\nThe People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) would vanish after the announcement of the elections.\n\nThe Union government would consider the demands of jewellers and goldsmiths, he added.",
