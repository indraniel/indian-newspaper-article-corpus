If need be, the Congress would approach the court on the issue, he said.\n\nMr. Elangovan charged Chief Minister Jayalalithaa with not doing anything beyond writing letters to the Prime Minister on the GAIL issue. \u201cThere has been no serious approach,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Elangovan said the Congress will take part in the \u2018Loan Waiver Convention\u2019 planned by Federation of Farmers\u2019 Associations in Erode on February 19.\n\nMr. Elangovan slammed the AIADMK for saying the Congress was dependent on actor Khushbu\u2019s support in Tamil Nadu. Ms. Khushbu, who was also present, said there was no need for the Congress to rely on an actor and that the party considered her a cadre. \u201cIf the AIADMK were to say that I am an actor and the Congress is after me, let them remember that Ms. Jayalalithaa also came from the tinsel world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not\u201d, Ms. Khushbu said, when asked if she would share stage with DMK leader Karunanidhi. \u201cI have only left the party, my respect for Kalaignar remains,\u201d she said adding \u201cI have not yet decided about contesting elections.\u201d\n\nStaff Reporter adds from Coimbatore: Later in the day while returning from Erode to Chennai, Mr. Elangovan told journalists at the Coimbatore Airport that the party will decide on the number of seats and where to contest after finalising its alliance. Claiming that the AIADMK is trying to win the election by not imposing a ban on liquor, he hoped that people will bring an end to that party\u2019s rule.Mr. Elangovan also said that the BJP can implement total prohibition across the country instead of blaming other parties ruling in various States for not enforcing prohibition.",
