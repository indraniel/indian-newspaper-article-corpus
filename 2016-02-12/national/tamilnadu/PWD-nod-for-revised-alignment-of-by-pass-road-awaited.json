The farmers alleged that laying the road across the tanks would affect irrigation and their livelihood. It was suggested that the NHAI could build the bypass road without affecting the irrigation sources.\n\nSo, a public hearing was held in December 2011 to elicit the views of locals on the possible alternative alignments for the road.\n\nAlthough the district and NHAI authorities were said to have agreed on a revised alignment to take the bypass road along the bunds of the irrigation tanks, the work has not restarted pending the issue of a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Public Works Department for the revised alignment.\n\nMeanwhile, farmers who took up the issue to the court opposing the laying of the road across the tanks, however, say that they were not against the project as such. They contend that they were not against laying the bypass road but only wanted the water bodies to be protected.\n\n\u201cThe project has been hanging fire since 2010 and the Chief Minister during her campaign had assured that it would be executed as per the court directions. If no decision is taken at the next Cabinet meeting, I have planned to go on a hunger fast in front of the Secretariat in Chennai from February 22,\u201d said M.P.Chinnadurai, district president, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, who was among the farmers leaders who had opposed the laying of the road across irrigation canals.\n\nSources in the NHAI said that they were hopeful of getting the NOC from the PWD soon as the matter has been taken up with the higher officials of the department in Chennai.\n\n\u201cWe have been assured that the NOC will be issued within a week. We are ready to execute the work even though it will involve cost escalation. After the NOC is issued, further action will be initiated,\u201d a senior official of NHAI said.",
