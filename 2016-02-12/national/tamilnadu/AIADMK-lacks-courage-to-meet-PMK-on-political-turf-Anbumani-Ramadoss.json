    "text": "The AIADMK government lacked courage to meet the PMK on a political turf and has thus resorted to backhand tactics to scuttle the PMK\u2019s leap, said Anbumani Ramadoss here on Wednesday.\n\nClose on the heels of the Madras High Court passing an interim stay on works at \u201cVGP Thidal\u201d, which is the scheduled venue for PMK\u2019s State Conference, till Friday, the party\u2019s Chief Ministerial candidate said theAIAMDK\u2019s move was a lame attempt to browbeat the PMK owing to its growing popularity among the people. The conference is scheduled to be held on a private land on Vandalur - Urupakkal GST Road in Kancheepuram on February 14.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of local visit here, Dr. Ramadoss said the government did not object to the use of the venue for a political meeting when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Vanigar Sangam conference.\n\nThey should have objected 10 days ago when the High Court granted PMK\u2019s plea to hold the conference. \u201cThey deliberately waited till the last, after all the preparations were made.\u201d\n\nAlleging that the TNPSC was filled with political appointments, Dr. Ramadoss said, \u201cThere is no woman, or a minority community member, and seven of the members are of same caste. It is a betrayal of the people of the State.\u201d\n\nOn the political alignment, Dr. Anbumani said, \u201cif a political alliance was forged, it will be based on a common minimum programme led by the PMK.\u201d",
