Jayandhi signalled the opening of dam in the presence of farmers and Public Works Department officials after special pujas were performed.\n\nShe said the water release would benefit for recharging wells and water courses so as to benefit 19,000 acres in the district.\n\nThe water level at the dam was 172 mcft as against the total capacity of 235 mcft. The water will be released for 12 days up to January 25. The outflow will be maintained at 130 cusecs.\n\nV. Raju, Executive Engineer, Lower Bhavani Basin Division, told The Hindu that the dam could not be opened for irrigation because of high TDS level primarily due to inflow of polluted water in the Noyyal river.\n\nThe concerted efforts and good rainfall during the last Northeast monsoon season had made the way for decrease in TDS level in the storage water. The TDS level was now well below the permissible level.\n\nThe water had been released following the demand of farmers.\n\nIt would be helpful to recharge the ground water and wells in Aravakurichi and neighbouring areas. It would benefit horticultural crops raised by farmers through well irrigation.",
