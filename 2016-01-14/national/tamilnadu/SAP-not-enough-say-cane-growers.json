    "text": "Terming the State government\u2019s State Advised Price of Rs. 2,850 per tonne too meagre, sugarcane growers have urged Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to review the pricing taking into account the cost of cultivation. They want Rs. 3,600 a tonne. However, a section of growers are happy that the government announced the SAP without succumbing to pressure tactics of sugar mills.\n\nThe Centre had fixed the Fair and Remunerative Price for cane procured during the 2015-16 season at Rs. 2,300 a tonne. The State government declared an incentive of Rs. 550 including transportation charges of Rs. 100 a tonne, for a total State Advised price of Rs. 2,850.\n\n\u201cThough all public sector and most of the cooperative sector sugar mills had paid money for suppliers last year, private mills had piled up arrears on incentive to farmers for the cane supplied over the past two years. It is close to Rs. 950 crore. Under these circumstances, the Chief Minister has announced the SAP. We wonder whether the growers will get any benefit. We look up to her to ensure that,\u2019\u2019 says president of Pettaivaithalai Cane Growers\u2019 Association, Tiruchi, K. Anbalagan.\n\nAdverse market conditions have forced the sugar mills to default on payment to suppliers. Though the SAP announcement is welcome, only removal of Value Added Tax on sugar and reduction of VAT on its by products will help mills turn profitable and facilitate payment to farmers. The Chief Minister must help growers in asking the mills to pay the current dues and arrears in one go , according to the State technical secretary of Consortium of Indian Farmers\u2019 Associations G. Ajeethan of Namakkal.\n\nClaiming that the cost of cultivation has gone up , general secretary of Federation of Farmers\u2019 Associations in Delta Districts Arupathy P. Kalyanam opines that the thrust of the State Government must be on ensuring that the private sugar mills and some cooperative mills that have defaulted on payments pay the arrears to the growers in one settlementInquiries in the sugar industry circles indicated that there was a concerted attempt to delay the SAP announcement and even if it were to be done a hiked incentive was sought to be avoided.",
