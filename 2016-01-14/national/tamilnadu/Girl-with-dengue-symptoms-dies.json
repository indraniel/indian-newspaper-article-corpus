    "text": "Tension prevailed at Sankarankovil Government Hospital for a while on Wednesday after a 16-year-old girl, who was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday night with suspected symptoms of dengue, breathed her last.\n\nAs R. Karpagavalli, a class XI student from Malaiyadipatti Colony near Karivalamvanthanallur in the district, suffered from fever her father Ramar, a farmer, took her to a private hospital. Even as she was under medication, Karpagavalli wrote her half-yearly examination.\n\nAs the fever did not subside and her condition worsened, she was admitted to a private hospital, where the doctors reportedly diagnosed that the platelet count in her blood was dwindling fast. Hence, she was referred to Sankarankovil Government Hospital, where she was admitted on Tuesday night. Even as the treatment was going on, she died around 3 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother Vellaiyammal said that Karpagavalli initially responded to treatment at the Government Hospital. \u201cHowever, the absence of doctors and qualified nurses on duty at night led to the sudden death of my daughter,\u201d Ms. Vellaiyammal alleged.\n\nHospital sources said that the patient was given \u2018idli\u2019 in the small hours even as the fever was subsiding and the foodstuff got stuck in the respiratory tract to trigger the sudden collapse. Refusing to accept the doctors\u2019 explanation, relatives of the deceased started gathering at the hospital and alleged that the \u201ccallous approach\u201d by doctors and nurses had led to the death of Karpagavalli, and demanded the arrest of those who were on duty on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, the protesting relatives accepted the body after the doctors and the police explained to them the causes of her death.",
