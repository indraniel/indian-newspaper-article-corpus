Ganesan\n\nAhead of Pongal, sugarcane prices this year are at least 25 per cent higher than last year, say traders.\n\nSukumar of Koyambedu Wholesale Fruits, Vegetables and Flower Merchants Association said one piece of sugarcane cost Rs. 30 on Wednesday. \u201cThis is for the best quality. There are also sugarcane available for Rs. 15 each. The demand is high now because we have received far less than we usually get,\u201d he said. People pay anywhere upto Rs. 60 per sugarcane in the city\u2019s retail markets.\n\nTraders anticipated 300 trucks of sugarcane to arrive from various places but only 150-200 had reached the city till now, he added. \u201cThe reason for the demand is that government has directly procured a huge quantity from farmers for distribution to people as Pongal gifts,\u201d he added. The gift packs, distributed through ration shops, contain one kilogram of rice, sugar, Rs. 100 and a sugarcane.\n\nS.S. Muthukumar of the association said: \u201cApart from the government directly procuring sugarcane, the other reason for increased demand is that we did not receive the load from Cuddalore as everything was washed away in floods. The harvest was good, but unfortunately the floods destroyed the stocks. But we have received loads from Salem, Athur, Thanjavur and Madurai,\u201d he said.",
