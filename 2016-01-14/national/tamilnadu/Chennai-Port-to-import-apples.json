    "text": "Chennai: The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has lifted restriction on apple import through Chennai Port.\n\nThis move will increase revenues for the port and will also bring down the cost of apples by a few rupees. Statistics indicate that the Chennai Port imports more than 50 per cent of apples.\n\nIn September 2015, the DGFT issued a notification that apples would be imported only through the Nhava Sheva Port in Maharashtra. After that price of the fruit shot up in many places including Tamil Nadu.\n\n\u201cThere were issues relating to customs valuations and valuations of apple and that is why import was stopped,\u201d said an official from a Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cChennai Port handles more than 6,000 cartons of apples. Post the restriction the port lost huge revenues. There was a customs revenue loss of more than Rs 500 crore,\u201d said Chozha Naachiar Rajasekar, President of the Tamil Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIndia imports apple from countries including New Zealand, Australia, China and US. Within India, apple growing areas include Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Arunachal Pradesh.",
