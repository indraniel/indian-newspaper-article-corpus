Customers can feel the saris even as they check the products, without sales assistants hovering over them.\n\nThe wooden floor, the novel shapes of the shelves and the tastefully done interiors are inviting. Rani and her friend, residents of Central Leather Research Institute quarters, have been frequenting the shop to check out the products. \u201cWe have come here for the third time in the past two weeks. We came here earlier too, before the showroom was remodelled. But now, we enjoy the experience,\u201d said Rani.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers\u2019 Cooperative, better known as Co-optex launched its first boutique in October, following a government order permitting the organisation to upgrade four shops across the country under the Tamil Nadu Innovation Initiative Scheme. The government has sanctioned Rs. 1.2 crore to remodel a shop each in Chennai, Coimbatore, Kochi and Delhi. In the other three cities, the boutiques are expected to begin functioning by February.\n\nAccording to the order, \u201cthe branded boutiques would create unique and high quality merchandise. The aim is to extend marketing support to the co-operative societies and promote production of handloom products in the cooperative sector.\u201d This would also create continuous employment opportunities for handloom weavers in the State, the G.O. said. Co-optex\u2019s Managing Director T.N. Venkatesh said, \u201cThe basic idea is to give exclusiveness and provide more visibility to the brand. It allows customers to make their own choice as they can see and pick products.\u201d",
