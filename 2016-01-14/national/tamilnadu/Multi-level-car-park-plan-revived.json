We also want to explore the possibility of an underground car park,\u201d he added.\n\nCurrently, the car park at the airport sprawls over 46,300 square metres. The plan to construct a multi-level car park was first proposed in 2010 as part of the modernisation plan of the airport. Then, officials had said that though tenders were floated, the work could not be taken up as they were not happy with the response.\n\nThough Rs. 2,000 crore was spent as part of the expansion, work on a car parking lot was never taken up. Now, this project has emerged once again as part of the phase II expansion of the airport. The expansion, estimated to cost about Rs. 2,300 crore, includes the expansion of domestic and international terminals of the airport. This may take at least three years for completion.\n\nOwners of taxis and even personal cars prefer parking their cars along Grand Southern Trunk Road as they feel the parking fee is too high.",
