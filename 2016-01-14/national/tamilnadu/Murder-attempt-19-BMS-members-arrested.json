    "text": "Police have arrested 19 members of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) on the charge of attempting to murder a fish exporter at Rameswaram in the district.\n\nPolice said the BMS, which monopolised the loading operations of fish export companies in the island, objected to P. Ramanathan, owner of a fish export company, engaging his own men for loading on Tuesday evening.\n\nThey carried wooden logs and attempted to attack him, police said adding, the Temple police registered cases against them under sections 307 and 341 of Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nThey were arrested on Wednesday and remanded in judicial custody, police also said.\n\nAs police suspected that the BMS members would create a problem, Additional Superintendent of Police (Prohibition and Enforcement Wing) S. Velladurai visited the island and ensured that there was no trouble when the accused were remanded, police said.\n\nPolice said the BMS prevented export companies from engaging those who were not members of the sangh.\n\nThey insisted on engaging their members at the rate fixed by them and demanded commission from the companies when they engaged outsiders, police said.\n\n\u201cThis practice has been going on for long and this was the first time, a company owner came forward to lodge a complaint,\u201d a police officer said.",
