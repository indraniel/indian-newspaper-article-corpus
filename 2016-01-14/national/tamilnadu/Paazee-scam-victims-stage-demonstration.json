    "text": "Around 150 members of Paazee Nidhi Niruvanathal Bathikapattor Nala Sangam demonstrated in front of the office of the One-Man Committee for Paazee cases at Ramanathapuram in the city on Wednesday. They wanted the committee to expedite the process of disbursing money to members of their Sangam.\n\nThe protestors said that their association based in Madurai with more than 5,000 members was the first to take up the issue in court and expose the scam.\n\nIn November 2014, the prime accused in the scam Mohanraj was granted conditional bail for six months by the Madras High Court to liquidate money and return it to the investors. The court also directed formation of a one-man committee led by a retired judge to identify victims and help them get back money taken by Paazee directors.\n\nProtestors said that the court directed the committee to give priority to members of their association who have lost Rs. 150 crore.\n\nBut despite extension of the bail twice so far, they were yet to get their money. They claimed that the delay was because the committee also identified victims who were not members of the association.\n\nPresident of the association N. Nachimuthu led the protest. They claimed that the committee has said the process will be expedited, following which they called off the protest.",
