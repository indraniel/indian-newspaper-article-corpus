Authorities suspect them to be the mammals that were rescued and sent back into the sea earlier.\n\nThis brings the total number of dead pilot whales in Thoothukudi to 73, counting the 45 carcasses that were washed ashore on Tuesday. .\n\nOfficials collected samples from the carcasses for autopsy\n\n. The dead whales were buried at Manapad and Kulasekarapattinam beaches.\n\nThe samples will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, and Central Marine Fisheries and Research Institute and Fisheries College of Research and Institute, Deepak Bilgi, wildlife warden, Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, told The Hindu .\n\nAccording to G. Lakshmanan, associate professor of zoology, Aditanar College of Arts and Science, Tiruchendur, dehydration of the mucous in the skin of whales might have caused death. The whales might have migrated from the ocean to feed on small fishes.\n\nThe recent heavy rain might have caused changes in water current in the deep ocean, shifting the original location of prey.",
