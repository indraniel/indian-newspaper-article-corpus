GOVARTHAN\n\nThe higher price of sugarcane is proving to be an outcome of demand-supply dynamics, in the wake of the government's decision to gift each of the family card holders with Pongal Pack consisting of 2 ft of sugarcane along with 1 kg rice and sugar, and Rs. 100.\n\nUnlike last year when a stalk was sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, this time, the starting price is Rs. 40, irrespective of the girth and length.\n\nSellers say they would still be making only a thin margin of profit.\n\nSeasonal sellers are usually middlemen who provide credit to the sugarcane farmers and procure the produce.\n\nThis time, the farmers have become assertive, since the Cooperatives Department is believed to be offering them a better procurement price.\n\n\u201cThis time around, farmers who used to supply sugarcanes are prepared to repay the loan along with interest instead. They are keen to dispose off their produce to the Cooperatives Department,\u201d said a seasonal seller.\n\nAs a consequence, there is a drop in the number of retail sellers. For, the State Government has decided to provide 2 ft cane to each of the 1.91 crore family card holders, the sellers say.\n\nThe Chief Minister\u2019s announcement also covers holders of police cards and Sri Lankan Tamil families living in refugee camps across the State. Fortunately for the sellers, 2 ft of sugarcane is hardly sufficient for even one person.\n\nAlso, every family celebrating the festival in a traditional way needs two entire stalks. Hence, there is still scope for decent business, customers say.",
