However, they did not want to share details of the venues for the race.\n\nTraditional sports\n\nOn January 14, Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Peravai and Tamil Nadu Rekla Club (TNRC) will organise a signature campaign at Olympus in the city to save the two traditional sports and the native breed bulls used in these sports. \u201cFor Pongal, hundreds of bull owners have threatened to decorate their animals, perform pujas and abandon them on the roads in Pollachi and in Coimbatore,\u201d TNRC\u2019s organising chairman R.S. Thirumurugan told The Hindu .\n\nSoon after Union Government lifted the ban on the sport, preparations began in full swing in and around Pollachi area to organise rekla race. Festive spirit gripped Kallapuram, Arasampalayam and Thondamuthur in Pollachi and at Chatram and Chandrapuram, in Udumalpet (Tirupur District). They hoped to conduct the sport in a grand manner after 19 months. But directions from the Supreme Court have disappointed them.\n\nStarting with a mass protest and rally at Pollachi on Wednesday, organisers of the traditional sports have decided to organise a series of protests to revoke the ban.\n\nBlack flags\n\nOn Wednesday hundreds of farmers brought their bullock carts with black flags in a procession to the Pollachi Sub Collector\u2019s office and submitted a petition to the Sub Collector, urging the State and Union Governments to lift the ban.\n\n\u201cBan on the sport would lead to the ultimate extinction of these high quality native breed cattle . Animal lovers and rights activists claiming to protect the animals from alleged torture will be responsible for these breeds getting wiped out,\u201d Secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Parmpariya Kalachara Trust, S. Jayaprakash said. He said that 300 pairs of bulls used to take part in the race at Pollachi. \u201cBut only 60 pairs were registered for the first race that was scheduled to take place in the region at Kallapuram \u2013 after the ban came into effect from May 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe numbers will go down further as they will now be sold for slaughter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe organisers do not want to share details of the venues for the race\n\nBull owners threaten to decorate their animals, perform puja and abandon them on roads",
