Ravikumar here on Wednesday seeking compensation to those affected in the heavy rains and subsequent floods in parts of Thoothukudi in November last year.\n\nWhile addressing the media, he said that 12,000 petitions, collected from affected people, were submitted to the Collector. Several parts of Thoothukudi district, especially in Ottapidaram and Srivaikuntam, were affected by rains between November 9 and December 28.\n\nThe rain caused damage to 10,000 houses, claimed lives of 12,000 cattle-heads and damaged five lakh acres of farm land.\n\nSince the district administration was lethargic and was not prompt in executing relief and restoration works, the issue was taken to the attention of the Madras High Court Madurai Bench and some works had been carried out based on the court\u2019s direction.\n\nThe High Court on January 11 directed the authorities to provide relief to victims who suffered damage to their houses, agricultural crops and loss of cattle after assessment. The court directed the authorities to re-lay damaged roads. The relief and restoration works should be carried out after getting funds from government by January 28 and camps must be held in the villages of affected people, Mr, Krishnasamy said.",
