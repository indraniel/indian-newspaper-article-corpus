    "text": "Expressing displeasure over the alleged failure of the Centre in releasing adequate funds to Union Territory, Chief Minister N.Rangasamy on Wednesday said the Centre should release funds generously as the UT has been implementing a host of welfare programmes.\n\nAddressing the gathering here in the presence of Union Minister of State Pon Radhakrishnan, the Chief Minister Rangasamy said Puducherry had been worst affected due to cyclone Thane but the Centre had not released the amount of compensation that it had agreed to grant.\n\n\u201cThere has been heavy damage in Puducherry due to unprecedented rains and floods. After the Centre released Rs.50 crore as interim relief, it asked the UT government to utilise the fund from its Plan Outlay and it would make all our plans go awry,\u201d said Mr. Rangasamy.\n\nHe also demanded that the Centre release additional assistance to extend its support for welfare programmes of his government.\n\nStating that his government has been taking consistent efforts to improve infrastructure, Mr. Rangasamy pointed out that Rs.529 crore was allocated to the Public Works Department to undertake various projects.\n\nHe also thanked the Centre for the grant of Rs.87 crore for improving tourism.\n\nMr. Rangasamy said Puducherry attracted more number of tourists these days and it received 2 lakh tourists on January 1 alone. Adding that the government has been planning to implement more projects to improve tourism, he said the Centre should come forward to allocate more funds.\n\nMr. Rangasamy said the government had plans to make Villianur a temple town.",
