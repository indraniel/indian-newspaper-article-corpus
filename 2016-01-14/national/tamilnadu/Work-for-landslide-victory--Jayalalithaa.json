    "text": "AIADMK general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Wednesday urged party cadres to work with total involvement for the landslide victory of the party in the ensuing Assembly elections. She was addressing cadres after inaugurating the AIADMK\u2019s offices in six districts through video conferencing from the party head quarters in the city. She said this function was a precursor to the party\u2019s splendid victory at the polls.\n\nInvoking the party founder MGR\u2019s name, Ms. Jayalalithaa said the AIADMK had been founded by \u2018Puratchi Thalaivar\u2019 after an evil force had hijacked the Dravidian party that was started with the lofty ideal to create society where everyone should get everything. \u201cThe AIADMK will continue to work for the people for hundreds of years to come,\u201d she said.\n\nAppreciating the work of the district secretaries of Villupuram (south), Namakkal, Karur, Theni, Dindigul and Pudukottai for having constructed the party\u2019s office buildings in central localities, she said other districts too will have offices soon. Already, Dharmapuri, Villupuram (north), Coimbatore and Puducherry districts had party offices. She said party cadres should utilise the office space to meet and discuss the strategies for the party\u2019s victory. The AIADMK supremo also unveiled the statues of MGR at the party offices.\n\nThe vote of thanks was proposed by Industries Minister and Namakkal district secretary P. Thangamani over video conferencing from Namakkal and Finance Minister and party\u2019s treasurer O. Paneerselvam from the party headquarters.\n\nHundreds of cadres lined TTK Road and Avvai Shanmugam Salai, the route that she took. Party cadres had put up banners, organised music bands and Chenda melam to welcome her.",
