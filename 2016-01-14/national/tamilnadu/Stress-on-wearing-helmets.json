Kotnis flagged off the rally in the presence of Assistant Superintendent of Police, Tuticorin Town, P. Arun Sakthi Kumar, and Regional Transport Officer K. Anand. Wearing helmets, the participants of the rally assembled near Tuticorin South police station on Palayamkottai Road and rode two-wheelers through WGC Road, Victoria Extension Road, Devarpuram Road and returned to the starting point\n\nTalking to the media, Mr. Kotnis said that 77,000 cases were booked in the district in 2015 against those who did not wear helmets. The rule apart, the riders should realise that wearing helmets provided safety to them, the SP said.\n\nPamphlets on road safety were given to the public near the traffic signal on Palayamkottai Road.
