    "text": "Has urbanisation robbed Pongal of its rustic simplicity and its spirit of celebrating nature?\n\n\u201cIn my childhood, Pongal preparations used to start nearly a month ahead with the whole village involved in decorating and repainting their homes,\u201d Allirani Balaji, chairwoman, child development committee of Rotary International District 3000, told The Hindu . \u201cEvery ritual and custom had a scientific and psychological basis, but over the years, we seem to have lost our awareness of these links,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cSunlight played an important part during Pongal festivities,\u201d said Ms. Allirani, who is originally from Kulithalai. \u201cNearly every activity, especially cooking of the fresh paddy crop, was done in the open, and watching the starch water boil over used to bring great joy. Nowadays we make the Pongal in a pressure cooker, where the water gets absorbed by the rice,\u201d she said.\n\nThe streamlining or complete avoidance of some Pongal practices had affected the Tamil identity, she said. \u201cAs farmers have opted to use machines over oxen for tilling the land, the number of cattle in the villages has come down too. The group cleaning and parading of livestock has also become very rare now,\u201d she said.\n\nFor K.T. Tamilmani, associate professor and head, Department of English, Nehru College, the \u2018Surya Pongal\u2019 festivities in his native Thanjavur used to be over early in the morning. \u201cThe fresh paddy has been replaced by store-bought rice, and those of us in the city usually cook it only by around 9.30 a.m. Pongal used to be a festival of thanksgiving. Now it has become so abridged and materialistic that many of the younger generation don\u2019t know what we are celebrating. The old joy is missing,\u201d Dr. Tamilmani said.",
