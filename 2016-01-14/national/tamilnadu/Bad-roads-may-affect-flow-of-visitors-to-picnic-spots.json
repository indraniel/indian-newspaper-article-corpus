    "text": "Pleasure trips, especially on two-wheelers, may be tiresome and dangerous\n\nThose who are planning pleasure trips to picnic spots on \u2018Kanum Pongal\u2019, particularly on two-wheelers, may have to think twice as all roads leading to these places are in bad shape.\n\nAs Papanasam and Manimuthar dams attract thousands of visitors on \u2018Kanum Pongal\u2019 every year, hundreds of vans, cars and bikes will use Palayamkottai-Papanasam highway. But this stretch is full of uneven surface and potholes.\n\nThough Highways Department has filled up huge pits on the road at Melapalayam, road-users, especially two-wheeler riders, cannot enjoy a safe riding owing to the uneven surface. The \u2018huge\u2019 speed-breakers at Karungulam Munneerpallam and Tharuvai also cause accidents every day.\n\nThe stretch between Gopalasamudram intersection and Cheranmahadevi is without upper layer.\n\nFollowing repeated complaints from the public and adverse reports in newspapers about the condition of roads, the officials are filling up potholes between Cheranmahadevi and Veeravanallur. While this repair work somewhat facilitates safe riding of four-wheelers and commercial vehicles, the road still poses threat to the two-wheeler riders.\n\n\u201cThough the Highways Department has repaired the road for about 2 km near Kallidaikurichi, you\u2019ll have to apply all your driving skills to avoid craters along the stretch between Ambasamudram and Papanasam. Several accidents happened on this road due to these potholes,\u201d said Shaik Abdul Khader of Ambasamudram.\n\nAs the department has decided to convert Tirunelveli-Tenkasi highway into a four-lane stretch \u2014 land acquisition process has already commenced \u2014 relaying of the existing stretch has been ruled out.\n\nWith huge pits, the stretches between Old Pettai and Manonmaniam Sundaranar University; Vellalankulam intersection and Seethaparpanallur; and Maranthai and Alangulam are unsafe for the bike riders.",
