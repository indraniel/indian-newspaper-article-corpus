    "text": "A man has moved the Madras High Court seeking proper investigation into the drowning of his 11-year-old son in a swimming pool at Queens Land Amusement Park near Chennai 10 months ago.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, Easwaran, his son E. Prabakaran was studying in class VI in Sri Lakshmi High School in Tiruvallur. On February 21, 2015, Prabakaran went to Queens Land on a school excursion.\n\nAround 2 p.m. that day, a teacher called Mr. Easwaran and informed him that Prabakaran was admitted to a hospital as he suffered from breathing problem. When Mr. Easwaran rushed to the hospital, he was taken to the mortuary where his son\u2019s body was kept.\n\n\u201cEven before the post-mortem examination was conducted, the school management was desperate to strike a settlement with the help of the police personnel,\u201d Mr. Easwaran contended. The police and school authorities allegedly threatened him to withdraw a police complaint about the incident.\n\nAlleging that even after several months, the police had not made any progress in the investigation and not even furnished the autopsy report, Mr. Easwaran approached the court seeking a direction to the police for a proper inquiry.\n\nHe also sought compensation from the school and the amusement park.\n\nAdmitting the petition, Justice R. Subbiah ordered notice to the Department of School Education, Sri Lakshmi High School, and the Queens Land Amusement Park.",
