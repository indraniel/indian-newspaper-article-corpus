The festival is the epitome of Tamil culture. We thought we should start with the college as far as respect for all religions are concerned,\u201d said Principal S.K. Dash.\n\nRituals like drawing kolam and singing of traditional songs were followed, said S. Alamelu Mangai, Assistant Professor, Post Graduate and Research Department of Home Science.
