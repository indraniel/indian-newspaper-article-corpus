    "text": "Sivaganga/Ramanathapuram: Police have arrested about 70 people, owing allegiance to various organisations, including Jallikattu Peravai, when they attempted to block trains at Devakottai Rasta railway station in Sivaganga district, even as people staged protests at several places in Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga districts, demanding removal of ban on jallikatu.\n\nThe police said that members of Peravai, led by its State secretary Narayanan and district president \u2018Siravayal\u2019 Velusamy, walked in a procession to Devakottai Rasta railway station when the police arrested them. Members of Tamil National Movement, Tamil Culture Protection Movement and Communist Party of India (CPI) were among the arrested, the police said.\n\nThey shouted slogans against the Centre and demanded that the Central and State governments remove legal impediments and facilitate conduct of the bull-taming sport during Pongal. Mr. Narayanan said that it was disappointing that the Supreme Court had stayed the Centre\u2019s notification when arrangements were in full swing for organising jallikattu at several places in the State.\n\nAt T. Pudur, villagers hoisted black flags and a section of men tonsured their heads in front of the Dharma Muniyan di Temple to register their protest. Those who opposed the ban on jallikattu also staged demonstrations near the bus stand in Sivaganga.\n\nIn Ramanathapuram district, tension erupted at Sayalkudi and Kanjirankudi, when villagers came with bulls and attempted to block roads. After the police officials held talks with them, they staged a protest, raising slogans against the Centre, and dispersed.",
