Lund, president of Credai \u2013 Coimbatore Chapter, said: \u201cCoimbatore has always been a good place to live in, after Chennai. The affordable housing segment here has grown over the years. These units are priced below Rs. 50 lakh category.\u201d\n\nCoimbatore\u2019s property market has witnessed an upward push in demand for residential units in the core areas of the city such as R.S. Puram, Avinashi Road, and Race Course, which are considered posh areas. Nevertheless, it has no shortage of affordable housing options. Places including off Avinashi Road, Saravanampatti, Mettupalayam Road and Trichy Road are witnessing a lot of small projects.\n\nCoimbatore is a market where 40 per cent of real estate investments come from those living in cities such as Bangalore, Kochi, and Chennai. Apart from the demand from professionals engaged in IT/ITeS, Coimbatore is emerging as a retirement destination, and demand for 2 BHK homes is high from senior citizens.\n\nDemand for smaller apartments is primarily from young IT professionals, while villas and row houses see demand from NRIs, retired persons, and IT professionals.\n\n\u201cWith the IT sector, automobiles and traditional businesses growing at a steady pace here there is more demand for affordable housing. This city is also the hub for senior citizens,\u201d added Mr. Rajesh.",
