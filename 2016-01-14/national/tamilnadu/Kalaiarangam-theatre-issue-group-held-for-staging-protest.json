A group of 21 members led by Ms. Kasthuri went to the Collectorate in connection with the issue and squatted in front of the portico.\n\nThe group remained at the same place even after talks with the Revenue Divisional Officer when they were picked up by the police and taken to a marriage hall.\n\nMs. Kasthuri claimed that she had applied for C-Form renewal in November. However, it was not given as the district administration sought building stability certificate from the Public Works Department. She said the stability certificate had to be obtained by the committee as it owned the building.\n\nMeanwhile, the revenue officials on Wednesday issued a notice for not having obtained C-Form renewal. Sources said C-Form was not issued as the building stability certificate was not produced. She and others who were taken into custody were later released.\n\nC-Form renewal, required for continuous running of the theatre, was\n\nnot obtained",
