With sugarcane being integral to Pongal festivities, loads of cane has started to arrive to Long Bazaar from various parts of the State.\n\nLong Bazaar, which has always been a one-stop for all festival needs, is now buzzing with crowd shopping for the harvest festival.\n\nCost of cane\n\nSale of sugarcane has started to pick up in Vellore. \u201cA bundle of sugarcane consisting of 18 to 20 canes cost Rs. 400 to 550 now. The cost depends on the cane\u2019s height and thickness. Last year, a bundle was sold for Rs. 300 to Rs. 500,\u201d Aslam, a shopkeeper said.\n\nVellore gets most of its sugarcane supply from Salem, Chidambaram and Kumbakonam, he said, adding, \u201cThe yield was good this year but the rains in November damaged crops severely. Now, it seems that the government is procuring the damaged canes, and hence, farmers have been able to breathe easy.\u201d Vendors sell single sugarcane for Rs. 50 to Rs. 70.\n\nThere cannot be sweet Pongal without jaggery. With jaggery being another key ingredient for the festival, the district\u2019s own-made jaggery is up for sale in Vellam Mandi. \u201cA kilo of jaggery costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 depending on colour.

Prices have been stable for sometime now. \u201cThe rates of most of the vegetables are normal. On some days, there is variation in cost due to dip in supply. But consumers have nothing to worry while purchasing vegetables for Pongal festival,\u201d said A.
