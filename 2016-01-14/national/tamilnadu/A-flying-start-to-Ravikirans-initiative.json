    "text": "Chitravina N Ravikiran has said that he had a flying start to his world record creating composing initiative at the International Institute of Tamil Studies, CIT Campus in Taramani, Chennai.\n\nHe had earlier announced that he planned to set to music the entire 1330 Tirukkural verses in just 50 hours. In an inspired flow, he was able to set music to nearly 350 verses in just over 3.5 hours, an average of over 100 verses per hour.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace, if I can maintain this kind of flow, I will be able to accomplish my goal of 1330 verses in under 24 hours,\u201d Mr.Ravikiran said at the end of the opening day\u2019s session.\n\nThe progress is being periodically updated at https://www.facebook.com\n\n/Tirukkuraltunesby\n\nRavikiran/\n\nMr. Ravikiran said he had employed Carnatic, Hindustani and Folk melodies for his tuning and also attempted several rhythmic innovations using talas scarcely explored so far, including Mishra Triputa , Mishra Mathya .\n\n\u201cIt is an artistic challenge since Valluvar\u2019s couplets have a unique meter with the second line shorter than the first. I found inspiration to try traditional but rare talas to ensure that the melodic beauty, rhyme, meter or meaning will be projected better. This can enable them to be performed more frequently in classical concerts by both vocalists and instrumentalists and also a wonderful way to make it more accessible and enjoyable for school students.\u201d",
