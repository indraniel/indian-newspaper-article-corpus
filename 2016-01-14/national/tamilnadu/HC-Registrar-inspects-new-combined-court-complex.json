    "text": "Following an order from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the Registrar (Administration) K.H. Elavazhagan inspected the new combined court complex, which houses 18 court halls, here on Wednesday.\n\nTwo senior engineers of the Central Public Works Department, members of the Tiruchi Bar Association accompanied him during the inspection.\n\nActing on a public interest litigation that the complex was not up to the standards with no proper maintenance and without adequate basic facilities, a Division Bench comprising Justice V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran appointed Mr. Elavazhagan to inspect the new building and submit a report to the court.\n\nThe litigation was filed by two advocates of the Tiruchi Bar Association before the High Court recently after several meetings between the Judiciary, Tiruchi Bar and the Public Works Department did not yield positive results. So, Mr. Elavazhagan inspected various court halls, judges\u2019 chambers and open corridors to ascertain the standard of quality of the building, inaugurated in April 2015.\n\nThe Tiruchi Bar Association president R. Baskaran said no provision had been made for the maintenance of the new building. Patch works alone had been carried out in the terrace of the building where tiles were not laid properly leading to seepage in the building, he said.\n\nThe Registrar will submit the report to the court on Monday.",
