Tamil Nadu has always championed intellectual liberty, but recent examples of the way writer Perumal Murugan and singer Kovan were treated are warning signs of the things to come,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice K. Chandru, Former Judge of Madras HC said he hoped to see an increase in patronage for the book festival here.\n\n\u201cThis is an important time to promote reading, writing and freedom of creative expression. Over the last year, we saw a number of authors return their Sahitya Akademi awards in protest against rising intolerance in the country. In the state too, there were a few written works which came under fire from various quarters,\u201d Mr Chandru recalled.\n\nThe Book festival is on till January 23.\n\nR.S. Shanmugam, trustee of the association said the proceeds will go towards flood relief. \u201cA few publishers did not want to postpone the festival and deny the opportunity to book lovers during the festive season which is why we organised this in the span of ten days,\u201d he said.",
