    "text": "In a departure from convention, the Tamil Nadu Open University will hold a meeting of its Syndicate on Thursday, the last working day of its Vice-Chancellor Chandrakantha Jayabalan.\n\nThe Syndicate members were informed by text message on Wednesday evening that the meeting would be held at 11 a.m on Thursday. \u201cThere was no indication of this meeting until the message. We have no information about the agenda either. But orally we were told that appointments for teaching positions will be coming up for approval,\u201d said a Syndicate member.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual for a Vice-Chancellor to chair a syndicate meeting on her last day in office. This has come as a surprise,\u201d the official added.\n\nA source in the university said the institution had issued advertisements in October 2015 for filling up 15 posts of assistant professors and associate professors. Between December 28 and 31 last, the interviews were conducted and appointments had been decided.\n\nThey require the Syndicate\u2019s approval for issuing appointment orders.\n\nSyndicate meeting without agenda\n\nTNOU Registrar S. Vijayan, however, said that the Syndicate was meeting without any agenda on Thursday. \u201cIt is the last working day of the incumbent Vice-Chancellor and the Syndicate has to organise a farewell for her.\n\nThe Syndicate would also form the three-member convenor\u2019s committee that would function in place of the Vice-Chancellor,\u201d he said.\n\nConventionally universities form convenor committees after a Vice-Chancellor demits office to prevent them from influencing the committee\u2019s functioning.\n\nThe University of Madras, where the Vice-Chancellor is demitting office shortly, is expected to form its convenor committee next week.\n\nProf. Vijayan, however, said the university was following the norms.",
