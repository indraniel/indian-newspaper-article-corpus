Madurai seems to be the exception,\u201d said P. Dalit Raja, who submitted a petition at the Collector\u2019s office in this regard recently.\n\nA TNSTC official contacted Mr. Raja as his complaint was forwarded to the TNSTC. \u201cThe official told me that fares were set as per the type of services. However, he failed to explain why there was a disparity among districts.\u201d\n\nA TNSTC conductor said that he had often faced complaints from passengers from neighbouring districts like Theni and Dindigul that the minimum fare here was higher.\n\nM. Muthupandian, a commuter, alleged that the minimum fares varied even among the same category of buses. \u201cWhen I board an SLF bus from Mattuthavani and get down near Apollo hospitals, sometimes I am charged Rs. 7 and sometimes Rs. 9,\u201d he said.\n\nV. Rajendran, Madurai division president of the TNSTC wing of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said, \u201cThe trick is, in Madurai, all the buses are either SLF or classified as Express and a minimum fare of Rs. 7 (SLFs) or Rs. 5 (Express) is charged respectively. Buses operated as ordinary services are almost zero, unlike in other places.\u201d\n\nAlleging that this was a strategy used by the TNSTC Madurai division to increase revenue, he said, \u201cwhen the fundamental issue is reduced spending by the government, public cannot be overcharged to compensate for increased spending,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother union functionary said that most of the SLF buses were operated in Madurai as other places like Tiruchi and Coimbatore had competition from private players. \u201cPeople would prefer the cheaper private buses there instead of paying extra for SLF,\u201d he said.\n\nBetter service\n\nAcknowledging that the minimum fares are higher in Madurai, S. Sampath from the TNSTC Staff Federation said that people should also compare the fares with those of share auto. In most places, share autos charged Rs. 10 as minimum fare. \u201cAt a time when there is stress on using public transport due to issues like pollution and climate change, people should not hesitate to pay a rupee or two extra to maintain better service,\u201d he said.\n\nSenior officials from the TNSTC were unavailable for comment.",
