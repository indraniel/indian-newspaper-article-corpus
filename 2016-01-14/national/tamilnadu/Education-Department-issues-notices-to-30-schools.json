    "text": "District Elementary Education Office here has issued notices to private nursery and primary schools for failure to renew registration.\n\nAccording to sources, when the officials scanned the list of 207 schools in the district, they found that 30 schools had failed to renew their registration that they were supposed to do every three years.\n\nThe schools had registered with the Office at the time of starting operations but failed to renew the registration thereafter. As part of the registration process, the schools should also furnish certificates relating to building , sanitary , fire safety and a few other documents.\n\nThe Office issued the notices a few days ago and gave the schools 15\u201320 days time to respond to those. Soon thereafter 15 schools had responded by applying for registration renewal, the sources said and added that they were waiting for others to respond.\n\nClosure\n\nIf the schools failed to respond, the Office would send a reminder and even thereafter if there was no move to renew the registration, it would order the school\u2019s closure, the officials added.",
