They said they were being fleeced .\n\nOne of the passengers, Prasannakumar of Ganapathy, who boarded the bus to Tiruchi at Gandhipuram said that there were about 35 passengers in the vehicle. They were asked to pay Rs. 450 per seat instead of Rs. 150 that the same operator collected on regular days. \u201cThe operator escalated the fare due to festival demand,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a heated argument the bus was made to stop at the police station where the passengers urged the police to initiate legal action against the operator.\n\nPassengers claimed that the police refused to register a case. And when they emerged from the police station, the bus had driven off.\n\nThe police claimed the passengers were yet to lodge a written complaint against the operator. Police sources also said that the issue would be referred to the transport department.\n\nThey said they were being fleeced by the operator and asked to pay\n\nRs. 450 per seat",
