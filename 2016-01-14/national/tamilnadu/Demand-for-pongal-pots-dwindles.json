Alagesan, a pot stall owner on Butterworth Road told The Hindu .\n\nIn the business for over 40 years, he said that small traders like him had been hit by promotion of earthenware by the city\u2019s major department stores.\n\n\u201cObviously we cannot offer discounts like the bigger stores, but people do bargain hard while buying from us too,\u201d said Mrs. Alagesan, who paints the \u2018muhurtham set\u2019 in bright colours. Sold as a set of 3 large pots and 8 accessories, these are used for wedding rituals.\n\nAlagesan stocks pots from Pudukottai district, Thanjavur and Manamadurai. \u201cSince their workmanship is better, they are costlier than our local stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nPongal pots from Kondayampettai near Thiruvanaikovil were being sold for Rs. 100 in the Butterworth Road stalls, while those from places like Madurai were going for Rs. 200-250.\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t sell during the Pongal season, we still have customers who require earthen vessels for funeral rites,\u201d said Mrs. Alagesan. \u201cOther than that, we sell kolam powder and brooms to make ends meet throughout the year,\u201d she added.\n\nFor M.S. Rachel Jebaraj, the recent rainy weather has hit her suppliers in Pondicherry, Dindigul and Cuddalore. \u201cWe are still waiting for our stock to arrive,\u201d Mrs. Rachel said. \u201cEven though business has been dull this year, we will manage to sell our stock completely.\u201d\n\nThe outlook is less rosy for Vedavalli, a 70-year-old who has been forced to shift to the street after her stall near Thepakulam was demolished. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder if I get to sell anything worth Rs. 50 in a day,\u201d said the vendor, who has been in the trade for 30 years. \u201cI buy 10 pots each time from a potter who comes from Thiruvanaikovil, because I can\u2019t afford to travel,\u201d she said. \u201cI make-do by selling kolam powder.\u201d\n\nKondyamapettai-based potter S. Ramu says that for a wholesale supplier like him, the orders for earthenware have actually gone up this year. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little more than 500 orders from Tiruchi for Pongal. Last year the rains affected the business in stoves,\u201d he told The Hindu as he prepared to fire 100 Pongal pots in the community yard kiln which is used by the colony\u2019s potters. The items are baked in shallow pits that are lined with straw, coconut husks and firewood.\n\n\u201cMy business has become diverted to the restaurants, where earthenware is in great demand,\u201d said Ramu. \u201cIn case the Pongal orders die out completely, I do hope clay tumblers can be promoted instead of paper disposables. They are faster to make than pots, and are completely bio-degradable compared to what is being used now,\u201d he said.",
