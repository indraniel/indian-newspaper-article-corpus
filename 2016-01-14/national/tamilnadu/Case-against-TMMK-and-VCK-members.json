Those booked under the section included M. Sathik Patcha, TMMK east district secretary, J. Meeran, TMMK union students\u2019 secretary, and U. Parakath Ali, town secretary, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, the police said.\n\nThe VCK office-bearers booked under the section included M. Jajakhan, union secretary, I. Sikkandar, town deputy secretary, and S. Naina Mohamed, town secretary, they added.\n\nThondi police forwarded the FIR to the local executive magistrate on Wednesday and they were likely to be summoned for executing the bond in the coming days.\n\nThe police said that after the 17-year-old girl student of the local Madrasa allegedly committed suicide by consuming poison last week following a family dispute, local VCK party men distributed pamphlets holding the Madrasa responsible for the girl\u2019s death.\n\nThis was objected to by the TMMK members and they clashed at least on two occasions, attacking each other, the police added.",
