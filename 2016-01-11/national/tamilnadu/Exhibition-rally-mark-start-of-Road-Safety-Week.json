Venkatachalam inaugurated the exhibition in the presence of District Collector S. Prabakar, Superintendent of Police M.R. Sibi Chakravarthy, Mayor Malliga Paramasivam and other dignitaries. About 350 students of AET Matriculation School and Nandha Group of Institutions and members of Driving School Associations took part in the rally.\n\nThe schedule for conduct of Road Safety Week has been devised by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to create awareness among general public on improving road safety, and involving all stakeholders to the cause.\n\nThe events will focus on sensitising public to the causes for road accidents and measures to prevent them.\n\nAccording to official statistics, 1.4 lakh persons are killed in road crashes every year, and many more get injured and disabled for life. Youth in the age group of 15 to 24 years account for 33 per cent of the total fatalities.\n\nWhile the National Road Safety Policy is being implemented in right earnest, reflecting in improved road engineering, enhanced enforcement and scaled-up emergency care, the Central Government is keen on involving citizens to make road safety a social movement.",
