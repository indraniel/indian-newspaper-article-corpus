Environment Minister Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam dedicated the lamp to the public on Sunday.\n\nThe Government\u2019s sanction of funds for conversion of the hitherto neglected tank into an entertainment location followed sustained struggle by the Ganirowther Tank Retrieval Movement for removal of encroachments.\n\nLast month, members of the Movement staged a demonstration demanding timely utilisation of the funds for beautification. They sought harnessing of water accruing from the Northeast Monsoon rain.\n\nThe water body on a 14-hectare expanse will, in due course, be deepened for raising the level of water table, and have pavements, fountains and lawns.\n\nIn the preceding weeks, the City Corporation removed encroachments on the bund and along canals conveying rain water into the tank.",
