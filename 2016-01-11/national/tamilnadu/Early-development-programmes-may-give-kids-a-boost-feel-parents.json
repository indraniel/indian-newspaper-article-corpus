Iyer, who founded \u2018mommy and me with Su\u2019 in 2013, defines her programme as a prep step towards schooling. \u201cAfter running a pre-school from 2010 to 2012, I realised there were very few programmes for mothers and toddlers in India so I decided to start this in Bengaluru,\u201d she said. So far, she has completed ten batches and has worked with 50 children and their mothers.\n\n\u201cThe class is to make parents aware of their children\u2019s milestones and also help them learn about their surroundings,\u201d she said.\n\nJose Paul and Anju Cherian, who own the franchise of the U.K.-based Baby Sensory, have three outlets in Bengaluru. Both studied early learning and development in UK. \u201cThe programme, which was started by in the U.K. provides information to parents on sensory stimulation for children and gives them insight on visual stimulation for children and their sense of touch,\u201d said Mr. Paul.\n\nThe nature of a class varies depending on the age of the child.\n\nIn one activity, children are allowed to play in an inflatable pool filled with toys. Once the music starts, they are made to move towards the toys, thus helping in sensory development. The programmes are divided into different categories \u2013 baby sensory and toddler sense, based on the age of the child. Paediatricians have a mixed response to such programmes.",
