Ramya, programme manager, AEAI, South Asia region. She adds that all the volunteers were felicitated during the \u201cCoffee with Volunteers\u201d event organised at Loyola college to recognise their contribution and the select volunteers who have come here are those who are deeply inspired to bring about change in their localities.\n\nThe group has people from diverse professions, and age groups with a goal to seek sustainable solutions to the city\u2019s problems.
