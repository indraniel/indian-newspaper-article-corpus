H. Hariraman, a commuter, said: \u201cThis is the first time I have used this service. Though I appreciate the way stations and trains are maintained, there are no skywalks or subways. Should we jump over the median?\u201d\n\nHe also said the road was congested during peak hours and there is hardly any space for commuters when they get off the station. \u201cWe have to walk very close to buses and motorists. They should have adequate footpath space too. We are scared we may be hit by a vehicle,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), though there are plans to have more signages in place soon, increasing the footpath space may be difficult. \u201cWe had to cater to this facility only with the available space. It is a very challenging situation for us,\u201d an official said. This station has a minimum passenger traffic of about 1,600 a day, he added.",
