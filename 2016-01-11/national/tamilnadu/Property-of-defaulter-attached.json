They have also warned of attaching and sealing property of others who fail to pay property tax.\n\nThe municipal administration had issued notices to the defaulter asking him to clear the dues to the tune of Rs.1.68 lakh in 2001 itself. The municipality is facing a financial crunch due to property tax arrears.
