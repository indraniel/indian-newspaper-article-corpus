    "text": "ATMs soon in Kancheepuram, Arakkonam, Park Town, Chengalpattu\n\nA fairly large number of residents have started using postal debit cards after the launch of automated teller machines (ATMs) at some post offices.\n\nThe Department of Posts has installed ATMs in eight post offices, including GPO, Anna Road, T. Nagar, Mylapore, Tambaram and Avadi. A total of 5,087 savings account customers, who maintain a minimum balance of Rs.500, have been issued debit cards so far.\n\nCustomers welcome the initiative as they can avoid waiting at counters, especially during peak hours in post offices. However, they wanted the department to open more ATMs. S. Rajpandian of Anna Nagar said that more ATMs were needed for senior citizens to draw money quickly and easily. The department must also take steps to allow customers to use postal debit cards in bank ATMs as well.\n\nAt present, there are nearly 2.50 crore accounts, including savings bank accounts and recurring deposits, in Chennai city region, that includes the suburbs too. Residents of city and suburbs contribute to 40 per cent of these accounts.\n\nMervin Alexander, Postmaster General (CCR), said ATMs would soon be added in post offices at Kancheepuram, Arakkonam, Park Town and Chengalpattu. Customers could also use these debit cards in any of the postal ATMs across the State.",
