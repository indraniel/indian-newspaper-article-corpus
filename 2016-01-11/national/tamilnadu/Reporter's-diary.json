Sundararaj struck a difference at the road safety week celebrations in Ramanathapuram on Sunday.\n\nAfter inaugurating the photo exhibition, highlighting road safety, the Minister was requested to flag off a road safety awareness rally but he took the organisers, the transport department and police officials, by surprise by started walking along with the volunteers.\n\nWhile the volunteers held placards of pictorial warnings against violating traffic rules, the Minister carried a bundle of pamphlets and started distributing them to road-users and passersby, en-route.\n\nAssistant Superintendent of Police S. Sarvesh Raj and Regional Transport Officer J Sheik Mohamed had no option but to follow suit the Minister.\n\nAfter walking around the new bus stand, covering a distance of about a km, they returned to the function venue in front of the bus stand. The Minister, who was known for coming to the rescue of accident victims while travelling, made a passionate plea to road-users to follow traffic rules and avert accidents.\n\nContributed by D.J.
