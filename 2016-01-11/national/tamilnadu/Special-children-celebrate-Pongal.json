Meenakshi of Sangukadai even as her son Arulprakash was actively participating in the events.\n\nP. Sundaram, another parent, said that traders and other private establishments should ensure job opportunities for differently-abled persons. \u201cWhat all the differently-abled persons need is honouring their rights on par with normal persons,\u201d he said explaining the working environment being provided for his son, P.S. Rajavelu, by the employer. Most parents wanted the setting up of a branch of the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities in Tiruchi to cater to the needs of the differently-abled persons in the central region. K. Nanmaran, vice-president of Siragugal, said that the availability of advanced equipment and other infrastructure at the institute catered to the various needs of the differently-abled persons.\n\nP. Sundaram, president of Siragugal, said the differently-abled persons resided at various places and hence remained scattered across the city. He said the association would construct a hostel if the district administration allotted a land to it.\n\nA paediatrician, A. Muthuram, said that there was a strong case for creating awareness of prevention of the deformity in new born. \u201cTaking due advantage of latest technology, one could prevent or even treat the foetus during the pre-natal period,\u201d he said.\n\nP. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the TNAU \u2013 Agricultural College and Research Institute, said a large number of students of the college, as part of extending support and care to the differently-abled, participated in the event.",
