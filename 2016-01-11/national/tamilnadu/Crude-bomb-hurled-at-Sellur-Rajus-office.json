Raju, at Sammattipuram here on Saturday night.\n\nPolice said none was injured. A bottle filled with kerosene was hurled at the office around 11:30 p.m.\n\nSenior police officials, who visited the scene, said the motive and people behind the crime were not known. In a similar incident, another crude bomb was hurled at the Madurai urban district unit of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam at Mathichiyam but it did not explode. Broken pieces of the bottle and a wick soaked in kerosene were found near the office.\n\nIt may be recalled that a similar crude bomb exploded close to the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple last week for which rivalry among street vendors was cited as reason.",
