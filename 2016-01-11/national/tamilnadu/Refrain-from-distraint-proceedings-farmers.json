Ayyakannu, state president, Desiya Thennindhiya Nadhigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, over 500 farmers from various districts wanted the banks to refrain from distraint proceedings and auctioning jewels. They urged the government to provide a compensation of Rs. 25,000 an acre for all those farmers whose crops were hit by the rain. The farmers urged the Centre and the State government to come out with a separate budget for agriculture and grant Rs. 5,000 as monthly pension to all those farmers and farm labourers who had attained 58 years of age. Providing three-phase power supply free of cost to farmers, new electricity connection to farmers within 15 days of applying for it, total withdrawal of plans to extract methane and gas from Tamil Nadu and remunerative price for farm produce were among their other demands.\n\nThe Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Vaiko who was in the city to attend party workers meeting came to the protest venue later to extend his support to the farmers.",
