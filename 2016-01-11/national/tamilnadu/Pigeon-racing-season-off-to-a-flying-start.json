Vedhan\n\nA group of veteran pigeon fanciers huddle together on the Chennai-Kolkata Highway, a national highway (NH 5) in Tada, around 65 km from the city early on Sunday.\n\nAround 7 a.m., the fanciers \u2014 who breed pigeons \u2014 release the birds from their wooden cages. In a matter of seconds, hundreds of these pigeons disappear into the horizon \u2014 signalling the start of the first leg of Chennai Racing Pigeons competition for the year.\n\nHomer pigeon fanciers from different areas of Chennai take part in the annual five-month-long competition. \u201cWeather and wind patterns are major factors,\u201d says veteran racer, 50-year-old M. Arumugam, secretary, Goodwill Pigeon Racing Society (GPRS) in Avadi.\n\nAnother pigeon racer, M. Thirunavukarasu, says developing homing instinct among the racing pigeons starts from pairing correct bloodline. Training, healthy feed, medicine and adequate rest helps racing pigeons to strengthen their homing skills. \u201cBonding between the trainer (mostly fancier) and the birds is a crucial factor in making homing birds into racing pigeons. It is not gambling as most people tend to view this. On the contrary, it is a sport and passion for bird lovers,\u201d explains Mr. Thirunavukarasu.\n\nSunday\u2019s event is the first step in a series of trips from Tada to New Delhi where homing racing pigeons will be released on the same route by increasing the distance.\n\nEach participant is allowed to send 12 racing pigeons for the short and medium-distance races.\n\nThe racer bird is tagged with a permanent ring bearing a four-digit number around its legs. It will have details such as year of birth, sex, species, the society with which it has been registered and the registered breeder.\n\nIt has an inner ring number, not known to the breeder of the bird when it is released. When the bird reaches its loft, the breeder gets to know the inner ring number and conveys it over phone to the society. The bird that arrives first into its loft or has taken the least time is the winner.\n\n\u201cPigeon racing is not banned under Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, but permission has taken from the Forest Department,\u201d says S. David Raj, District Forest Officer, Chennai.\n\nSunday\u2019s event is the first step in a series of trips from Tada to New Delhi",
