A total of 2,353 road accidents occurred in the district, causing 554 deaths and injuring over 3,000 people, Tirunelveli Regional Transport Officer K. Thangavelu said.\n\nThe number of fatal accidents rose to 504 in 2015 from 501, which claimed 540 lives, in 2014. There was a spurt in the number of accidents in November 2015 due to heavy rains, Thangavelu told The Hindu on Sunday.\n\nHe said that last year 539 people, involved in 276 accidents, suffered major injuries. Besides, 2,475 people suffered injuries in 1,510 accidents. Police booked 62 cases for rash driving and causing damage to vehicles and other objects under Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe RTO said that two-wheelers were involved in up to 55 per cent of the accidents, cars 30 per cent of accidents, buses five per cent of accidents, lorries and vans five per cent and other types of vehicles five per cent.\n\nPonnakudi turned one of the road accident hotspots in the district since there was no high mast light or traffic signal at this road junction. Other accident-prone areas were Thalaiyuthu, places near the bridge at Sankar Nagar, Vallioor bridge, four-road junction at Panagudi and a blind curve near Aralvaimozhi, he said.\n\nMr. Thangavelu said that plans were afoot to create a separate space near toll plaza at Nanguenri for drivers to refresh and take some rest.",
