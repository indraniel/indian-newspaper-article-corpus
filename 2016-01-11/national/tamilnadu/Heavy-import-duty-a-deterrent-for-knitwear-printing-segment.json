The entrepreneurs in the sector feel that the import duty presently levied at the rate of 30 per cent on printing inks, other raw materials and machine spare parts , and at the rate of 27 per cent on the machinery has affected the operational viability of the units. \u201cIt should be noted that 80 per cent of the printing ink used by the around 500 units in the cluster are imported from countries such as the United States of America, Italy, Israel and Japan. Almost 95 per cent of the modern machines used for knitwear printing here are imported\u201d, T. R. Srikanth, president, Tirupur Export Knit Printers Association, told The Hindu .",
