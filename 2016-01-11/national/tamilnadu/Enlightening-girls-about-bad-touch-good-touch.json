They feel it will help us to overcome the culture of silence related to child sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nPencils and balloons printed with the anti-abuse message are being given to children who do well in the show-and-tell contest being held at the stall. A 40-metre cloth bale has been getting filled up with the signatures of visitors who have taken the oath to protect children against abuse and violence.\n\nPosters highlighting the challenges facing children in the State such as child marriage, child labour, infanticide and gender-based foeticide and abandoning of infants, are on display at the stall.\n\nThe exhibition is open from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.",
