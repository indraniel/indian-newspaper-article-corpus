Residents in apartment complexes will have to segregate waste,\u201d said a source in the Authority.\n\nThe various environmental bodies in the State are also focussing on handling food waste, since it forms 16 per cent of the municipal solid waste and also leads to formation of landfill gas and leachate (any liquid oozing from garbage is called leachate and is a potential pollutant). It is formed in landfills when water infiltrates and percolates through waste and dissolves organic and inorganic components.\n\nOver the last decade with the growth of cities, the amount of municipal solid waste being dumped in landfill sites too has increased. For instance, seven years ago Chennai used to generate 3,400 tonnes of waste a day and now it is 4,700 tonnes. All of this, including the food waste that can be used to power lights or converted as compost, is dumped in the landfill sites.\n\n\u201cIt would help reduce the load on the landfill sites, reduce transportation costs and manure costs for parks. Biogas plants would produce electricity that can be used by the community and provide employment,\u201d explained a source in the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.\n\nBiogas plant\n\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has proven technology for micro and macro biogas plants and there are several functioning in Chennai. \u201cA biogas plant that can handle 100 to 200 kg every day costs less than Rs. 5 lakh. It will generate 2.25 kg of methane a day, which is over four LPG cylinders a month,\u201d explained Daniel Chellappa, senior scientist, Technical Coordination Wing, BARC.",
