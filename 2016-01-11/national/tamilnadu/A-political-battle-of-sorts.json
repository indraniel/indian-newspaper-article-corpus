    "text": "What was meant to be the inauguration of a workshop for self-help groups and sanitation workers on dengue prevention turned into a political battle of sorts on Saturday, as AIADMK MLA Anbalagan did not mince words in his criticism of the AINRC government. Mr. Anbalagan decried the state of public infrastructure and health initiatives of the government. He also said that the government must look into the blocked drainage system to tackle the spread of dengue. Local Administration Minister N.G. Pannir Selvam said dengue-carrying mosquitoes breed in clean water mostly found in and around the house. Mr. Selvam added that Mr. Anbalagan knew this, and to point out shortfalls of the government was his role as an Opposition leader.\n\nEyeing the\n\nfreebie pie\n\nOpposition party MLAs are anxious these days on whether the people of their constituencies would get freebies such as mixers and grinders from the ruling government. A rumour had been going around that the freebies would be stopped after the distribution at all constituencies held by ruling party which prompted Opposition parties to assail the government.\n\nSeeking to allay Opposition anxiety, Chief Minister N.Rangasamy assured that freebies would be given to all without any partiality.\n\n(Reporting by Annie Philip, R.
