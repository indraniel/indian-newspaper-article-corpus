Starting Monday, the new e-seva centres will have staff issuing Aadhaar cards, patta, nativity, community, birth and income certificates to residents.\n\n\u201cThe Corporation commissioned the facilities a few months ago. They even appointed personnel to man the counters. But residents were not offered any services because of the delay in inauguration,\u201d said P.V. Tamilselvan, Congress councillor in Ambattur.\n\n\u201cExisting e-seva centres collect charges ranging from Rs.10 to Rs.50. Residents want waiver of all the charges at e-seva centres. They should offer services free of cost,\u201d said Mr. Tamilselvan.\n\nChennai Corporation officials said TACTV had signed an agreement to offer free services relating only to Chennai Corporation. Services such as property tax payment, tax assessment application, company tax, professional tax, trade licence and birth certificate will be offered free of cost.\n\nResidents, however, will have to pay money for services relating to passport, Revenue Department and Social Welfare Department. For instance, residents will have to pay Rs. 50 for nativity certificate or community certificate issued by Revenue Department. Personnel at the e-seva centres would scan the original certificates and upload them instantly. Revenue officials concerned would issue the certificates based on the scanned documents. Applicants could collect the certificates from the e-seva counter, said an official.\n\nCorporation ward-level officials said the personnel manning the e-seva centres were not trained by TACTV properly.\n\n\u201cThey do not know how to talk to residents. They get Rs.8,000 as salary. They just know how to operate a computer. They need training on how to interact with a desperate resident in need of civic services,\u201d said an official at a ward.",
