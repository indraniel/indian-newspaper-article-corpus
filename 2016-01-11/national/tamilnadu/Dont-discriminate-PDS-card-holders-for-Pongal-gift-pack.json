    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Government should not discriminate public distribution system (ration) card holders while distributing Pongal gift pack, Coimbatore Consumer Cause has said.\n\nIn its appeal to the Chief Minister, the organisation\u2019s secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said that the State\u2019s announcement on distributing Pongal gift pack only to card holders who had opted for rice was unfair.\n\nThe gift pack contains one kg each rice and sugar, two-feet-long sugarcane and a sum of Rs. 100.\n\nRice card holders, police ration card holders and Sri Lankan Tamil card holders (those living in refugee camps) are eligible for the gift pack.\n\nThe discrimination between rice and sugar option card holders has led to a situation where rice card holders from high income groups would be eligible for the gift pack but not those low income group sugar card holders who run tea shops or sweet stall.\n\nGiven the fact that there is hardly any legal or procedural distinction between rice and sugar card holders, it is hard to see any logic in Government\u2019s decision to exclude the latter.\n\nIf at all the Government should fix eligibility criterion, it should be on the basis on income, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said and wanted the Government to extend the gift pack to sugar card holders as well.",
