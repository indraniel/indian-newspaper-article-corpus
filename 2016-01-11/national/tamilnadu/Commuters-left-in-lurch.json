    "text": "The Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) train services between Chennai Beach and Velachery are becoming popular by the day, but concerns about safety and infrastructure continue to bother commuters.\n\nThey say the MRTS services provide quick, effective and low-cost connectivity from one end of the city to another, but inadequate lighting, poor access, unhygienic surroundings and lack of well-manned parking lots are a deterrent in attracting more people. With the train services being mostly on an elevated stretch, each of the sprawling railway stations has their own set of problems, commuters complain. The Taramani railway station is located adjacent to the Information Technology corridor and has the potential to provide good intermodal transport facility, but is underutilised. The main concern for commuters, particularly women, is poor lighting on the access road leading to the railway station.\n\nSeema of Avadi, working for an IT company in Sholinganallur, said the presence of a government-run The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) liquor outlet near the railway station and inadequate lighting on the link road to the station made it risky for women, who were scared to use it due to chain-snatching incidents in the past.\n\nCommuters also complain that the absence of a parking contractor at night and the location of the ticket counter tucked well inside the railway station add to the problems. Commuters, however, are relieved that the RPF personnel are on duty at the platform.",
