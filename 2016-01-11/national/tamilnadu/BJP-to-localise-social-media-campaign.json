    "text": "The State BJP on Sunday held its first social media workshop to strengthen its campaign for the upcoming Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu, with localisation of content being the focus.\n\nThe meeting also saw party MP and national spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi exhorting the participants to be vigilant against \u201cmotivated and unnecessary\u201d criticism on the Centre and counter them real time.\n\nThe closed-door meeting saw about 500 attendees. Party media committee head S.R. Sekar said the plan was to identify volunteers to take forward the social media campaign in all 234 constituencies. \u201cWe will group the volunteers according to constituencies and have localised content. This way, we believe we could connect better with the voters and take up issues that affect them on a daily basis,\u201d he added. Referring to the widespread criticism of the Centre after the Dadri lynching episode, Ms. Lekhi said what was a mishandling of a law and order situation by the Uttar Pradesh State government quickly became a tool to bash the BJP. \u201cWe have to expose such misinformation,\u201d she said.\n\nJallikattu not political move\n\nAddressing a press conference later, Ms. Lekhi said revival of the popular bull taming sport, jallikattu was not a political move aimed at garnering votes. Rather, it was to ensure that the culture of Tamil Nadu was protected and sentiments of Tamils were respected. She said the suggestion of have observers from the Centre to ensure zero cruelty to animals would be considered and taken to the relevant authorities.\n\nParty holds first social media workshop to strengthen its campaign",
