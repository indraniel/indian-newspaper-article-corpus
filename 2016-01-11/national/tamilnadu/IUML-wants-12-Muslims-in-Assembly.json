Karunanidhi to ensure that at least 12 Muslim candidates were elected to the Assembly on behalf of the DMK alliance.\n\nIUML State president K.M. Kader Mohideen, who met Mr. Karunanidhi , also recalled the resolution adopted in the party\u2019s State conference, stressing the need for increasing the number of Muslim representatives.\n\n\u201cWe do not know who are all going to be the partners of the DMK alliance. Mr. Karunanidhi also told me that the alliance is yet to take shape,\u201d said Mr. Mohideen, who had invited the DMK leader and treasurer M.K. Stalin to take part its state-level Mahalas meeting to be held in Villupuram on March 10. Mr. Karunanidhi has expressed his inability to take part in the meeting. But Mr. Stalin will represent the DMK in the meeting to be attended by 11,000 representatives across the State.\n\nMr. Mohideen said if political parties were interested in defeating the AIADMK regime they should join hands with the DMK.",
