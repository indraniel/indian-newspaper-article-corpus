    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has directed Inspector General of Police (South Zone) to conduct an enquiry with respect to an alleged usurious money lender and his family members owning around 163 acres of dry land and buildings spread over 2.55 lakh square feet in and around Kariapatti and Panthalkudi in Virudhunagar district.\n\nDisposing of a petition filed by a borrower, Justice N. Kirubakaran ordered that the IG should complete the enquiry within 12 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the court order and forward his report to the Commissioner for Land Administration in Chennai for appropriate action under Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961.\n\nIt was in 2014 that the judge had directed Virudhunagar Deputy Superintendent of Police to probe into complaints of the moneylender, Immanuel, owning a large number of immovable properties in his name as well as in the name of his wife and son. Accordingly, the DSP found the allegations to be true on the basis of documents obtained from the Registration Department.\n\nExpressing shock over the revelation, the judge ordered for further action by the IG and directed the DSP to probe into a complaint lodged by the petitioner, K. Sundaram, against the moneylender and file a final report before the court concerned within two months. The petitioner had accused the usurer of demanding Rs.26 lakh in return for a loan of Rs.11 lakh besides taking away his properties.",
