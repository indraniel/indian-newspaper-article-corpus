However, before she could light herself up, a few officials and police overpowered her. She was taken to a police station. She said that though she had visited the Collectorate on many occasions demanding Old Age Pension, Widow Pension and other welfare assistance, no proper action had been taken on her petition. \u2014 Special Correspondent",
