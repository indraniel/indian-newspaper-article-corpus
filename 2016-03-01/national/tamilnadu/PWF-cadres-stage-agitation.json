Xavier, town secretary of MDMK, who led the agitation near Chidambara Nagar bus stop on Palayamkottai road, said people had been facing hardship owing to threefold increase in water tax. Hence, the tax should be reduced. Moreover, road users were having a tough time as most of the roads leading to residential localities, educational institutions and commercial establishments were in a bad shape.\n\nUnderground drainage work had not been completed and authorities should expedite the work, he said.\n\nR.S. Ramesh, district secretary, MDMK, K.S. Arjunan, district secretary, CPI (M), S. Alagumuthupandian, district secretary, CPI, Murasu Thamilappan, district secretary, VCK, and others took part.",
