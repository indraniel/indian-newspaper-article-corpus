Nagaraj said that the Government focussing on education and public health was also to be welcomed. He had also highlighted the announcements on budget medical shops, dialysis units in district head quarter hospitals and free cooking gas connection for below poverty line families to justify his welcoming the budget. However, the Union Finance Minister not increasing in the individual income tax ceiling was a disappointment, what with the prices of essential commodities increasing and monthly household expenditure going up, he also said.",
