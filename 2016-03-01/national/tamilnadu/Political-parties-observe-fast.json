    "text": "Stating that establishing new taluk office in Komarapalayam is against the Government Order, members of various political parties and traders observed a fast near bus stand in Pallipalayam here on Monday.\n\nRecently, the government announced that Tiruchengode taluk would be bifurcated to form Komarapalayam taluk with headquarters in Pallipalayam. However, traders and political parties in Komarapalayam protested against establishing the taluk office in Pallipalayam. Protest erupted in Pallipalayam when Minister for Industries and Transport P. Thangamani promised that the office would only be established in Komarapalayam. The Chief Minister through video conferencing inaugurated a temporary office at Komarapalayam. Political parties and traders in Pallipalayam announced that they would observe a fast on February 29 condemning it. Efforts by District Revenue Officer K. Palanisamy to withdraw their fast also failed on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, over 250 members observed a fast. They said that the new taluk office was very distant for villagers in Kokkarayanpettai, Anangoor, and Kadachanallur. When the Chief Minister had announced that the new office would function from Pallipalayam, the Minister and Collector V. Dakshinamoorthy had violated it and moved the office to Komarapalayam.",
