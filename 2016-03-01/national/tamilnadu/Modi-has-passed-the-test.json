    "text": "Whether he will score a centum will depend on how the announcements are implemented: Karunanidhi\n\nWelcoming the impetus given to agriculture and rural development in the budget, DMK president M. Karunanidhi, on Monday, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had \u201cpassed the examination\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr. Modi had termed the budget as the examination he was writing. Whether he will score a centum and get full victory will depend on how the announcements are implemented and the changes it creates. But I feel like saying in the current situation that he has passed the examination,\u201d the DMK president said.\n\nAppreciating the focus given to agriculture, in particular the proposal to double the per capita income of farmers in six years, he said the lack of change in income tax slabs was a disappointment to the middle class.\n\nMeanwhile, the reaction of DMDK president Vijayakant may put the BJP, which is trying to bring him into the NDA fold, in a spot.\n\n'Two sides of a coin'\n\n\u201cAs far as this budget is concerned, like two sides of a coin, it contains features that could be welcomed and criticised,\u201d he said.\n\nThe budget lacked announcements to fulfil the promise the Prime Minister made recently that the income of farmers would be doubled.\n\nThe absence of measures to deal with black money expeditiously was also disappointing, he said.\n\nPMK founder S. Ramadoss said that while he welcomed announcements in various sectors such as agriculture, health, education and rural development, the Centre should ensure the schemes did not remain on paper.\n\nBig disappointment\n\nTamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan said the budget did not satisfy the people.\n\nThe lack of any announcement on writing off farm debts was a big disappointment, Mr. Vasan said.\n\nVijayakant says budget has features that can be welcomed as well as criticised",
