    "text": "Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital has commenced treatment for the six-year-old boy, who is suffering from \u2018Harlequin ichthyosis\u2019, a severe genetic disorder that mainly affects the skin.\n\nInfants with this condition are born with very hard, thick skin covering most of their bodies. The skin forms large, diamond-shaped plates that are separated by deep cracks (fissures).\n\nAs K. Manthiramoorthy of Puttarathi Amman Temple Street in Tirunelveli Town is suffering from this disorder, his mother K. Uma Maheshwari brought him to the Collectorate and met Collector M. Karunakaran to explain her ordeals in finding the right treatment for him. When the Collector asked Dean of the TVMCH K. Sithy Athiya Munavarah to make arrangements for his treatment, the boy was admitted to the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis disorder, caused by gene mutation due to the marriage between first cousins or close relatives, is found in large numbers in Norway and Mediterranean Sea nations. The TVMCH has dealt with only three such cases in the past seven years,\u201d Dr. Munavarah told reporters here on Monday.\n\nThe Dean said that treatment had been started by experts from dermatology, ophthalmology, paediatrics, plastic surgery and neonatology departments. After undergoing treatment at the TVMCH as inpatient for about a week, the boy would be discharged and asked to come for treatment at regular intervals as preferred by the doctors.\n\nShe also said that special creams for this disorder had been brought from other places as instructed by Secretary, Department of Public Health, J. Radhakrishnan.\n\n\u201cThe boy will receive treatment under the Chief Minister\u2019s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme,\u201d she added.",
