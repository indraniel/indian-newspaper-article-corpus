    "text": "Mosquito breeding\n\nThe Department of Public Health has instructed all districts to take up biological methods to control mosquito breeding, especially of malaria vectors. The mosquito menace has attained very alarming proportions in Ramanathapuram town. Swarms of mosquitoes are seen both in day and night. Many open drains in the town are stagnant at many places, with foul smell emanating from them. This has resulted in Ramanathapuram becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes. I request the Commissioner of Ramanathapuram Municipality to use biological methods to tackle mosquito breeding by introducing fish species like Gambusia or Haplochilus and Barbus in waterbodies.\n\nG. Nagasamy,\n\nRamanathapuram\n\nHeritage sites\n\nMadurai district is having ancient archaeological sites such as Keelakuilkudi jain site, Thenparankundram Umaiyandavar temple, Yanaimalai Ladan temple, Arittapatti Siva cave temple, Varichur temple , Alagarmalai, Keezhavalavu, Tirupparankundram, Muthupatti and Mettupatti, which are not taken care of well. But these sites are now used by antisocials. These heritage sites have to be preserved.\n\nG. Chitti Babu,\n\nVelmurugan Nagar,\n\nMadurai",
