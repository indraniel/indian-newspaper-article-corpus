As the Vellore campus has a huge number of first year students of around 3,000, we took this to VIT, Chennai campus. A total of 860 first year students at Chennai campus have written the last two semester examinations on these tablets.\u201d\n\nUsing the IP address, the teachers would be able to access the answers from the Cloud.\n\n\u201cLaptops have been given to teachers.
