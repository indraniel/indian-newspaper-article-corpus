    "text": "A group of farmers from Melapanaiyur near Tirumayam has urged the district administration to take action to restore the irrigation facility for the Kannari sluice ayacutdars near Melapanaiyur. In a petition to the Collector S. Ganesh on Monday, they said that the ayacut with an extent of 21 hectares, had been plagued with a series of problems. They urged the Forest Department to desist from planting eucalyptus saplings in the area which has resulted in serious depletion of groundwater.\n\n\u201cRemove hoardings\u201d\n\nThe district administration has set a deadline of Tuesday for clearing all advertisement materials and hoardings across the district. The hoardings pertained to propaganda by political parties. Addressing representatives of parties at a meeting held here on Monday, T. Karikalan advised them to clear the same by 6 p.m. on Tuesday. \u201cIn case of any violation in adhering to the deadline, the district administration will take steps for clearing the same and recover the cost from the parties,\u201d he said. He said the administration has identified the hoardings and advertisement materials erected without valid permission. However, parties can obtain permission to set up hoardings by applying on line, he added.",
