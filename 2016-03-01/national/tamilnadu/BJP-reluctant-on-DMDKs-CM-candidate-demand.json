    "text": "While the DMDK is determined that its president Vijayakant will be the chief ministerial candidate to formalise an alliance, the BJP seems to be reluctant to accept the proposal.\n\nThe BJP leadership feels declaring a chief ministerial candidate in Tamil Nadu might lead to similar demands by allies in other States and may complicate its position.\n\n\u201cOur stakes are higher in many other States so we have to be very cautious in making such a decision in Tamil Nadu. This call will now be taken by national president Amit Shah,\u201d said a senior leader on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe party is certainly caught in a fix and has little space to manoeuvre. Not only is the DMDK making this demand, the other possible ally, PMK, has made the chief ministerial candidature of Anbumani Ramadoss non negotiable.\n\nNo compromises\n\n\u201cNobody wants to make compromises,\u201d the leader added. However, the party does not want to completely alienate all allies and isolate itself ahead of the polls\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the AIADMK has not opened any channel so far,\u201d said the functionary.\n\nMeanwhile, sources indicated that the party wants to conclude alliance talks by March second week when Mr. Shah is expected to attend a public rally in Tiruchi.",
