    "text": "Volunteers of the Popular Front of India on Monday took out a rally and staged a demonstration in front of the head post office demanding reservation for Muslims. The protestors marched from the Swadeshi Mills to the head post office.\n\nLeading the demonstration, Mohammed Sheik Ansari, general secretary of the Front, demanded the government to increase the quota to 4 per cent in proportion to the Muslim population which was 6.1 per cent as per the 2011 census.\n\nThough the government had announced reservation of 2 per cent for Muslims in the Union Territory in 2010, it was confined only to Group C posts and not Group B posts. Reservation should be fair and Muslims be treated on a par with other communities. Muslims were far behind in various fields and the government should increase the reservation for their uplift, he said.\n\nGovernment urged to increase the quota to 4 per cent in proportion to Muslim population",
