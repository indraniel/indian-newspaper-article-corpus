    "text": "The general budget was pro-rich, said M. Ahmed Hussein, regional secretary, National Confederation of Bank Employees, here on Monday.\n\nMr. Hussein said that the budget allocation of Rs. 70,000 crore to offset Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of the nationalised banks would help defaulters and not the poor.\n\nThe banks settled 1.96 lakh NPA accounts such as home loans, vehicle loans, personal loans, etc., through lok adalats across the country. The poor people obtained loans from banks were squeezed through these adalats, whereas the large borrowers were still at large, Mr. Hussein accused.\n\nKarungal R. George, district president, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peravai, said that the announcement on encouraging FDI in every sector, including retail trade, would affect the small and marginal traders. The peravai had been opposing FDI in retail trade for the last several years, he said. However, the peravai welcomed the announcement on opening of shops and business establishments seven days a week, Mr. George said.",
