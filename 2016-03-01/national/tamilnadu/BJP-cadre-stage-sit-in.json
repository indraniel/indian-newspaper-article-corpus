Kumar\n\nCadres of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday staged a sit-in before the Income Tax office in Thiruvalluvar Nagar demanding a thorough probe into the source of money for freebies distributed by parties in several constituencies. The protestors were led by V. Saminathan, president of Puducherry unit of the BJP. Mr. Saminathan said freebies included rice cookers, induction stoves, saris and dhotis. The IT department should keep a check on the source of money and expenditure of political parties engaged in distribution of the freebies, he added. \u201cThey should conduct surprise raids at godowns where these articles are stocked and initiate legal action if needed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe culture of distribution of freebies is unconstitutional and will undermine the spirit of democracy\u201d.",
