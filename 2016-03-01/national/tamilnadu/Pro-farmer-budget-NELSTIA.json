Being the country\u2019s largest sector providing employment to millions of workers, the move should improve farmers\u2019 living standards.\n\nHe said the proposal to establish 5,700 special institutions across the country for imparting special multi skills to youths would enable them to acquire employable qualities and skills. At the same time, he cautioned that the proposed schools should not be established in the Industrial Training Institute format.\n\nThe proposal to incorporate better facilities in 160 airports across India and Rs.2.18 lakh crore in the rail and road development sectors would infuse the much-needed vigour in the tourism and industrial sectors.\n\nThe reduction in corporate tax from existing 33 per cent to 24.80 per cent enthused entrepreneurs.\n\nHe welcomed the proposal of deferring the customs and excise duty declaration for exporters and importers with clean track record would provide some relief to them while encouraging others to maintain good track record.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we expected more incentives that can boost productivity in the small and tiny industries sector as it is also providing employment to several millions of skilled and unskilled labourers,\u201d Mr. Sanjay said.",
