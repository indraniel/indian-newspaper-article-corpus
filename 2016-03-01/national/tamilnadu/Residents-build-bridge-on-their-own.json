    "text": "Frustrated over their long-pending demand to build a bridge across a sewage channel not fructifying, about 300 residents of Balakrishnapuram of ward 3 started the construction work on their own on Monday.\n\nEach family in the ward contributed funds ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 and some offered their labour. They mobilised construction materials and started the work in the morning. Many did not go for work to help in constructing the temporary bridge across the 20-foot-wide channel that carried drainage water from Kullanampatti and nearby areas to Balakrishnapuram tank.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of appealing to panchayat and district administrations to build this bridge for the past four and a half years.\n\nStudents, workers and office-goers have to cross this channel to reach Dindigul city,\u201d said Sahaya Mary, a resident.\n\nThe channel had become a garbage dump and breeding ground for mosquitoes, posing a grave threat to the health of children, said Susai, another resident. Even basic civic facilities were not provided in their ward, he added.",
