Recently, it has hiked the rent and also the lease amount charges and passed resolution. Traders said that it is the only corporation in the country that had hiked the charges many fold times which is unreasonable. They said that the hike would affect the traders and shop keepers. \u201cWe did not get jobs or have money for investments. We borrowed money and run these shops\u201d, they added.\n\nShopkeepers said the hike would leave them to spent major portion of their earnings for rent and bear only loss in business. \u201cIt is injustice to raise the charges that we cannot pay or bear\u201d, they added. They said that 1,500 families are directly benefitted by the shops. They later submitted a petition to the Mayor S. Soundappan.",
