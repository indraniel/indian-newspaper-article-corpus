Sadananda Gowda on Friday called on the family of Shabana Taj, who died last Sunday after being knocked down by a car driven by a Sudanese student.\u2014Photo : Sudhakara Jain.\n\nUnion Law Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Friday accused the State government of not acting tough against foreigners who are staying illegally in Bengaluru after the expiry of their visa. He said that the law and order situation in the city had deteriorated so much that people are afraid to walk out at night.\n\nHe alleged that some students from abroad are guilty of \u2018illegal activities\u2019 and \u2018rowdyism\u2019 instead of using the facilities for their betterment. \u201cThis is intolerable.\u201d\n\nHe made these allegations after stepping out of the house of Shabana Taj, who lost her life in the hit-and-run incident on Sunday, which prompted a mob to attack a Tanzanian female student and her friends on Sunday.\n\nReferring to the attack, he said, \u201cLocals are being harassed by the police.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nWhen people took offence to his statements, the minister took to Twitter to clarify his stand saying that he condemned both the accident and the attack on the student and her friends.\n\nSoladevanahalli, where the two incidents took place, comes under Mr. Gowda\u2019s constituency.\n\nArrested man\u2019s mother waits to meet Minister\n\nThe mother of Lokesh, who is among those arrested for the mob attack, was waiting near Mr. Gowda\u2019s car outside Ms. Taj\u2019s house to have a word with the minister.\n\nLokesh is a BJP worker and a member of the local gram panchayat. But she did not get to meet the Minister because she started feeling dizzy and had to be taken to a hospital.",
