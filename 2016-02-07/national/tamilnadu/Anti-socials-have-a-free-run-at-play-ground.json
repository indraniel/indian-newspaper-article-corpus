    "text": "Every evening, when Azeez goes to play football at the Corporation playground on Naval Hospital Road, Vepery, he first removes pieces of broken alcohol bottles on the ground and then start playing.\n\nThe ground, situated in ward 58 of Chennai Corporation, has been in the locality for over five years now. However, many anti-social elements used to roam around the ground, making it impossible for women and children to walk past the play area.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, we organised a road-roko demanding that the Chennai Corporation fix a proper gate and lights for the ground. Finally, a gate was fixed on Friday and powerful lights were installed,\u201d said A.V. Afroze Ahmeed, chairman, Central Chennai, District Congress Committee (minority department).\n\nDue to this, children have started using the playground in the evenings.\n\n\u201cIt is a nice way to prevent the future generation from getting into crime. However, the anti-social elements still find a way to get into the ground and use a small room on the premises as a cover for their acts,\u201d added Afroze.\n\nMany residents claim they enter the ground by jumping over the compound wall of a building behind the ground.\n\n\u201cIt houses some commercial establishments and apartments. The youngsters who drink and smoke weed at the ground throw stones at the houses and create a ruckus,\u201d said Vinod, a teenager who plays football at the ground.\n\nThe liquor bottles are also broken and thrown on the ground. \u201cChildren playing here get injured after stepping on them. They also get introduced to tobacco products as they start sniffing the leftover cigarettes,\u201d added Vinod.\n\nMany residents say police patrolling should be increased in the locality. \u201cThough the patrol vehicles come inside the streets, people still drink and smoke ganja in the open. When they see the patrol vehicle, they hide,\u201d he said. Police personnel said that they would look into the issue.\n\nWoman attacked\n\nWorsening the fear of the residents are the recent attacks on an elderly woman in the locality twice this month.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, an unknown person wearing a helmet came into the house and attacked my mother, K. Premakumari, and snatched her gold chain. She sustained cut injuries on her neck and shoulders,\u201d said K. Venkatraman, her son who resides at 12th street, Naval Hospital Road. On Saturday again, a similar-looking man barged into the house.\n\n\u201cThis time, before he could snatch my mother\u2019s chain, she raised an alarm and he fled the house after slitting her hands with a blade,\u201d he added.\n\nThe police have registered a case and are investigating.",
