    "text": "The much-awaited inauguration of the Regional Judicial Academy at Race Course in the city is expected to be on the 21st of this month.\n\nIt was earlier said that the building might be inaugurated in mid-2013. But, it was delayed for several reasons.\n\nConstruction of the four-storied building at an estimated Rs. 8.5 crore began in 2011. In a campus sprawling about two acres the total built-up area is 70,000 sq.ft. But the completion of the building was delayed due to financial constraints and it has been completed over a period of five years after additional funds were sanctioned.\n\nThis will become the first-ever judicial academy outside Chennai and works are on for constructing a similar one at Madurai.\n\nThe academy coming up here will benefit sub-ordinate judiciary officers in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. They need not travel all the way to Chennai for training programmes.\n\nThe building has a library, rooms for training visiting judicial officers and lawyers, conference hall, auditorium and chambers for the Director and Deputy Directors. It will be useful for conducting induction training programmes for the officers entering the sub-ordinate judiciary and those who are about to be elevated.\n\nSimilarly, Public Prosecutors, Special Public Prosecutors and Government Pleaders will also go through training programmes on induction.\n\nSources said that in addition, the academy would also be useful for conducting mid-career and in-service refresher training programmes.",
