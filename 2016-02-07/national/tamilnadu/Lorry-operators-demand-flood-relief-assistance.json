Krishnaswamy\n\nLorry operators in the city who are yet to recover from the impact of the recent floods have sought flood relief assistance to be provided soon. Members of the Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners Federation complained that the industry was already affected by various issues such as exorbitant toll rates, fuel price hike and increasing cost of spare parts.\n\nThough the lorry operators had reported the heavy loss incurred during the recent floods, both the State and Central governments were yet to provide any assistance, said its president R. Sugumar. \u201cWhenever crude oil prices go up, the government also implements a diesel price hike. But, in the recent months, the price of crude oil has been dipping drastically. Petroleum companies have not reduced the rate in tune with the drop in the crude oil cost,\u201d he said.\n\nPointing out that excise duty had been increased by Rs.12 per litre in the past two years, members of the federation said the government had steadily hiked the excise duty and this kept fuel prices high for customers.\n\nThe federation also submitted a representation to the Union Ministry of Surface Transport seeking a decrease in fuel price and flood relief assistance.",
