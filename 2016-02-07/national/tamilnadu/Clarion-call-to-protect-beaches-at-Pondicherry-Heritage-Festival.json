The erosion has damaged the ecological function and services. Building sea walls with rocks is not the solution to the problem. It requires at least Rs. 13 to Rs. 15 crore in a year for dredging,\u201d he added.\n\nSand beaches protect people from cyclones, big waves and prevent ground water from becoming saline. It supports the livelihood of fishermen and provides better space for recreation. The erosion of sand in Puducherry was man-made.\n\n\u201cWe had begun a campaign to restore the sand beach in 1999 under the aegis of Pondicherry Citizens Forum. Slowly, we invited people and experts, after many years we got the government to understand and accept that the main cause is the harbour. It was in 2010 that the government decided to fix the problem. Over the last two to three years, they have started making studies to restore the beach. It has been a long drawn affair,\u201d he said.\n\nDue to unscientific planning, the country has lost at least 40 per cent of sand beaches.\n\nDr. M.V. Ramana Murthy, scientist at National Institute of Ocean Technology, said that man-made developments of ports, damming of rivers and dredging of tidal inlets have led to erosion. \u201cBesides implementation of short-term strategies for immediate protection, there needs to be long term plans to protect the sand beaches,\u201d he said.\n\nNithyanand Jayaram, environmentalist from Chennai spoke about the government\u2019s apathy in protecting the natural resources.\n\nThe Pondicherry Heritage Festival, co-hosted by INTACH, The People for Pondicherry\u2019s Heritage and PondyCAN, with the support of a host of government departments, will conclude on Sunday.",
