    "text": "The wives of some knitwear entrepreneurs in Tirupur decided that they would take an initiative to clean up their city instead of solely depending on officials to do so.\n\nThe piled up garbage at the Tirupur knitwear cluster has considerably dented the city\u2019s image.\n\nThe women\u2019s collective is now into segregation and disposal of wet and dry wastes generated both in their households and on the textile units/ commercial establishment premises.\n\nNamed SWAN (Sripuram Women's Active Network), the movement now has 100 women, mostly wives of industrialists.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to widen the base and rope in every household of industrialists in Tirupur cluster into this effort. We will go further out in the second phase of our drive,\u201d said, Saradha Devi, coordinator of SWAN.\n\nExplaining the project, Mrs. Devi said that while the women would use the wet wastes for composting, the dry wastes would be taken away for disposal by a company that SWAN has tied up with.\n\nThe SWAN as a consortium collectively procures \u2018decomposing bags,\u2019 needed to convert wet wastes into manure. Three such bags will be distributed to each household.\n\n\u201cThe manure produced from the wet wastes will be used by the member women for their garden and farms. If we can\u2019t use all of it, SWAN will sell the same to farm owners and generate revenue that will fund the operational costs of the Movement,\u201d explained Mrs. Devi.",
