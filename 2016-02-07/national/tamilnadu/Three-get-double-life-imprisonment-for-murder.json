    "text": "First Additional District Judge M. Jothiraman has sentenced three persons to double life imprisonment for murdering a youth in 2014.\n\nThe prosecution case was that Kumar (55), of Ayyan Thirumaligai was working as Sarasthar in the district court. His son, Yuvaraj (27), married to Venkatalakshmi, was supplying packaged drinking water to households.\n\nOn June 11, 2014, Yuvaraj and his wife went for a walk in Gorimedu. Three persons, \u2018Kozhi\u2019 Prakash, Manikandan and Sathish alias Sathish Kumar, attacked Yuvaraj with a knife near a Tasmac outlet. Yuvaraj died on the spot.\n\nKannankurichi police registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) r/w 334 (voluntarily causing hurt on provocation) of IPC and arrested the three. Inquiries revealed that when Prakash was not in the house, Yuvaraj sought money from Prakash\u2019s wife for the water cans supplied. This angered Prakash, who questioned Yuvaraj and altercation broke between them. Hence, he along with two accomplices hatched a plan and murdered Yuvaraj.\n\nWhen the case was in trial, the three accused moved the Madras High Court seeking transfer of the case to another court as Yuvaraj\u2019s father was working in the district court.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, the Madras High Court dismissed their petition. The judge handed over double life imprisonment for murder and hatching criminal conspiracy and levied a fine of Rs. 2,000 each. Also, the judge handed over three years imprisonment and levied fine of Rs. 500 for threatening the public at the crime spot. Their sentences will run concurrently.",
