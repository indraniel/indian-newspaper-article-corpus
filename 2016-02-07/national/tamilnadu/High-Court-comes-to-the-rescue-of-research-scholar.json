Hariparanthaman said the order passed by the university on October 1 directing the petitioner to abstain from attending research and other related activities and restricting his presence on the campus was against the Centre\u2019s aim of providing higher education opportunities to minorities.\n\nThe judge pointed out that the petitioner, a Senior Research Fellow pursuing his doctorate in the Department of Criminology of MSU, had claimed to have made applications under the Right to Information Act, 2005 to the university seeking details of fund transactions of a particular organisation and alleged illegal absorption of Assistant Professors in the varsity.\n\nSubsequently, he also supported a group of women students who levelled sexual harassment charges against an Assistant Professor. As an aftermath, another teaching faculty member of the university lodged a police complaint on September 25 accusing the petitioner of having threatened him on September 1 and this turned out to be the reason for the suspension.\n\nWondering why the complainant waited for 25 days to approach the police and pointing out that a lawyer\u2019s notice issued by the complainant to the petitioner, prior to registration of FIR, does not state anything about the alleged incident that took place on September 1, the judge said: \u201cFor all the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the FIR itself has to be viewed with suspicion.\u201d Further, the judge said the university\u2019s decision to suspend the petitioner \u201cwas opposed to formulations of the Government of India with regard to inclusiveness of minorities in higher education.\u201d",
