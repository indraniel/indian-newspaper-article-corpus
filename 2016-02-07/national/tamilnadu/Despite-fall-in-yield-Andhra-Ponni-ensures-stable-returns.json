Karuppan, a farmer in Kumara Vayalur, said he had raised the paddy variety on about four acres of land.\n\nAthough he could harvest just 40 bags an acre, about four or five bags short of his usual harvest, he was happy over the prospective rate and assured market for the crop. \u201cBrokers have been making a beeline to Kumara Vayalur for the past one week, demanding for the BPT 5204 variety,\u201d he said indicating the assured market for the produce.\n\nThe brokers have fixed the price at Rs. 1,250 a bag of 62 kg each and will directly visit the fields to buy the grain.\n\nHe said good northeast monsoon had enabled the growth of paddy this season.",
