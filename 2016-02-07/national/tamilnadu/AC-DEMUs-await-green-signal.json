DEMUs are operated as suburban trains connecting smaller towns to Metros across the Indian Railway and there has been a consistent demand from commuters to introduce AC coaches.\n\nThough two rakes were rolled out long ago, they were parked in the Tondiarpet yard for several months awaiting tariff structure from the Railway Board and clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, railway sources said. A DEMU with AC coaches was flagged off by the Minster of Railways last year at Ernakulam in Southern Railway, but was discontinued.\n\n\u201cSince we had two DEMU rakes with AC coaches, it was proposed to operate them in the Chennai-Puducherry and Puducherry-Tirupati sectors. The rakes were later moved to the Northern Railway,\u201d said a railway official who did not want to be quoted.\n\nThe cost of each DEMU rake with AC coaches is around Rs. 25 crore and four rakes rolled out of ICF since 2014 are pending approval for operations, the sources added.",
