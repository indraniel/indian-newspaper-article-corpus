    "text": "GREEN initiative to beautify the city\n\nAt a recent Swachh Bharat meeting, Corporation officials and representatives of corporate companies were busy discussing on how best to use Corporate Social Responsibility funds for toilet construction. After a few participants got their doubts cleared, a political party representative asked if his leader's picture would be displayed on the constructed toilet wall. Corporation officials diplomatically responded that all official logos and pictures would be used.\n\nBy mid week there is every possibility that people travelling the stretch between Ukkadam and Aathupalam will be greeted with a median that is bristling with greenery. C. Kishore of MC3 an NGO says, \u201cWe are going to plant 3,500 crotons along the median in this two km stretch as part of a city beautification project.\u201d The initiative is a joint one between MC3, the National Highways and Zimson watches that is doing it as its CSR initiative. Zimson will also take care of the maintenance of the crotons.\n\n\u201cWe will plant the first 500 saplings and the rest will be planted with the help of gardeners. We hope this will encourage others to come forward and take up similar city beautification drives,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nKarthik Madhavan, and Pankaja Srinivasan)",
