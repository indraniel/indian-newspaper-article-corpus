    "text": "Students from various schools in Madurai and neighbouring districts descended on Tamukkam Grounds here on Saturday for the aero exhibition, \u201cAeroplus 2016,\u201d organised by Coimbatore-based Nehru Group of Institutions.\n\nTwo small helicopters and three small aircraft were on display at the exhibition which is being organised by the group for the first time in Madurai. \u201cThe Aeroplus exhibition was started more than 20 years ago. Until last year, we were conducting it only on our college campus in Kuniamuthur in Coimbatore district. This is the first time we have ventured out,\u201d said R. Moses Daniel, convener of the exhibition and Principal of Nehru Institute of Engineering and Technology.\n\nStating that one of the reasons was the increasing number of students from southern districts taking up aeronautics in their college, he added that it was also to create an interest in aircraft among children. \u201cWe were all fascinated by aeroplanes when we were young. Here, we are allowing the children to enter one of the aircraft and see how the controls work,\u201d he said.\n\nS. Preethi, a second-year student from the college, who is also part of the organising committee, said that the efforts they had put in had paid off as the exhibition was attracting a large number of children. The organisers claimed that the three-day exhibition that started on Friday saw more than 20,000 visitors.\n\nK. Akash Kannan, a VIII student from a school, said that he was thrilled to enter the aircraft for the first time. \u201cBut I thought that they will fly the aircraft in the show. I am a little disappointed that it did not happen,\u201d he said.",
