    "text": "Sumitha, wife of Ramamoorthy, and Nanje Gowdu, his father, are entirely dependent on agriculture for survival.\n\nThis May, Sumitha would have celebrated her fourth wedding anniversary, if only 28-year-old Ramamoorthy had escaped the avalanche in Siachen. All of 22-years old, Sumitha is now a soldier\u2019s widow.\n\nOnly that Ramamoorthy was a husband she barely knew. In the three-and-a-half years they were married, he had visited his village Gudisaadhanapalli only twice, thanks to his posting in the armed forces.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to retire after 58 years, and he was obsessed with the Army,\u201d says Sumitha in Telugu. He called the Tuesday before last and the call lasted less than five minutes.\n\n\u201cHe said there was a long line of jawans waiting to talk to their families. But, he promised he would come in two months time,\u201d says Sumitha. Now, she is unsure if even his body would ever arrive.\n\nSitting by his daughter-in-law, Nanje Gowdu, the severely diabetic 55-year-old father of Ramamoorthy, breaks down often. \u201cI wanted him to join the Army so that all of us could have a better life.\u201d The obedient son joined the Army at the age of 20, and held on to it out of his own love for it and his country.\n\nFor the family, Ramamoorthy\u2019s joining the Army was more of a survival choice, to eke out a living away from the bone-dry landscape of Gudisaadhanapalli.\n\nToday, the family\u2019s only possession is 1.5 acres of land, which is jointly cultivated by his father and uncle.\n\n\u201cThis year the ragi crop was better due to the rains. In a normal year, there is only drought,\u201d says Ramakrishna Gowdu, Ramamoorthy\u2019s uncle and the sarpanch.\n\nIt was an SSLC-educated Ramamoorthy\u2019s earnings that shouldered the entire familyDistraught at the premature death of his son, for Nanje Gowdu, equally singeing is the silence of the district administration.\n\n\u201cNot one person has called or visited us. The Collector never called to enquire. It was like nothing ever happened, even as my son died while guarding the country.\u201d This father\u2019s son, died without issue of his own.\n\nNanje Gowdu, looking aged beyond his years, has another worry. \u201cMy son used to take me to the Airforce Command hospital in Bengaluru. I wonder if I could still avail the treatment,\u201d he says.",
