It\u2019s even quite cathartic in much the same way one finds dark pleasure in the implosion of skyscrapers. Never before have I heard such deafening silence when an actor delivers a punch line.\n\nYou can almost hear crickets chirp each time. The camera often lingers over a smirking Prashanth, if only so the audience can appreciate his \u2018boyish good looks\u2019. We often keep hearing big actors complain about how they get pigeonholed into similar characters and films because their fans demand a certain kind of film from them. Why then would Prashanth, who isn\u2019t burdened by stardom, need to make such a crowd-pleaser? With all the financial clout (the film was apparently shot in three countries) and the acting talent at the film\u2019s disposal (cast includes Sonu Sood, Nassar, M. S. Bhaskar, Thambi Ramaiah, and Robo Shankar), couldn\u2019t the makers have been free to make any film they wanted? Doesn\u2019t a film\u2019s screenplay not deserve a bigger budget than the hero\u2019s shoes?\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible for us to invest in Ravi\u2019s (Prashanth) character because the writer (Thiagarajan) doesn\u2019t seem to have either. Ravi is a wastrel, who at any given time seems capable of predicting every move of a criminal mastermind, while casually solving a Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\nIt\u2019s almost ironic that in a film that\u2019s already so empty and predictable, we have a hero who can predict exactly how events are going to unfold. It\u2019s like we are watching each predictable scene, twice. Take, for instance, the scene where Ravi needs to catch up to a villain during a car chase. Not only do we have to see this tacky action scene unfold once, but we also have to see a comical animated graph emerge from the hero\u2019s head showing him calculate the distance, speed and time required for him to drive his car through a glass building to surpass the bad guy.\n\nAnd when he isn\u2019t shooting down kidnappers while sucking on a lollipop, he is busy breaking into duets with the heroine in exotic locations.\n\nOne can only watch in disbelief as the actor dances in colour-coordinated clothing, pretending that not a day has passed since the 1990s when he was called \u2018Top Star\u2019.\n\nYou wish some of the character\u2019s ability to predict events had rubbed off on the actor himself\u2026 the fate of this film would have been obvious.\n\nvishal menon\n\nSaagasam\n\nGenre:Action\n\nCast:Prashanth, Amanda, Nassar, John Vijay\n\nDirector:Arun Raj Varma\n\nStoryline:An unlikely hero helps the police recover a large sum of money",
