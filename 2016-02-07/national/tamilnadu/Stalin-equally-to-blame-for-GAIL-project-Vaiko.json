Addressing a press conference at MDMK\u2019s headquarters on Saturday, he accused both the parties of institutionalising corruption.\n\nPWF leaders Thol. Thirumavalavan (VCK), G. Ramakrishnan (CPI-M) and Mutharasan (CPI) are preparing to address public meetings scheduled for February 7, 8 and 9 in delta regions.\n\nMr. Vaiko criticised DMK leader Stalin and the erstwhile DMK government for giving consent to the Gail project. \u201cThe project was given a go-ahead by Mr. Stalin when he was Deputy Chief Minister. He has a lot to answer and so does the Bharatiya Janata Party which is consistently going against the interests of Tamils,\u201d Mr. Vaiko said.",
