Ramadoss has said that the State government must not appoint candidates to fill the vacant Vice-Chancellor slots in eight universities, including Madras University, across Tamil Nadu.\n\n\u201cThere have been reports that corruption and fraud are a part and parcel of these appointments, which are disconcerting. It\u2019s clear that if the rules and regulations of the University Grants Commission are not properly followed, fraud is bound to take place in these appointments,\u201d he said in a statement here on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe State government knows this very well and it is bent on not following the rules. With educationist Mu. Ananthakrishnan already fighting a case in the Madras High Court and the verdict expected in a few days' time, the State government must not fill any spots in the mean time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Fraud is bound to take place if UGC rules and regulations are not properly followed\u2019",
