    "text": "Courier counters in Delhi stations trigger idea\n\nIn the future, commuters of Chennai Metro Rail may be able to collect their parcels from e-commerce sites at the stations itself.\n\nOfficials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) said they were considering setting up counters for e-commerce sites at the stations, as part of property development plans.\n\n\u201cWe found that the idea of having courier counters will be happening soon in Delhi Metro Rail stations and hence we too have considered this plan. It will definitely be part of our stations but this may take some more time here,\u201d an official said.\n\nThey noted that this might be implemented in a full-fledged way once the entire 45-km stretch of the Chennai Metro Rail service became operational.\n\n\u201cIt would make sense to have it when the operations begin in a full swing. This would also attract more commuters to our stations, which will enhance safety,\u201d he added.\n\nThe first Metro Rail service between Koyambedu and Alandur, a distance of 10 km, was commissioned only in July last.\n\nIn a few months, the next stretch from Little Mount to Chennai airport may also be launched.\n\nThe initiative is expected to attract more commuters to stations, in turn enhancing safety",
