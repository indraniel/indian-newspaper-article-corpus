Ramaswamy seeking to declare Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2011 (Act 2) as violative of the Constitution of India.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, as per the amended section 326 BB of the Act, to install digital banners which have to be kept for more than six days it is enough to get the permission of the District Collector.\n\nThis has led to a situation where those keeping digital banners encroaching roads cannot be questioned by officials or any other person, Mr. Ramaswamy said.\n\nAs an interim relief, the petitioner sought the court to direct the government authorities concerned to prevent erection of hoardings in public roads pending disposal of the petition.",
