Palaniappan, president of the society. The group has been making the sarees since 2007 by uniting weavers, whose forefathers were instrumental in bringing out the \u2018Kandangi silk sarees\u2019 patronised by the \u2018Nattukottai Nagarathars,\u2019 the wealthiest community in the region, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have used the designs and colour combinations of Kandangi sarees to produce the Chettinad cotton sarees,\u201d Mr. Palaniappan told The Hindu . The brand and logo would help the society to promote its sales in the domestic as well as international markets.\n\nThe sarees are already popular in New Delhi and Mumbai and countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, he said.\n\nThe procedure for the branding began in October last year when the weavers service centre in Chennai and the textiles committee in Madurai made a site inspection followed by inspection of looms and interaction with weavers, Mr. Palaniappan said. About 650 weavers attached to three societies in the region produced the sarees, he added.",
