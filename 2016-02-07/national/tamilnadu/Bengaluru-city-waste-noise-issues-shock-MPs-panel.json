    "text": "The city\u2019s burning issues of traffic, garbage and pollution apparently raised a stink when the visiting Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment and Forests met the Chief Minister, State officials and NGOs here on Thursday.\n\nPanel chairman Ashwani Kumar expressed shock at the ineffective working of the State Pollution Control Board.\n\nHe said that the Parliamentarians were dismayed by the poor state of air and noise quality due to the city\u2019s heavy vehicular traffic and poor handling of solid and biomedical waste. The Chief Minister has been urged to address all these and other environmental concerns of the city, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking to know that Bengaluru alone has about 9,000 clinical establishments but only three service providers to handle their biomedical waste, which is a health hazard. We have requested authorities to submit an action plan on collection and ways to deal with it,\u201d Dr. Ashwani Kumar told a news conference here.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed and aghast to note that till date no effective enforcement measures seem to have been taken by the Pollution Control Board against those guilty of violating environmental norms. We learn that 211 prosecutions were launched but not one resulted in sentencing or even a fine. We have asked the [PCB] to come out with proposals to amend and make the law more effective,\u201d the MP and former Union Minister said.\n\nStating that environment will be the nation\u2019s biggest challenge after terrorism, Dr. Ashwani Kumar said the city's drinking water and its polluted and dying lakes were also discussed.\n\nInstead of dumping garbage in the villages around it, the city should find the right way of disposing it, he said.",
