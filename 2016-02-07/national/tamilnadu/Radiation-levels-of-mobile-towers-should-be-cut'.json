    "text": "Stating that the current level of radiation (electromagnetic field, EMF) emitted by mobile phone towers was still high, Girish Kumar, Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, on Saturday, urged the Centre to reduce the radiation level further.\n\nThe mobile tower radiation had been reduced from 45,000 milli watt per square metre to 450 milli watt a few years ago. It should be reduced to 10 milli watt, he said while addressing the students of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National institute of Technology-T, on the occasion of technical symposium\u2019s (PROBE 2016) inauguration.\n\nMr. Kumar said mobile phone technology had revolutionised the telecommunication scenario in the country. It had more than 90 crore mobile phones and 5 lakh mobile towers. There was no doubt that it had made communication cheap and easy. But not many know the health risks associated with the radiation emitted from mobile towers and mobile phones. Many counties, including Australia, Sweden, and Russia had brought the EMF level down to a great extent. Several other countries had taken steps to bring down the level.\n\nThere was a need to create awareness among the people on safe use of mobile phones and towers. Mr. Kumar said people restrict use of mobile phones and lengthy conversations should be avoided.\n\nHe said the State and the Centre should make compulsory the service providers and handset makers to carry slogans against extensive use of mobiles.\n\nD. Deivamoney Selvam, Director-In-Charge, NIT-T, D. Sriram Kumar, B. Venkataramani, and S. Raghavan, Professors, speak.",
