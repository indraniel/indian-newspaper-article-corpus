Have you heard of an appreciation line whereby, as the name suggests, good service is appreciated.\n\nFor autorickshaw drivers in city, an appreciation line will be launched on Sunday to enable customers to register their appreciation for any driver who could have done some exemplarily good deed.\n\nThe new initiative of Auto Anna Welfare Trust, which will be launched along with Lions Club of Meenambakkam, will help recognise auto drivers who abide by the metering system and are customer-friendly.\n\n\u201cBehaviour of autorickshaw drivers in the city are being much discussed since 2013 when the fares were revised. We wanted to change the perception about drivers,\u201d said Anil Khicha, who started the trust.\n\nTo kick-start the initiative, the trust will honour 16 \u2018auto heroes\u2019 on Sunday in recognition of their goodwill gestures.\n\nGoodwill votes\n\nWhile some have returned jewels and other belongings of customers, a few others have spent their own money for providing medical treatment to travellers.\n\n\u201cWe want this initiative to grow. All a customer has to do is text the vehicle number of the autorickshaw driver who was courteous, to our appreciation line (9243000111). The vote will be registered and the drivers with most number of goodwill votes will be awarded every month,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trust will also distribute 5,000 stickers on the initiative.\n\nIt will recognise auto drivers who abide by metering system and are customer-friendly",
