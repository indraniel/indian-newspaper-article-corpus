    "text": "Members of Tamizhaga Makkal Jananayaka Katchi staged a demonstration in front of the Vendipalayam dump yard on Thursday demanding its relocation, cautioning it was saturated, and that further dumping would lead to catastrophic consequences.\n\nAbout 50 protestors led by the district unit president of the party Mohammed Shahjahan slammed the corporation for not doing enough to identify alternative location for the dump yard for the last three years.\n\nOf the over 300 tonnes of garbage generated every day, 250 tonnes find their way to Vendipalayam and the remaining is dumped at Vairapalayam compost yard.\n\nThe garbage is being accumulated vertically, and lorries have to empty the wastes by dangerously driving on the garbage, Mr. Shahjahan said, adding that people in neighbourhood localities have stopped relying on borewells as the ground water has turned brackish.\n\nA long-term solution could be found by either splitting the garbage at different points by starting garbage dumps at new locations or by shifting the garbage dump altogether to a distant location away, Mr. Shahjahan said.\n\nOn a periodic basis, the garbage is set on fire and it then takes weeks for extinguishing the flames.\n\nIn the wake of a fire in the garbage dump last year, the corporation had sought expertise from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre to recycle the wastes. But, there has been no progress on this front.",
