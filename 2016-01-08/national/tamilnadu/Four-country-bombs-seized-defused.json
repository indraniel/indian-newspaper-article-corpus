Madhavan and Inspector of Police Thillai Nagarajan.\n\nImediately, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad rushed to the spot and defused the explosives that were reportedly of \u201clow intensity\u201d.\n\nAround 3.30 p.m. on Wednesday, Police Control Room here received an anonymous call, and the caller warned that bombs planted in Perumal temples in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai would go off shortly. While a police team tried to establish the identity of the caller, who had made the call from a coin-box phone in Tirunelveli Town, six teams were involved in checking Perumal temples in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai. \u201cIt was a hoax call. We did not find any explosives during the search,\u201d said a police officer.",
