    "text": "The overall revenue from liquor sold through 253 Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) outlets operated by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) in Tirupur district has jumped from Rs. 1,267 crore registered in 2014 (calender year) to Rs. 1,477 crore in 2015.\n\nThe quantum leap in the sales is worrying the medical fraternity as the doctors are of the opinion that liquor consumption could affect the quality of workforce over a period of time.\n\nThe business graph in the liquor sales from the district shows that it was a steady increase year after year since the district was carved out from Erode and Coimbatore. The sales revenue from the IMFL in the district was Rs. 732.9 crore in 2009.\n\nTasmac sources told The Hindu that the lion\u2019s share of revenue in 2015 came from the nearly 100 outlets functioning in Tirupur Corporation limits.\n\n\u201cAround 80 per cent of revenue has come from the sale of brandy followed by sales of rum, whisky and wine in the descending order,\u201d said officials.\n\nBeer sales, however, came down by nine per cent in 2015 vis-a-vis 2014.\n\nThe sales has increased despite many awareness campaigns conducted during 2015 by various organisations with the aim of bringing down the liquor sales as it had started creating social and economic problems in society.\n\nP. Ravichandran, former president of Indian Medical Association (Tirupur chapter), says that awareness campaigns on the ill-effects of liquor consumption should start from the school and only then the desired results could be achieved.",
