It is expected that except State Bank of India, the banking operations in other commercial banks including the associate banks of SBI will be affected on Friday, the sources said.\n\nBanking operations would be hit in over 100 branches and over 1,000 bank employees were expected to take part in the strike.\n\nThe AIBEA has planned to stage a demonstration in front of the regional office of the State Bank of Travancore near Head Post Office in Nagercoil on Friday, the sources said.",
