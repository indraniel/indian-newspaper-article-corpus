    "text": "Micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) have sought financial support from the Union Government for the growth of the sector.\n\nAt a recent meeting here with Union Minister for MSMEs Kalraj Mishra, the micro units said they need loans at lower interest rate. The banks should lend to MSMEs at 7 per cent interest and should restructure loans for units that are unable to repay the credit. The Centre should open MUDRA Bank branch in Coimbatore and also take steps to start a public sector undertaking here, they said.\n\nCoimbatore District Small Industries Association president E.K. Ponnuswamy said the Centre should provide depreciation benefits to MSMEs. In several sectors, the units go in for new machinery and invest huge amount to have new technologies. They should be provided depreciation benefits so that such investments are viable.",
