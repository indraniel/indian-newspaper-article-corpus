It plans to complete the project by March 31.\n\nThe solar panels and other equipment are in place and they have already started generating about 200 to 250 MW of power, sources said. The company has handed over about 50 acres of land to Tangedco for setting up two sub stations for transmitting power. Tangedco wanted to complete construction of sub stations at the earliest but the rains and floods have delayed the work, the sources said. By the time they complete the 400/230/110 KV sub stations, the company would be in a position to make available the full capacity of 648 MW of power to Tangedo, the sources added.",
