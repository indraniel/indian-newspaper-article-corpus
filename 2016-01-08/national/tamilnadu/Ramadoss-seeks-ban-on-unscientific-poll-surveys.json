    "text": "Charging that motivated opinion polls were hurting the level playing ground for political parties in elections, PMK founder S. Ramadoss, on Thursday, urged the Centre and the Election Commission of India to legally ban unscientific surveys.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Ramadoss alleged two opinion surveys released since August in Tamil Nadu were clearly rigged to help a particular political party.\n\nWhile usually only one person is named as the chief ministerial candidate of a party which is doing the survey, these polls chose two from a particular outfit. This exposes the hands behind the polls.\n\nMr. Ramadoss said while such surveys were viewed as part of freedom of expression, the manner in which organisations sprout as elections nears and do unscientific surveys end up imposing false opinions on the electorate. While big surveys based on scientific approach could, to an extent, gauge the mood of the public, even large organisations hold back from doing such surveys given the cost involved.\n\nTherefore, he urged the ECI and the Centre to enact a law to ban all unscientific opinion polls which have become detrimental to democracy.\n\n\u2018Motivated opinion polls hurting level playing ground for political parties in elections\u2019",
