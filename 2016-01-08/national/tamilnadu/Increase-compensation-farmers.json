    "text": "The Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam has urged the state government to increase the compensation for crops damaged during the North East monsoon.\n\nIn a resolution adopted at its state executive meeting held here on Thursday, it said the relief announced by the state government was far below the expenditure incurred by the farmers for raising the crop.\n\nThe relief per hectare for paddy was just Rs.13,500 but the Sangam demanded at least Rs.25,000 an acre.\n\nAnother resolution wanted the government to announce Rs.4,000 per tonne as minimum support price for sugarcane. The Centre has announced Fair Remunerative Price of Rs.2,300, the resolution said urging the state government to announce its advisory price.\n\nThe meeting, through another resolution, urged the government to sanction adequate relief to the bereaved families of farmers who were killed in police firing during the course of various agitations. In this context, the resolution referred to the poll promise made by the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\nS.A. Chinnasamy, state president of the Sangam, said that a state-level conference of the farmers would be held at Vaiyampalayam in Coimbatore district on the birth anniversary of the late Narayanasamy Naidu, on February 6. A decision on the Sangam\u2019s support to the political parties during the forthcoming election would be taken at the conference.\n\nN. Ganesan, district secretary of the Sangam, said that the government should come to the rescue of the milk producers by directing the Aavain to sell milk powder. \u201cMilk powder had been stocked at the Aavin plants across the state. In Tiruchi alone, 2,500 tonnes of stocks were available. Supply of milk powder to the noon meal centres would help clear the dues to the milk producers,\u201d he said.",
