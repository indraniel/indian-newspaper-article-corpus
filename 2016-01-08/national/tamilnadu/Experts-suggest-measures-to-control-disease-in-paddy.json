Chandrasekaran, Joint Director of Agriculture, Tiruchi, G.Saravanan, Deputy Director (State projects), R. Pandiarajan, Personal Assistant to Collector (Agriculture), visited some of the fields in Kallikudi, Alathur, Keezhakurichi and Keezha Kalkandarkottai where incidence of rice blast and sheath blight diseases have been reported in the BPT-5204 variety. Incidence of sheath blight disease has been found in some parts of the Manikandam taluk, while the rice blast disease has been largely reported in Tiruverumbur taluk. They suggested various control measures including application of appropriate fungicides to check the spread of the diseases.\n\nThe Agriculture Department had already issued an advisory asking farmers to guard against incidence of rice blast disease. The prevailing weather condition after the monsoon rain could make the crop susceptible to the disease. Application of excessive doses of nitrogenous fertilizers, intermittent drizzles, cloudy weather, high relative, long dew periods, and low night temperature could make the crop susceptible to the disease.",
