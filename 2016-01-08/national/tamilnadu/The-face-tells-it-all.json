Ashok\n\nAll seven dancers of guru Bala Nandakumar of Layakshethra, Madurai, joined hands to worship \u2018Oothukadu\u2019 Venkatasubbaiyer\u2019s Vezha mugathu Vinayakar to bless them in their presentation of Bharathanrityam on the third day of Samajam\u2019s 64th anniversary celebrations. The dancers mimed the movement of feathers of a peacock in the background, as Lord muruga flew dramatically on its wings for Bharathi\u2019s \u2018Muruga Muruga.\u2019\n\nThey then took turns to prove their ability at producing a variety of facial expressions in traditional portrayals such as goddess Tripurasundari, mother Yashoda, naughty Krishna, as well as for the modern theme of Nandanar (ably played by Aishwarya Jagannath) who invokes the panchaboothams in his quest to have darshan of the Lord. In particular, the tableau drawn by dancers of Shiva riding a chariot pulled by horses made a good impression on the audience.\n\nUsha Nandini petted and played with Bharathiyar\u2019s little Kannamma for \u201cChinnanjiru Kiliye\u201d and \u201cAsai muham.\u201d Nivetha Mohan and Harini Nagesh matched their steps for a fast number on mother goddess. Aparna Raja excelled in producing the sringara rasa for \u201cValli kanavan.\u201d\n\nThe grace of Vishnu as Nrisimha and as Krishna, the saviour of Draupadi was next depicted on stage. Anu Priya Desigan and Priyadarshini joined the team for a \u2018kolattam\u2019 that was also well received.\n\nThe last item on the agenda was a \u2018tillana\u2019 dedicated to the saint of Kanchi, in celebration of his star Anusham.\n\nNattuvangam was in the capable hands of guru Bala Nandakumar, while Soundarya Nandakumar and P. Avantharaj lent their voices to the songs.\n\nThe orchestra comprised violin play by Chennai K.R. Suresh, mridangam by \u2018Arcot\u2019 S. Balaji and flute by \u2018Chennai\u2019 A. Mohan Raj.\n\nRAJALAKSHMI PADMANABHAN",
