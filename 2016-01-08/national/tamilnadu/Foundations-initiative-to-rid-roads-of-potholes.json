Smoothing of the road surface will also prevent back-aches for two-wheeler riders, according to the OEF. The initial stretch could be extended to Chithode, and subsequently, other important stretches, along Perundurai, Nasiyanur, Rangampalayam and Solar roads will be taken up under the initiative.",
