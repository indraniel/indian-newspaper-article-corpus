    "text": "The Madras High Court has permitted the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) to enter into power purchase agreement (PPA) as per the procedure contemplated up to an outer limit of 1,500 megawatt.\n\nModifying its earlier interim order totally prohibiting TANGEDCO from entering into any such PPA, Justice T.S. Sivagnanam passed the order on a batch of petitions moved by solar power generating companies on Wednesday.\n\nRaasi Green Earth Energy Private Limited based in Bengaluru and another such company had moved the court for a direction to the TANGEDCO to issue \u2018Noted for Record\u2019 letter pursuant to their requests to commence production and consequently execute a PPA for purchase of power from them.\n\nWhen the petitions came up for hearing, Advocate General A.L. Somayaji submitted that TANGEDCO has taken a decision to fix a ceiling of 1,500 mw as the outer limit for entering into PPA for 2015-16 and sought to modify the interim order, to which the petitioners agreed.\n\nEmbargo\n\nRecording the submissions, the judge said, \u201cThere is total embargo on TANGEDCO from entering into PPA. This, in my view, would not be in the interest of both the petitioners and TANGEDCO, and ultimately in public interest it would be appropriate to modify the earlier order.\u201d\n\nThe judge then posted the matter to January 28.",
