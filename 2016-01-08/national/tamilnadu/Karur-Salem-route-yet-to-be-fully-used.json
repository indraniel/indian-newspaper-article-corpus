There is no night trains as of now.\n\nThe Palani \u2013 Chennai Central, and Nagercoil \u2013 Bengaluru night trains are operated on the Karur \u2013 Namakkal \u2013 Salem section. The weekly Nagercoil \u2013 Kacheguda Express too runs through this sector. Passengers want the Mysore \u2013 Mayiladuthurai Express to be diverted through Namakkal. Even after commissioning of the track, the railways have not diverted the train. The diversion of this train will in no way affect the people of Erode, as they already have the Tuticorin \u2013 Mysuru express train along the route. Besides, a good number of trains are run via Erode to South Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe commuters of Salem and Namakkal want the Tirunelveli \u2013 Jammu Tawi Express too to be run through this route. Another train that could be diverted through Namakkal is the Nagercoil \u2013 Mumbai CST Express. There are several trains to Mumbai via Erode. After the laying of railway track to Karaikal, the railways introduced the Karaikal \u2013 Chennai Egmore Express via Tiruvarur \u2013 Thanjavur \u2013 Mayiladuthurai, a circuitous route, a few years ago. After the completion of the gauge conversion works along the Tiruvarur \u2013 Mayiladuthurai section, the train was diverted via Namakkal, which enabled in saving a couple of hours of travelling time. Till date Salem is not connected to Madurai via Karur and Dindigul during the day time, says Janata M.P. Velusamy, president, Mohanur Rail Commuters Welfare Association.",
