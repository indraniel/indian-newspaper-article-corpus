    "text": "While women welcome the mixies and grinders, many say the fans have been put to disuse. \u201cThe fan stopped working the day after I got it,\u201d said a beneficiary from Pumping Station street in Chindadripet.\n\n\u201cIn almost all our homes, the fans stopped working in the first few weeks,\u201d says a woman in a Otteri slum. Many beneficiaries echo the opinion. There are fewer complaints about the other two products.\n\n\u201cThe appliances are checked for quality before we distribute them. The fans could get damaged while their are being transported. We also provide contact numbers for service centres should they find any faults after using them\u201d, said a civil supplies official.",
