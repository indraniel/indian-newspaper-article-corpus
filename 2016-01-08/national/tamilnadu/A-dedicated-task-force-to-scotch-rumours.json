Based on our findings, we send out the WhatsApp messages through different groups,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nThough the city police force has a dedicated team to track social media, it started countering the hoax messages mainly during the floods.\n\n\u201cThe police control room was flooded with calls at that time. Many were to confirm if the messages they received were true. It was then we started using WhatsApp messages,\u201d said an officer.\n\nHeightening security\n\nIn certain parts of Chennai and its suburbs, policemen on patrol duty in residential areas regularly take persons roaming around in a locality in a \u2018suspicious\u2019 manner into the patrol vehicles to ascertain their identity.\n\nA senior official of the Chennai City Police said the reason some persons are taken to police stations by patrolmen is to prevent crimes and also to instill a sense of fear in miscreants.\n\nIn recent days, in a residential area in Velachery, policemen in patrol vehicles have been regularly stopping and questioning groups of people from other areas who arouse suspicion.\n\nA few who were unable to give convincing answers when questioned were taken to the police station.\n\nA police official of the Velachery Police Station said it was a routine security measure adopted to prevent crime.\n\nSuch steps have helped solve several old crime cases. Once the person is able to prove his identity, he is let free, the official added.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nVivek Narayanan and\n\nR. Srikanth)",
