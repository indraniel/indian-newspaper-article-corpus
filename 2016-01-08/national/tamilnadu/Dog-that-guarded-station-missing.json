    "text": "The missing labrador belongs a GRP inspector\n\nA Labrador, which belongs to a Government Railway Police (GRP) inspector and was guarding the railway police station at Tambaram, has gone missing.\n\nTwo-and-half-year-old Bharathi was a find of GRP Inspector S. Sekar, who gave shelter to the dog two years ago when he found it on the Perambur railway station premises.\n\nMr. Sekar said the dog, that was six months old then was ferocious when threatened by strangers.\n\n\u201cI used to take her on my rounds inside the station and she never disobeyed me. She helped us keep the station secure,\u201d Mr. Sekar said.\n\n\u201cMy enquiries with neighbouring stations proved futile and no one could trace her whereabouts,\u201d said Mr. Sekar.\n\nSomeone might have lured the dog away, he added.",
