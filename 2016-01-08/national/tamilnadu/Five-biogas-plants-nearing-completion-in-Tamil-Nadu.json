Daniel Chellappa said.\n\n\u201cAbout 90 per cent of the work is complete in Otteri, which would be inaugurated in a month; about 70 per cent work is complete in Anna Nagar. Work at the Athipattu unit would commence soon after. The work in Tuticorin is also progressing well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe biphasic \u2018Nisargruna\u2019 biomethanation technology developed by Mumbai-based BARC, can convert the biodegradable waste into manure and energy within 19 days while the conventional biogas plants would take about 40 days. About 200 such biogas units have been implemented across the country.\n\nOne such biogas plant was set up recently at Kurudampalayam near Coimbatore for District Rural Development Agency. \u201cThe unit is used as community kitchen. Food waste collected from the area is used to produce biogas,\u201d he said. Another two-tonne unit functioning at Pulianthope is energising street lights in the area and a four-tonne unit is in operation at a private company located along the OMR.\n\nThree units to come up in\n\nChennai and two\n\nin Tuticorin",
