Nagarajan, publisher of Bharathi Puthakalayam, one of the organisers.\n\nA habit formed over years\n\n\u201cThe Chennai Book Fair, which is usually held in January, has been postponed to April because of the flood. While some publishers have been affected, many of them depend on the revenue they get at the book fair \u2013 about 50 per cent of their cash sales for the year are done here. New books get published just before the book fair and a lot of debts are due to be paid around this time. Further, people are used to buying books around Pongal \u2013 it is a habit that has been formed over several years,\u201d said Mr. Nagarajan.\n\nR. S. Shanmugam, of Sri Shenbaga Pathippagam, another organiser, said: \u201cMany visitors from various countries come to Chennai around Pongal in time for the book fair. We have had many calls from customers. People like to buy books now and many publishers and booksellers cannot wait till April,\u201d he said. The proceeds from tickets sales will be donated for flood relief, he said.\n\nThe April fest\n\nThose participating in this fair will also participate in the Chennai Book Fair in April that is being organised by The Booksellers\u2019 and Publishers\u2019 Association of South India (BAPASI). \u201cWe too are members of BAPASI,\u201d said Mr. Nagarajan, adding this event will not affect Chennai Book Fair, but only help people in the trade.\n\nK.S. Pugazhenthi, general secretary of BAPASI, said the dates of Chennai Book Fair will be announced once the Assembly election schedule is notified. \u201cWork is on in full swing for Chennai Book Fair and the event promotion will start soon,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is being organised by TN Book Sales and Promotions Association. Ticket proceeds will go to flood relief",
