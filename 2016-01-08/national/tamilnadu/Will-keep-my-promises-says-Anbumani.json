If we fail to implement the promises within two years, I will step down from Chief Ministership,\u201d he told The Hindu after an interaction with representatives of various farmers\u2019 organisations here.\n\nProminent among his assurances were a separate budget for the agriculture sector, remunerative prices with 50 per cent profit to farmers for their produce, constitution of a farmers\u2019 income committee, creation of four agro-economic zones, establishment of three more agricultural universities, including one at Thanjavur, promotion of agro-technology zones for various area-specific crops across the State, construction of check dams across rivers, priority for modernisation of agriculture and organic farming and one-time waiver of crop loans of cooperative societies.",
