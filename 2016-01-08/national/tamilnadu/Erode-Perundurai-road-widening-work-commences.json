    "text": "The work on widening an 8.8 km stretch of Erode-Perundurai Road was initiated from AET School on Wednesday.\n\nThe work to be carried out by the National Highways involves widening of the road by 1.5 metres on either sides, increasing the overall width to 18 metres.\n\nThe work is scheduled for completion in one year time, official sources said.\n\nThe already four-lane stretch of 7.1 km from Perundurai town to SIPCOT complex at a cost of Rs. 22.4 crore provides easy connectivity from the city to the Salem-Cochin National Highway.\n\nThe median constructed by the State Highways during 2013-14 along the ever-busy Erode-Perundurai stretch helped in preventing occurrence of accidents, but it is still risky for vehicles to take U-turns along the road that is dotted with a number of educational institutions and business establishments on either sides.\n\nThe work is scheduled\n\nfor completion\n\nin one year\n\ntime",
