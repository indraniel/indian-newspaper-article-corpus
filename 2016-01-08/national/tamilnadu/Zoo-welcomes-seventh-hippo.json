Besides the newborn, there are three female and three male hippos at the zoo.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the newborn is a male or a female as gender identification can take up to six months with hippos,\u201d said K.S.S.V.P. Reddy, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Zoo Director. This hippo was born to four-year-old Trisha and 16-year-old Vaamburi, the oldest of the herd.\n\nThe newborn and its mother are kept in separate enclosures to enable veterinarians to provide additional care to the calf. It will be two months before it is allowed to join the herd \u2013 that too, after taking the calf\u2019s health into consideration, zoo officials said.\n\nSo far, the baby hippo, which is yet to receive a name, has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass.\n\nFemale hippopotamuses generally keep their offspring in their custody for at least a year, a forester said. \u201cHippos normally do not breed in captivity and they need pure water courses. Provision of a congenial atmosphere for breeding and constant monitoring of the pair\u2019s living space and health have helped them breed successfully here at the zoo,\u201d said Mr. Reddy.\n\nWhile a female hippo is ready for mating after three or four years, a male hippo must be seven or eight to be successful. Hippos deliver their calves under water.\n\nThe baby hippo has been enjoying bits of everything, from bread and bananas to potatoes and elephant grass",
