Periasamy\n\nThe size of a traffic island close to the City Police Commissioner\u2019s bungalow at Red Fields was reduced as it was causing inconvenience to vehicle users. The junction connects Sungam on Trichy Road with Avinashi Road and Puliyakulam with Race Course.\n\nA couple of years ago, the small junction had a traffic umbrella that was damaged after it was hit by a heavy vehicle and was removed. Last year, the city police constructed a traffic island with a diameter of about 15 feet.\n\nIt was to encourage vehicles taking the right turn to go around the island.\n\nBut, the island turned out to be more of a hindrance than help especially for town buses.\n\nFollowing representations made by road users, the police on Monday decided to reduce the width of the island by almost half.",
