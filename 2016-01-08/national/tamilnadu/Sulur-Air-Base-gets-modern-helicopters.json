Seen is Air Commodore S. Kumar, Air Office Commanding of Air Force Station Sulur (right).\n\nTwo helicopters in a warrior formation rat-a-tatted into sight, swung around, and hovered rock steady as a rope snaked out. Garud Commandos slithered down and ran to take their places a few meters away.\n\nThe rope was hauled in and the helicopters took off again.\n\nThey came in for a formation landing, one behind the other, and as they taxied to a stop, crash tenders parked on either side directed a shower of water on them \u2013 a ritual to welcome new entrants to the fleet.\n\n\u201cThe helicopters that are being formally inducted today have already had their baptism, through water,\u201d said Air Marshal Jasbir Walia, VM VSM, the Air Officer Commander-in-Chief of Southern Air Command, who was present on the occasion.\n\nHe was at the Sulur Air Base on Thursday to formally hand over the helicopters to the Commanding Officer of 109 Helicopter Unit, Wg Cdr Ashok Kumar, VM.\n\nThe Air Marshal was referring to the fact that four of these helicopters took part in the recent relief and rescue operations during the Chennai floods.
