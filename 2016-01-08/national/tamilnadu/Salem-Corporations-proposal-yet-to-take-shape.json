LAKSHMI NARAYANAN\n\nIt is almost two years now that the corporation\u2019s proposal to scientifically process the entire three lakh tonne garbage accumulated in Erumapalayam compost yard did not take off leaving the residents to bear the stench emanating out of it.\n\nThe yard has been used by the civic body for dumping the municipal solid waste for the last 50 years.\n\nSpread across 14 acres in Erumapalayam, the yard is located amid residential areas as they have long been complaining of smoke and stink from the yard.\n\nAfter the private garbage processing plant was established at Chettichavadi, dumping of garbage was stopped in Erumapalayam. When the private processing plant did not function properly, the civic body started to dump garbage that was strongly opposed by the residents in 2014. The mounting garbage is about 18 ft high as the civic body had in July 2013 announced that the garbage would be processed through bio-mining technology. Also, it had announced setting up of pre-processing units at over Rs. 4 crore and setting up of a park in the yard.\n\nHowever, the project is yet to take off and currently bushes and trees have come up in large numbers in the yard. Residents have been long demanding of clearing the garbage so that they will be able to inhale fresh air. They said that stink continue to emanate from the garbage and children and elderly people face health issues. Residents wanted concrete action to be taken to process the garbage scientifically so that they are not affected.",
