Pazhuvur-Ariyalur segment, particularly those at Pudupalayam village panchayat and those in Sendurai belt say that the yield had been reduced drastically. Sekar, a farmer of Nerunjikorai near Pudupalayam says that he had raised the crop during November on 20 cents. Although he expected 100 kg, he could harvest just 10 to 15 kg. He attributed the fall in yield to incessant rain in early December. This year, in the absence of surplus production, the harvested produce was sufficient for domestic consumption and he would not be able to sell it to wholesale dealers. Many farmers were seen thrashing their produce by spreading it on the Tiruchi \u2013 Ariyalur highway.\n\nAgriculture Department officials say that black gram was being raised in two different seasons in the district \u2013 during the Kharif and Rabi seasons. This year\u2019s showers during the monsoon was quite an unexpected one and, black gram cultivators who had raised the crop during November were the worst-hit, he said indicating that farmers who had raised the crop a little earlier would register higher yield.\n\nThe district accounted for 2,500 hectares under pulses including black gram and the Agriculture Department encouraged black gram cultivation by special incentives of Rs.30 a kg for increasing the area and also for augmenting yield under black gram cultivation.\n\nThe official said that most farmers resorted to raising black gram cultivation as an intercrop along with cashew and other horticultural varieties.\n\n\u201cThe crop is raised on smaller landholdings, as most farmers were inclined towards just domestic consumption,\u201d the official said adding that the department has been motivating farmers to go in for pulses. \u201cThe sudden rise in the prices of thoor dhal has created some awareness among the farmers about the profitability of pulses and we have been cashing in on this trend to motivate the farmers to switch over to pulses as a main crop,\u201d he said. Most farmers raised \u2018Vamban 2\u2019 or \u2018Vamban 5\u2019 variety in this district, the source told The Hindu on Wednesday.",
