    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday wondered why the State Government was hesitant to argue a writ appeal filed by it against the imposition of a dress code for entry into temples administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department. Justice S. Vaidyanathan had prescribed the dress code in an order issued late last year.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran directed its Registry to list the State appeal for hearing on Monday along with two other petitions \u2014 one filed by P. Suganthi, State general secretary of the All India Democratic Women\u2019s Association (AIDWA) and another by G. Sarika of Southern Districts Women\u2019s Federation \u2014 seeking leave of the court to file appeals. Earlier, Special Government Pleader VR. Shanmuganathan told the court that the Registry has been requested to list the appeal for admission on Tuesday to facilitate the appearance of Advocate General. However, the judges asked him to make his submissions on Monday and directed U. Nirmala Rani and A. Rajini, counsel for private appellants, to serve their papers on him in the meantime.\n\nDisposing of a writ petition, seeking permission for cultural programmes in view of a temple festival in Tiruchi district, on November 26, Justice S. Vaidyanathan had ordered that from January 1, men should wear \u201cdhoti or pyjama with upper cloth or formal pants and shirts\u201d and women \u201csari or half sari with blouse or churidhar with upper cloth\u201d to temples. He also ordered that children could go in \u201cany fully-covered dress.\u201d",
