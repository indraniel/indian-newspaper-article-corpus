    "text": "Tense moments prevailed in the Poonamallee Court when an undertrial threw his footwear at a magistrate on Thursday afternoon. Ezhumalai (38) was arrested by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) a year ago for stealing railway property in Avadi. He was put in Puzhal jail. \u201cFifteen days ago, he was brought for a hearing. He wanted the case to be over soon. He either wanted to be convicted or released,\u201d said E.T. Nandakumaran, president, Poonamalee Bar Association.\n\nOn Thursday, Ezhumalai was brought to the Poonamalee court again. \u201cWhen the hearing was about to be completed, he threw the footwear at judge D. Nisha. But it fell on the table,\u201d he said.\n\nEzhumalai was immediately removed from the court premises and taken to Puzhal again. \u201cWe have registered a case under section 355 (Assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation) and section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty). We will be investigating why he threw the footwear at the Judge,\u201d said a police officer.",
