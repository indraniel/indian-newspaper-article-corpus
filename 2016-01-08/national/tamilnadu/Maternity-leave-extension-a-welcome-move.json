    "text": "Doctors and women working for private sectors call it positive legislation\n\noctors in the city have welcomed reports on the move to increase maternity leave for women employed in the private sector.\n\n\u201cMost organisations, including hospitals, only offer three months\u2019 maternity leave. The recommended period for exclusive breastfeeding is six months and so, many women employees find it difficult to cope. Some of them are forced to introduce solids to their infants early or take extended unpaid leave. In many cases, women simply have to quit their jobs,\u201d says S. Subramanian, neonatologist and one of the founders of the Mothers\u2019 and Infants\u2019 Lactation/Breastfeeding Care Centre in Mylapore.\n\nDr. Subramanian, who sees at least 30 working mothers every month, adds that workplaces should also look at creating facilities for breastfeeding mothers and allow them time in between work to feed.\n\n\u201cThe extension of leave is a positive step,\u201d he said.\n\nWith anaemia still affecting a large number of Indian women and with lifestyles changing and increasingly stressful jobs, six months is now needed to ensure better recovery for the mother and nutritional health of the child, says Priya Selvaraj, assistant director, GG Hospital. \u201cOther countries have this, so why not India,\u201d she said.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nFor a large number of poor women, bottle feeding is expensive, says Sumana Manohar, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Apollo Hospitals. \u201cBreastfeeding is cheaper and a lot of working women suffer when they have to go back to work. Breastfeeding is also important for the bonding of the mother and the child,\u201d she said.\n\nSays Sangeetha Anpazhagan, working a private e-learning company: \u201cI went back to work immediately after my three months\u2019 leave. It was very difficult but I had the support of my family. For those without support, it will be nearly impossible to go back in just three months.\u201d",
