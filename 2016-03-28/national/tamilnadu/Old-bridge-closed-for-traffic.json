    "text": "The 16 Gate Ellis Surplus sluices bridge in Mettur was closed for traffic, following the construction and inauguration of a new bridge nearby.\n\nThe bridge near the sluices was constructed in 1934 and vehicles from Thangama Puri Pattinam, located on the left side of the Mettur Dam, used it to move to Salem camp area.\n\nEarlier, heavy vehicles were allowed on this bridge. Since it is more than 80 years old, only school vans and two-wheelers are allowed during the morning and evening hours for the last five years.\n\nAnd, when the water level crosses 120-feet mark, traffic on the bridge will be closed and road users have to use the Thermal Bridge and travel to reach destinations on either side.\n\nFollowing persistent demand, the government sanctioned funds for the construction of a new high-level bridge across 16 Gate Ellis surplus sluices in Mettur.\n\nThe work was undertaken by the State Highways Department at an outlay of Rs. 23.21 crore with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nThe Chief Minister inaugurated the bridge through video conferencing recently.",
