Viswanathan on Thursday dismissed reports of PWF having alliance with the ruling All India NR Congress.\n\nFollowing the DMDK led by Vijayakant on Wednesday entering into an alliance with the four-party People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan reportedly told a television channel that DMDK- PWF is likely to have alliance with AINRC in the Union Territory of Puducherry.\n\nAddressing media persons here, Mr. Viswanathan said, as far as PWF in Puducherry is concerned, we have declared already that there would be no alliance with Congress, BJP and Dravidian parties. The AINRC in alliance with the BJP contested last parliamentary elections. So far the AINRC has not come out from the BJP-led alliance.\n\n\u201cMoreover the political stand of the AINRC is not acceptable to us. Hence we have not conducted alliance talks with the party,\u201d said Mr. Viswanathan.",
