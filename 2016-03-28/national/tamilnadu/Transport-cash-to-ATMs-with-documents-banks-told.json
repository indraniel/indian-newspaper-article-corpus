Prabakar instructed the officials to unfailingly provide the necessary documents while transporting cash to ATMs.\n\nThe flying squads that act on the basis of the complaints routed to them through the control room at the collectorate will necessarily seize the cash if there is no documentary proof.\n\nBanks have to maintain separate entries of transactions by customers in excess of Rs. one lakh and Rs. 10 lakh.\n\nInformation about customers who redeem jewellery for excessive amounts must also be passed on to the control room, the Collector said.\n\nCampaign expenses\n\nFlying squads have been vested by the Election Commission with the responsibility of keeping vigil over excessive campaign expenses, distribution of items as bribe in cash or in kind, movement of illegal arms, ammunition, liquor or anti-social elements in the constituencies assigned to them. The vehicles used by flying squads and static surveillance teams have been fitted with GPRS enabled tracking unit to monitor their timely action, the bank officials were told.",
