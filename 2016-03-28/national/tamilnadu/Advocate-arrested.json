Petchimuthu (28) of Rahmath Nagar in Palayamkottai was returning home from Madurai in a car along with his friends on March 10.\n\nWhen they were crossing Tirumangalam, a cement-laden lorry, proceeding from Karur to Sattankulam, hit the car. Petchimuthu and his friends demanded Rs. 3 lakh as compensation from lorry driver Andiappan (54) of Kovilpatti. As he could not pay the amount, Petchimuthu and his friends brought Andiappan to Rahmath Nagar, detained him illegally in a house and beat him, the police said.\n\nWhen Andiappan managed to escape from the illegal detention, he was rescued by Palayamkottai police who admitted him to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for treatment.",
