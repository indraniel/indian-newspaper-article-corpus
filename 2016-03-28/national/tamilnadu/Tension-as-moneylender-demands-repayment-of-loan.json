    "text": "Tension prevailed at Surandai in the district on Saturday evening after a moneylender and his supporters unleashed terror in the guise of collecting loan.\n\nPolice said that S. Manikandan (36), who runs a garment showroom, had borrowed Rs. 6.50 lakh from S. Murugan of Gurusamypatti. Since this amount was not sufficient to run the business, he had taken loans from a few others as well. When he could not repay the loans, the pressure exerted by the moneylenders forced him to go underground.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the garment showroom building owner, C. Arunagiri Murugan (32) started running the business even as Manikandan continued to remain underground. When Arunagiri Murugan and the staff of the garment showroom were in the shop on Saturday evening, moneylender Murugan and his supporters stormed the showroom and threatened him to repay the loan Manikandan had taken.\n\nWhen Arunagiri refused, Murugan and his associates flushed out the customers and the staff of the showroom, forced Arunagiri to remain inside and locked the showroom. The gang also started threatening passers-by and owners of nearby shops.\n\nWhen the public and the affected traders were getting ready to launch an attack on the moneylender\u2019s associates after rescuing Arunagiri, the police reached the spot. However, Murugan and his associates escaped.\n\nSurandai police have registered a case against Murugan and his supporters.",
