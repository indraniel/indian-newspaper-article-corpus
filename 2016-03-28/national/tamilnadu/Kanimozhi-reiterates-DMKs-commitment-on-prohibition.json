She was addressing a joint consultative meeting of DMK district women\u2019s wing here on Sunday.\n\nMs. Kanimozhi said, \u201cTamil Nadu has become a State with most number of young widows in India because of alcoholism. It not only killed many youths but it also killed skills of several youngsters and rendered them unsuitable for any job. Seventy-five per cent of revenue of the families of alcoholic men goes to liquor shop. That\u2019s why people like Sasi Perumal and women\u2019s organisations struggled for closure of liquor shops and imposition of prohibition.\u201d She alleged that the AIADMK government was unwilling to close Tasmac shops because \u201cthe liquor manufacturing company run by Jayalalithaa\u2019s proxies would lose revenue.\u201d Once DMK comes back to power, party chief Karunanidhi would put down his first signature to reintroduce prohibition in the State, she said.\n\nShe said that Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) introduced by DMK government helped women gain economical empowerment. It was only the DMK that gave equal rights for women in ancestral properties for the first time in the nation. Apart from providing marriage assistance to women who had completed eighth standard, the party encouraged the girls\u2019 education. Later the assistance was increased for those who had completed Plus Two and degree. Instead of speaking these facts in stages, the women\u2019s wing members should go and speak with women at their places, she insisted.\n\nFormer Minister and Tiruvannamalai south district secretary E.V. Velu, north district secretary R. Sivanandham, former Minister K. Pichandi, district presidium chairman D. Venugopal, State Secretariat member R. Sridharan, town secretary Karthi Velmaran participated. South District Women\u2019s wing secretary Vijayalakshmi Ramesh presided.",
