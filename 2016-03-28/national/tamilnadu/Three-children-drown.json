    "text": "Three schoolchildren drowned in an abandoned farm well near Tiruttani in Tiruvallur district on Sunday.\n\nTiruvallur district police sources said the girls \u2014 R. Srimathi (10), S. Roja (11) and N. Amsavalli (9) \u2014 belonging to S. Kandigai Colony in R.K. Pet Taluk, had gone to the open well located outside the village around noon without informing their parents.\n\nPolice said initial investigations revealed that the girls had slipped and fallen into the well. The well was old and dilapidated and had remained unused for several years, police said. The girls had left in the morning and when they did not return home, their relatives and neighbours began a search for them, which led them to the well.\n\nThe shocked residents found the girls floating on the surface.\n\nSome of them jumped into the well and pulled the three out. They were then rushed to a private hospital nearby. But the doctors declared them dead on arrival.\n\nA case under Section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure has been registered at R.K. Pet police station, sources said. The bodies were sent to Tiruttani Government Hospital for post-mortem.\n\nSources said all the girls were students of Class V.\n\nWith summer reaching its peak, youngsters often tend to visit wells, lakes and tanks to cool off.\n\nPolice appealed to parents to keep a close watch on their children and ensure that they did not venture anywhere near wells or waterbodies.\n\nHowever, if they insisted on going to such places, parents need to ensure that they are accompanied by an elder member of the family, police added.",
