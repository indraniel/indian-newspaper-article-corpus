    "text": "Tamil Nadu Thowheedh Jamaath on Sunday sought doubling of reservation for Muslims to seven per cent.\n\nThe AIADMK, DMK and all other major parties have, in the past, acknowledged the need to increase reservation for Muslims in employment and education to create equal opportunities for addressing backwardness of Muslims, and hence, the party that assumes power later this year must make it a priority, State president of TNTJ Fakeer Mohamed Altaphi emphasised.\n\nLikewise, the Puducherry government must also honour the resolution it adopted for providing 6.1 per cent reservation for Muslims.\n\nEven the existing reservation for Muslims will hold meaning only if its candidates seeking jobs are listed within first five applicants under the roster system, from 15th at present. Those converting to Islam must be extended the benefits of reservation, he told mediapersons on the sidelines of TNTJ\u2019s 17th State General Body meeting.\n\nThe TNTJ will, however, desist from expressing its support for any political party this time. It was because the organisation\u2019s credibility had to be safeguarded since the parties that had received pronounced support in the past had gone back on the promises they had made for uplift of Muslims, Mr. Altaphi said.\n\nThe meeting adopted resolutions thanking those who worked for the success of Shirk Abolition conference in Tiruchi earlier this year. Another resolution called for complete abolition of liquor to pave way for economic development, and preventing law and order problems.\n\nOther resolutions adopted at the meeting included a demand to Prime Minister Modi to rein in anti-Muslim activities in the country.",
