It will address all water-related queries, help a person understand rainwater harvesting and other methods of conserving water.\n\n\u201cWe have registered this as an NGO arm of our start-up Rainstock. Before starting this centre, we visited a similar centre in Chennai. We also met experts in this field from Bengaluru and parts of northern India,\u201d said K. Sakthivel, founder and CEO of Rainstock. During this process, Mr. Sakthivel and his college professor V.S. Arvind (also a co-founder) realised that there were very few experts who could teach people about harvesting water.\n\n\u201cThat is how the idea of setting up this centre came about,\u201d said Mr. Sakthivel .\n\nRainstock deals with installing\n\ncost-effective rainwater harvesting systems",
