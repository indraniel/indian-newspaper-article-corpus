The hatchlings will then be released into the sea.\n\n\u201cDuring the awareness meetings being organised in the coastal villages, the forest personnel will explain in detail to the coastal population the pivotal role being played by the turtles in maintaining a balanced marine ecosystem, which is essential for fish breeding. Since the fishermen have understood the need for conserving turtles, poaching has been stopped to the maximum possible extent,\u201d says N.K. Stanley Jones, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Coastal Security Group.\n\nAs a set of eggs kept in the hatchery at Panjal hatched recently, the hatchlings were released into the sea on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve so far released more than 1,000 young ones after Panjal hatchery started functioning,\u201d said an employee.",
