    "text": "DMDK leader Premalatha on Sunday found fault with Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for not visiting Thoothukudi city which was also inundated during the December floods.\n\nAddressing a public meeting here, she said thousands lost their houses and belongings in the floods that ravaged Thoothukudi, but Ms. Jayalalithaa ignored them and their sufferings. She merely visited the flood-hit R.K. Nagar, her constituency in Chennai, and spoke as if she was on a poll campaign.\n\nHitting out at the AIADMK regime, Ms. Premalatha said it was the Central government, which provided Rs.2,000 crore towards flood relief and rehabilitation for the victims and not the State government. Once the Model Code of Conduct, the flood relief distribution was stopped to thousands, she charged.\n\nGujarat had implemented prohibition and Bihar has promised to implement it, but the Tamil Nadu government was reluctant to close down the State-run TASMAC liquor shops despite public outcry, she said.\n\nLambasting both AIADMK and DMK, she said the parties relied purely on cash for votes and freebies to win elections. The Chief Minister had failed to implement major schemes like Udangudi thermal power plant project which was yet to take off. They were all empty promises, Ms. Premalatha said, asking the electorate to dethrone the AIADMK government.",
