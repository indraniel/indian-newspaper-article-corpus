Periasamy\n\nOn Sunday morning, Prafulla Thakkar with her sneakers on was shaking her legs to a Hindi number at the Car-free Sundays that The Hindu has been organising with the Coimbatore Corporation and the Coimbatore City Traffic Police on NSR Road, Saibaba Colony.\n\nThe 57-year-old said she had always wanted to dance, but felt shy. At places where she had danced \u2013 relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 weddings and Navarathri \u2013 it had always been under compulsion. \u201cBut today, I\u2019m myself. After the initial hesitation, I told myself to get out of the fear and dance. I did it and now am feeling happy and energetic.\u201d She was dancing to numbers rendered by a group of youngsters.\n\nAt the other end of the Car-free Sunday stretch was G. Nelish Darshan of KG Layout. The third standard student with a chalk in hand drew shark and dolphin on the road that was all his. \u201cI\u2019m drawing because I know drawing and enjoy it,\u201d pat came the reply.\n\nA little away from him were brothers, Suraj S. and Sanjay S., walking with rolled papers on their hands. They were just returning from a sitting with artist V. Chandrasekar, who had caricatured them. \u201cLast Sunday, I was here to see what\u2019s going on. This week, I got caricatured,\u201d Suraj said.\n\nIn another part of the road was P. Jagannatha Reddiar of Bhadrasamy Street. With his head and neck to the ground, he had raised his torso for an asana. \u201cI\u2019m 81 years old and enjoy what I do,\u201d he said and wanted people to practice yoga.\n\nThere were hundreds like the aforementioned who had thronged NSR Road to enjoy aerobic sessions by Bethovan, watch street play by students of CMS College, solo dance performances, listen to karaoke sessions with Radio City and watch zumba, Bharatnatyam and skit by AJK College students.\n\nRadio City (91.1) was the Radio partner and Mark 1 Events was the events manager. The three-hour-long event recorded by Radio City will be aired on Friday as a prelude for the next Sunday.
