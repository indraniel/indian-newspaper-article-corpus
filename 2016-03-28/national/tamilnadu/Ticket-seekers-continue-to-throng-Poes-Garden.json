    "text": "Candidates from Pudukottai, Dindigul and Theni were interviewed\n\nThe small idol of Lord Ganesha at a three-way junction inside Poes Garden has been getting a lot of attention these days. AIADMK cadres who come to attend interviews at the official residence of the party general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and their supporters leave behind cash offerings and even bouquets in prayers.\n\nThe posh residential locality has become very busy with ticket aspirants from all over the State awaiting their turn. Ms. Jayalalithaa had completed the first round of interviews in the first week of March. The Ganesha temple, near which vehicles are stopped, is also a point where a large number of mediapersons and police personnel wait. Men are seen talking among themselves, but fall silent when someone enters or leaves the road leading to Ms. Jayalalithaa\u2019s house. A crowd surges forward, but the police keep pushing it back to the footpath. While aspirants discuss politics and who is in and who is out, small vendors in the area seem to have made a quick buck. With the mercury soaring, for those standing on the road-side, apart from the bubbletop water dispenser at the junction, the tiny store on Binny Road is the only place that stocks water. It is evident that sale of water, soft drinks and short eats have been brisk this past week.\n\nOn Sunday, candidates from Pudukottai, Dindigul and Theni were interviewed. Already, aspirants from Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Vellore, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Ramanthapuram and Madurai were interviewed.\n\nWith steady stream of crowd, small eateries and roadside vendors doing brisk business",
