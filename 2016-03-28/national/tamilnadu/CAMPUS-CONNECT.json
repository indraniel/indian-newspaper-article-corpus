John Joseph Sundaram said.\n\nStating that taking calculated risk was part of any entrepreneurial venture, Principal P. Devanesan noted that once a person gets adequately qualified to undertake jobs in a particular sector, it was better for him to venture into a business of his or hers own for a bright career. Entrepreneurs would form the bedrock of the nation's economic development and progress, he opined.\n\nChief guests M. Rajamaheswari Kamaraj and A. Arcokiasamy emphasised the importance of entrepreneurship in business for the economic development of India. They called upon the enterprising youth to venture into viable business options rather than awaiting suitable jobs even after getting some hands on training and gathering adequate experience. That would solve the unemployment problem, they noted.\n\nPep talk for\n\nfresh graduates\n\nGrowing by learning, persevering to chase dreams through hard work and being a good human being with a great attitude are important characteristics that youth should imbibe to thrive in the extremely competitive environment, said P.B.
