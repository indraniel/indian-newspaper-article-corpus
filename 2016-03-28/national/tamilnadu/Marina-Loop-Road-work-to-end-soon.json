Pichumani\n\nGreater Chennai Corporation has resumed work along Marina Loop Road, as a result of which the seaward side of the stretch has been closed for traffic. The stretch is expected to be opened for traffic by April. The project was delayed by a few years after environmental activists and fishermen opposed it, alleging violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) rules.\n\nThe original proposal included the development of walkways, benches, a gallery, bicycle tracks, concrete roads, service trenches, rainwater trenches and streetlight fittings at an estimated cost of Rs. 40 crore for the 2.8-km stretch from Lighthouse to Foreshore Estate.\n\nFollowing opposition, the civic body decided to construct the road and stormwater drain, dropping other key aspects of the project.\n\nAfter staying the project, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) gave the nod to the implementation of the project with certain conditions. Environmental activists alleged that the area where the road was being laid was within 35 metres of the sea and closer to the High Tide Line. They also said the project would affect turtle nesting.\n\nThe Greater Chennai Corporation is not likely to evict any resident who received eviction notices earlier. Many fishermen were asked to vacate the houses by March 27 last year.\n\nCorporation officials said the project would improve water flow to the 300-acre Adyar Creek that was being restored. Work on new drains to carry stormwater to the creek would be completed before monsoon this year.",
