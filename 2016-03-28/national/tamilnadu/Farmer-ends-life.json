    "text": "A distraught farmer, reportedly hemmed in from all sides by loans he had taken for agricultural purposes, ended his life by consuming pesticide near here on Saturday night.\n\nRelatives of Dhanasekar (47) of Kothangudi village said that he had borrowed Rs. one lakh from the Thirupurambiyam Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society in 2014 and repaid only Rs. 10,000. Society officials had been pestering Dhanasekaran over phone to repay the balance for some time.\n\nAlso, Dhanasekar had borrowed about Rs. five lakh at exorbitant interest rates from private money lenders and they too had been pressuring him to pay the interest on time. Due to financial woes, domestic trouble erupted.\n\nUnable to withstand the mounting pressure, Dhanasekar consumed pesticide and was found unconscious near his field on Saturday by his relatives. They rushed him to the Government Hospital, Kumbakonam, but he died on the way. Police sent the body to the GH for post-mortem.\n\nMeanwhile, sources said that the AIADMK local leaders reached out to the family of Dhanasekar, who was also an active AIADMK member, and reportedly promised to take care of his loans even as sections of the Opposition were trying to make an issue out of the death.",
