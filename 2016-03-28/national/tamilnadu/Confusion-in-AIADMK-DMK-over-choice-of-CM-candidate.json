Karunanidhi and party treasurer M.K. Stalin) as to who should be the Chief Ministerial candidate in their party.\n\n\u201cIt is only the DMDK-People\u2019s Welfare Front alliance that has announced its Chief Ministerial candidate and the DMDK released its election manifesto.\n\n\u201cWhy is Ms. Jayalalithaa, known for hurriedly releasing names of the candidates, not doing it now? It is because, Captain (Vijayakant) is not in her alliance. She is maintaining a stoic silence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe myth called Jayalalithaa will be exposed in 2016 Assembly election. But, the DMK will end up daydreaming that Ms. Jayalalithaa\u2019s failure will benefit it. The people will no more decide to prefer the deep sea to the devil,\u201d she said. When milk, cooking gas cylinders and newspapers could be delivered at home, why could not the PDS goods be issued at people\u2019s doorsteps, she asked.\n\nExplaining the party manifesto, she said that freebies would be promoted only in education and health sectors.\n\nA specialised team to fight corruption would be formed under the DMDK-led government. People could mail their problems, which would be looked into immediately. None of the leaders in the five parties in the DMDK-PWF alliance faced any corruption charge or any criminal case, unlike the leaders of the rival Dravidian parties, she noted. \u201cOnly ours can be the alternative to both the corrupt parties,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal leaders of the alliance parties took part.",
