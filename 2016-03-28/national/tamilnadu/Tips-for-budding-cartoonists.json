    "text": "In an attempt to create awareness and encourage youth, cartoonists from across the city came together and organised a day-long workshop to teach them to improve their skills and excel in their field.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I loved drawing. My family would often mock me, but my father saw my interest and motivated me to draw more. He is the reason I am happy today,\u201d said Jayaraj, a renowned cartoonist while addressing the audience at Rajan Eye Care Hospital auditorium on Sunday. \u201cLook around you, whatever you see, put them in paper, give the characters life. There is nothing that feels better than that,\u201d he said.\n\nFilmmaker J.S. Nandhini, who has also created her first digital graphic novel Sivappu Kal Mookuthi (\u2018Girl with a Red Nose Ring\u2019) presided over the event and spoke about her experience as a story teller. \u201cCartoons and comics provide a wonderful opportunity to people to showcase ideas and skills. It was my cartoon character and books that made me visualise my characters in my first movie Thiru Thiru Thuru Thuru ,\u201d she said.\n\nBankers, retired government officials and school and college students attended the workshop. \u201cSketching makes me calm. After a long day at work, I come home and put my pen to work,\u201d said S. Devanathan, a retired bank official who also contributes cartoons and caricature to magazines. \u201cThis is indeed helpful. I\u2019ll now go home and draw better,\u201d said S. Ashwin, a class 9 student.",
