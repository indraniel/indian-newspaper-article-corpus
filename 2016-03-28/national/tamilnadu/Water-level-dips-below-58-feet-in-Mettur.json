Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nWater level in the Stanley reservoir in Mettur has dipped below 58 feet mark due to poor inflow for the past few weeks.\n\nThe water level in the Mettur Dam, the lifeline of the Cauvery delta districts, plunged to 57.94 feet on Sunday evening against its full capacity of 120 feet.\n\nThe reservoir was receiving a meagre 111 cusecs of water and the storage level stood at 23.175 tmc.\n\nPublic Works Department source said that following the poor water level, the release of water from the dam for drinking water purpose in the delta region was brought down from 2,000 cusecs to 1.500 cusecs on Saturday evening.\n\nThe water holding area near the 16 Gate Ellis Surplus sluices has already become dry and is posing a rocky look. Water stagnation on the right side of the dam is giving a look of a lake.\n\nThe PWD and the State Fisheries Department have already shifted their mechanised boats used for inspection purposes.",
