    "text": "Karunanidhi says there could not be a more suitable example on the Centre-State relationship than the remarks of Piyush Goyal.\n\nThe Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M. Karunanidhi, on Sunday, sought the response of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s recent accusation that Tamil Nadu was functioning like a \u201cState within a State\u201d with limited access to her.\n\nThe Minister had at a function in Delhi on Friday last remarked that he was not able to contact the Chief Minister for official discussions.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said there could not be a better example on the Centre-State relationship than the remarks of the Minister.\n\n\u201cWhen a Union Power Minister himself says in a public function that he had not got opportunities to meet and discuss with the Chief Minister or with a Minister, I expect Ms. Jayalalithaa to give the State\u2019s explanation to this,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Goyal had claimed that he was not able to reach out to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister or her Cabinet members to discuss power reforms.\n\n\u201cI made several attempts to contact leaders in the Jayalalithaa government. I have access to 28 States in this country, but for the 29th State when I want to talk to someone, I can\u2019t. I call up and talk to the Power Minister of the State, and he says he will get back to me after he speaks with Amma (Jayalalithaa),\u201d he said.\n\nThe one time in 22 months that he managed to speak to Ms. Jayalalithaa, Mr. Goyal said the Chief Minister promised to send a team. \u201cThe team met me\u2026But to date they haven\u2019t signed up [for the reforms],\u201d he claimed.\n\nMr. Goyal also hit out at AIADMK Parliamentarians, stating that they only read statements \u201csanitised\u201d in Chennai.\n\nWill be a poll issue\n\nSources in the Tamil Nadu BJP said Mr. Goyal\u2019s comments would be used in the Assembly election campaign. \u201cWe are planning to use it in our social media campaigns. A translated version of the speech would soon be circulated so that it reaches the masses,\u201d BJP media committee chairman S.R. Sekar said.\n\nAIADMK leaders, whom The Hindu contacted, claimed that a video clip of Mr Goyal\u2019s remarks was being circulated keeping the election in mind. \u201cThe Centre has not given what we asked for. Our list of demands has not been met. The Chief Minister had also commented that this year\u2019s Union Budget did not have anything in it for the State. They have no locus standi to talk,\u201d said a leader requesting anonymity.\n\nAnother leader said nothing is communicated orally between the Centre and the State. If there is some written correspondence it is immediately sent to the department concerned.\n\n\u201cHow can a Union Minister of State communicate with a Chief Minister over phone on an administrative matter? Perhaps because of the election they are saying such things. When it comes to power sector reforms, it involves thousands of employees and thousands of crores of money. The Government of India is not giving adequate money to the State,\u201d he said.",
