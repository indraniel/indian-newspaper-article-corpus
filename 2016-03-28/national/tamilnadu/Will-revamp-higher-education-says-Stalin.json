Stalin on Saturday stressed the need for creating employment opportunities in Tamil Nadu as 28.7 per cent of the State\u2019s population was under the age of 18.\n\nAddressing a meeting organised by the party students\u2019 wing, he said Tamil Nadu was losing industrial investment and industries were shifting their base to other states because of the indifferent attitude of the AIADMK government.\n\nMr. Stalin said if elected to power, the DMK would totally revamp the higher education to make it relevant to the needs of the 21{+s}{+t}century.\n\nCalling upon the students and youths to join politics, he said their participation alone would usher in a change in Tamil Nadu.\n\nLater, he visited the house of Hepziba who won the gold medal in 100 metres and a silver medal in 400 metres and bronze in hurdles at Street Child Games in Rio.\n\n\u201cIt is condemnable that no representative of the State government received her at the airport,\u201d he said.",
