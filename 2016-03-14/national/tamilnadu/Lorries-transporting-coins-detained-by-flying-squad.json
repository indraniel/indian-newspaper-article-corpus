Kannan, RDO, verified the available documents and made enquiries with the drivers.\n\nLater, he contacted the RBI office at Hyderabad to clarify certain facts.\n\nFollowing this, the RBI top officials forwarded all the needed details and documents to substantiate the same by e-mail.\n\nAfter the receipt of the e-mail, the container lorries were allowed to continue their journey.\n\nOfficial sources told The Hindu that the lorries were taken to the RDO office as a security measure, as transporting the coins of such a huge volume during the night hours without escort was a risky job.\n\n\u201cThe container lorries were released as soon as the e-mail message was received within a few hours\u201d, the sources added.",
