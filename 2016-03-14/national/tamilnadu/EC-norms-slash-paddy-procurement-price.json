    "text": "Despite bumper harvest, stringent Election Commission of India rules for carrying cash when model code of conduct is in force have slashed paddy procurement price to rock bottom in Cumbum Valley, wiping out farmers\u2019 minimum profit in the second cropping season.\n\nThe EC norms prevent outstation traders, mostly from Delta areas and Kerala, from procuring paddy directly from farmers as they cannot carry huge money with them. At present, harvesting is in full swing in the Valley, especially in Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam and Palanichettipatti.\n\n\u201cWith no cash flow, procurement price of fine quality paddy has dwindled to Rs. 820 a bag (63 kg), which was Rs. 1,050 a bag during the first cropping season,\u201d said S. Azhagumalai of Chinnamanur. \u201cFarmers had got 40 bags an acre last year. Now they harvest 50 to 55 bags per acre,\u201d he added. In the absence of outstation traders, local traders, mostly middlemen, offer very low procurement price by forming a syndicate.\n\n\u201cIt was a level playground last season as outstation traders competed with local buyers and procured paddy directly from farmers offering better price. Now, arrival of outstation traders has come down sharply as they could not carry large amounts in hand,\u201d said S. Pandia Raj of Chinnamanur. Moreover, the farmers expect cash immediately after sale \u2013 in the field itself. They neither believe outstation traders nor accept cheque or other mode of payment.\n\n\u201cWe need hefty sum in hand to procure paddy every day. Earlier, I used to lease a rice mill in Theni to convert procured paddy into rice to transport directly to rice market. That too requires huge cash. Carrying huge amount is not advisable now. With no option, we depend on local traders for procurement\u201d, said N. Sivaraman, a trader from Thanjavur.\n\nA sizable amount seized during the previous election had not been fully refunded. \u201cWe cannot take risk again\u201d, said another outstation trader.\n\nCapitalising on the situation, local traders exploit farmers. Ironically, EC norms help middlemen make better profit, leaving both outstation traders and farmers in the lurch.\n\nHarvesting is being done on 14,500 acres in Cumbum Valley spreading between Gudalur and Palanichettipatti, three km away from Theni.",
