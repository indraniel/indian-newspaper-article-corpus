Baskar said that he was keen on establishing the centre after ensuring excellence in arts and science subjects through reforms in administration, curriculum and collaboration with international institutions.\n\nBesides attracting a good number of foreign students and subsequent revenue, the MSU would also get international research projects through these measures. It would also introduce \u2018Global Internship Programmes\u2019 for students.\n\nIn order to facilitate seamless transfer of students between universities, syllabi, semester structuring and credit transfer methodologies would be restructured. This approach would facilitate the students to study one or two semesters in overseas institutions and subsequent credit transfer for the award of degree within the time duration of the programme.\n\n\u201cAll these above efforts will culminate in the formation of the \u2018Centre for International Relations\u2019 in the near future to facilitate the admission of foreign students to the MSU where they can pursue their postgraduation or research programmes and vice versa,\u201d Prof. Bhaskar said.\n\nHe also unveiled plans for extracting the expertise of foreign-based Indian origin professors under \u2018Overseas Professor Scheme\u2019 for the benefit of the MSU students and the faculty.\n\n\u201cWhenever the Indian-origin professors visit their homeland, their pedagogical skills can be effectively used for teaching, research and other academic interactions, which can ultimately lead to signing of MoUs, exchange programmes, joint publications and research projects,\u201d Prof. Baskar noted.\n\nHe also said that steps would be taken to develop integrated undergraduate and postgraduate programmes leading to Ph.D. and introduce \u2018School Exposure Programmes.\u2019",
