    "text": "Akrura\u2019s Journey, Nangiar Koothu, will take us to the childhood days of Krishna, who is considered to be the incarnation of Lord Vishnu in epics.\n\nBorn in a place called Mathura, he moved to Vrindavanam while a baby as his life was under threat from a king named Kamsa. The Nangiar Koothu starts with the thoughts of Akrura, an ardent devotee of Krishna, who travels to Vrindavanam on Kamsa\u2019s orders. Akrura is chosen to invite Krishna for the farce of an arms display with idea of killing the two.\n\nThe idea in the basic script is conveyed through an elaborate theme of intricate hand gestures.\n\nIt is possible to have a full conversation using them, without speaking a word. An actor has a full vocabulary at her command with the two hands and using 24 basic gestures either individually or in combination. These are gestures for nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and even for conjunctions.\n\nThe Nangiar Koothu will be staged in Adishakti Koothu Kovil on Monday at 7 p.m.",
