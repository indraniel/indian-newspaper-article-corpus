A Tasmac bar at Palayamkottai has also found a place in this \u2018prestigious list\u2019 by offering free Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nThough the bar is situated in a narrow lane passing through the nauseating Palayam Irrigation Channel, the facility is being offered to those who consume liquor in this bar to attract young boozers.\n\n(Contributed by P.
