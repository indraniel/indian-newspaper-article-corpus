    "text": "Shankar and Kausalya had been married for about 8 months before the tragedy struck.\n\nIn fact, Kausalya had given up her studies and had joined a private firm in Tirupur to support her husband who was in the final year of college. Her parents had opposed the marriage and had even moved the court to separate them. Since she was a major and the marriage was on mutual consent, no legal action could be initiated, sources said.\n\nOn Sunday, Sankar and Kausalya went to a departmental store in Udumalpet when the accused attacked them. Shankar suffered a grievous injury on his neck and fell unconscious on the spot. He succumbed to the injury while being rushed to the hospital.\n\nThe condition of Kausalya is said to be stable. Even as many people in the area watched in shock, the accused fled the scene on a motorcycle.\n\nA senior police official who inspected the scene of crime said one of the girl\u2019s close relatives had hired mercenaries to murder the Dalit youth. \u201cWe have detained a prime suspect who masterminded the attack. The three assailants would be apprehended soon,\u201d he said.",
