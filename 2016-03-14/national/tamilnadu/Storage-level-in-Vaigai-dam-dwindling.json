With the mercury touching 37 degree Celsius, the officials have also identified alternative sources from where water could be drawn and distributed.\n\nThe only solace is that the Corporation of Madurai has inaugurated the Cauvery integrated drinking water scheme, which has started benefitting some localities in areas such as Koodal Nagar, Avaniapuram, Silaiman, Chintamani and Iravathanallur.\n\nWary of any violation of model code of conduct, elected representatives have chosen to stay away from day-to-day administration and left decision making to the officials.\n\nThe officials are yet to take a final call on distribution of water. However, an official said they might be in a position to assess only after the water for irrigation was stopped.\n\nA PWD official said that they would release water till March end following turn-system.\n\nThe only good news is that the PWD officials recorded a rainfall of 14 mm in Periyar dam on Saturday, followed by 19.6 mm on Sunday, while the dry spell continued in other parts of the region.",
