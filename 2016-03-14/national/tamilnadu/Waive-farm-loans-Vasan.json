    "text": "The Tamil Nadu government should seek the permission of the Election Commission and ask banks to stop collection of farm loans till the Assembly polls are over, Tamil Maanila Congress president, G.K. Vasan has said.\n\n\u201cThe Election Commission should, on a war footing, grant permission for such important issues. The Central government should waive the farm loans immediately upon the conclusion of the elections,\u201d Mr. Vasan said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nMr. Vasan said farmers have been distressed due to drought, unseasonal rains and vagaries of nature. Recalling the incidents of suicide and the assault on farmers by police personnel in the past few days, Mr. Vasan said banks should follow the Supreme Court guidelines while collecting back loans.\n\nHe also said a compensation of Rs.10 lakh should be given to the farmer who committed suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, PMK\u2019s Anbumani Ramadoss, said the party would waive off all farm loans within two months if the party came to power. \u201cFrom 2011-2015, a total of 2,423 farmers have committed suicide in Tamil Nadu. Most of these suicides are due to the pressure of repayment of farm loans,\u201d he said.",
