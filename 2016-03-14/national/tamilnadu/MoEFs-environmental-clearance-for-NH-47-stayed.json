    "text": "National Green Tribunal (South Zone) in Chennai stayed the environmental clearance given by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) on March 11 for undertaking work on National Highways 47 (Kalyakavilai- Kanyakumari) through wetlands and waterbodies, said R.S. Lal Mohan, chairman, Conservation of Nature Trust, Nagercoil, here on Sunday.\n\nHearing a host of petitions, filed by the Conservation of Nature Trust and D. Sulif, secretary, NH 47 Road-Affected People Sangam, (South Zone) Judicial Member Justice P. Jyothimani and Expert Member R. Nagendran of the tribunal refrained the MoEF and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) from laying NH 47 over waterbodies.\n\nMr. Lal Mohan said that the petitions were first filed at the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court which transferred them to the South Zone bench of the NGT.\n\nThe NGT, in its order, said that the \u201cMoEF and the NHAI shall not proceed further with the National Highway projects in Kanyakumari district\u201d.\n\nThe petitioners had contended that owing to human interference, waterbodies were facing a threat. Laying four-lane road posed a threat to waterbodies as it would swallow more than 100 large tanks on its way.\n\nInstead of widening the existing NH 47 between Kalyakavilai to Kanyakumari the NHAI proposed new alignment that would pass through 80 per cent of wet and fertile agricultural lands.\n\nThey said that there was no transparency on the part of NHAI authorities as they term tanks and wetlands government poromboke lands.\n\nThe NHAI should implement the project without affecting waterbodies, he added.",
