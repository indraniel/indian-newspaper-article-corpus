He chose to drive down to NSR Road to participate in The Hindu\u2019s Car-free Sunday.\n\nHe participated in the events and also had himself caricatured. \u201cThe Car-free Sundays is also an event to make new friends,\u201d says the TVS Nagar resident. In addition to the fun and frolic, the residents also had a message for them from Siruthuli to join its efforts in cleaning River Noyyal. Entertaining the people on the Third Car-free Sunday was Beethoven\u2019s Body Zeal Fitness Studio, Ranjith Dance Academy, Avila Convent Matriculation Higher Secondary School and SNR Sons Charitable Trust.\n\nMark 1 Events was the event manager and Radio City the radio partner. The three hour-long event recorded by Radio City will be aired on Friday as a prelude for the next Sunday and to listen to the capsule of the first Car Free Sunday just tune in to 91.1\n\nThose interested in having events at Car-free Sundays can contact Madhan (9715063000) of Mark 1 Events.",
