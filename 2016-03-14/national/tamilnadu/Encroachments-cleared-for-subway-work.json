Venkatachalapathy\n\nPreliminary works for constructing a subway across the National Highway 48 at Sathuvachari have commenced.\n\nEncroachments along the service lanes on either side of the NH are being removed to enable widening of the stretches.\n\nThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had given its nod to construct a subway across the six-lane Chennai Bengaluru NH 48 at Sathuvachari (RTO Road point) following demands from residents for more than six years. Pedestrians have been facing difficulty in crossing the NH in the absence of such a facility.\n\nNow, officials said preliminary works for constructing the subway have begun, starting with removal of encroachments.\n\nThe work began nearly three to four days ago.\n\n\u201cWe are removing encroachments as per the land acquisition carried out by NHAI in 2001. Some of the shops have encroached upon the land acquired by NHAI. The drive will go on for a week,\u201d an official said.\n\nOnce the encroachments are removed, officials will shift certain utilities such as major Ponnai water pipelines and electricity lines.\n\n\u201cThe service lanes will be widened after the utilities are shifted. The service lanes will be widened from the existing six metres to eight metres,\u201d he added.\n\nOnly after the service lanes are widened will officials be able to allow local traffic to flow, and also divert the main traffic from the NH into the service lanes to commence the subway construction work, he added.",
