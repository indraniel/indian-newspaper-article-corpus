Vedhan\n\nDuring summer people ensure they get enough hydration to beat the heat. However, when street dogs and cats suffer the scorching heat, they may not always find water.\n\nThis thought gave birth to \u2018The Water Bowl Challenge\u2019. The initiative encourages people to provide water to animals, says Arun Prasanna of People for Cattle in India (PFCI) which organised the event. The challenge requires people to provide a bowl of water \u2014 at their houses, gardens, offices or on streets \u2014 to help animals quench their thirst and post a picture of this on PFCI\u2019s social media page.\n\nDuring the launch of the event on Sunday, Arun Prasanna of PFCI said, \u201cAnimals can survive without food, but not without water. During this season, we get a lot of rescue calls about animals suffering from dehydration; that\u2019s what prompted us to start such this challenge.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, when the challenge was started, the initiative did not elicit the expected response as the bowls were given free of cost and not many cared to do it. \u201cWhen we went to check how successful the challenge was, the first time, we realised that what was given freely was taken for granted and several households did not keep out water everyday,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, from the second year on, they charged Rs. 200 for a bowl. The strategy worked, as expected.",
