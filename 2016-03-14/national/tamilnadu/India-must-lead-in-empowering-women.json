M. Anjana, Joint Managing Director, Dr Mohan\u2019s Diabetes Specialities Centre, and Vice President of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation while talking at the Women Managers Convention 2016 organised by the Madras Management Association . She also said that women were not created to do what men can do. They were created to do what men can\u2019t do.\n\nRaghu Raman, Group President Risk, Security and New Ventures, Reliance Industries Ltd, said, \u201cIndia should take the lead in empowering women. If you look at history we have produced more women leaders. They have to be financially and physically independent. When life punches you on your stomach you must have the ability to flip around and stand on your feet.\u201d\n\nOver 800 women delegates from various walks of life participated in this fourteenth edition of this convention. The conference also highlighted the importance of women in leadership roles and how their roles can be fostered, promoted and secured for the next generation.\n\nIndia\u2019s first female racing champion, Alisha Abdullah, spoke about the challenges she faced when she ventured into racing, a field that was dominated by men. N. Priya Ravichandran, Deputy Director (HQ), Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services, motivated the women at the event to take up successful and challenging roles.",
