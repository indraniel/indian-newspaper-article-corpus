The Election Commission should ensure this. Otherwise, we will disrupt elections,\u201d said All Farmers Associations Coordination Committee Coordinator P.R. Pandian.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu here on Sunday on the two-day agitation seeking justice for the police assault victim G. Balan of Cholagankudikadu in this district, he said police should book Kotak Mahindra Bank agents who had assaulted Balan under criminal laws, take departmental action against errant police and halt all loan recovery proceedings against defaulting farmers till the end of elections.\n\nThe Collector N. Subbaiyan had assured us that he would direct banks to halt distraint and recovery proceedings and we welcome that direction, he said.\n\nAgitation threat\n\nHowever, the Election Commission should give orders regarding halting all loan recovery process, he said. If the EC did not intervene, farmers would launch a statewide agitation to highlight the plight of farmers. If it did not listen to our plea, farmers would not hesitate to disrupt the elections to make it see reason and issue direction to stop all loan recovery processes.\n\nWe are forced to do so as the model code of conduct is in force and the administration has to get permission of the Election Commission for all executive decisions, he said. Mr. Pandian said the Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s activities for loan recovery should be stopped.",
