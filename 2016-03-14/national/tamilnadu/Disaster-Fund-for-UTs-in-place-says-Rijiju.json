    "text": "Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said a new Union Territory Disaster Fund has been created to provide assistance to the Union Territories.\n\nWhile answering a question raised by Puducherry Rajya Sabha member N. Gokulakrishnan, Mr. Rijiju said that a Union Territory gets a grant, not matching assistance from the Central Government.\n\n\u201cThey do not have this provision. Hence, a new Union Territory Disaster Fund has been created to provide financial assistance,\u201d he said.\n\nInterim relief\n\nMr. Gokulakrishnan had questioned why the Central Government had announced only Rs. 50 crore as interim relief to Puducherry while they had asked for Rs. 491.90 crore for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction works in the aftermath of heavy rains last year.\n\nPanel to decide\n\nMr. Rijiju stated that the amount projected by the Puducherry Government, assessed by the inter-ministerial central team, would be placed before the sub-committee of the National Committee and it will also be placed before the high level committee headed by the Home Minister. \u201cA sum of Rs. 50 crore has been released to the Government of Puducherry on December 16, 2015 for providing relief to the affected people, as an interim assistance, by re-appropriating the amount from the plan head to the non-plan head. Additionally, Rs. 10 crore has been made available to Puducherry. This is the highest amount for any Union Territory,\u201d he said.",
