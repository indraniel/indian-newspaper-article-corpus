The space got into a legal entangle after one petitioner named Kandasamy claimed the title deed for the property immediately after the land was donated to the temple by D. Uma, a devotee from Coimbatore in 2010,\u201d said P. Alagesan, Avinashi temple executive officer.\n\nThe land is situated close to Vellakoil municipal office.\n\n\u201cTwo boards stating the ownership of the land has been put up now at the spot and fencing works will be completed soon,\u201d said T. Sathyamoorthy, a lawyer-activist who has been crusading for the past few years to get back all the properties belonging to Avinashi temple lying scattered in many places.",
