    "text": "Integrated multi-level car parking facilities will bring in organised parking areas and make transportation within the city easier, said K. Vijayakarthikeyan, Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner here recently.\n\nHe inaugurated a multi-level car park facility at G. Kuppuswamy Naidu Memorial Hospital. With large number of new vehicles coming to the road every month, it was a challenge for cities such as Coimbatore to meet the parking needs. The city had the demand for such facilities, he added.\n\nAccording to a press release from GKNM Hospital, the multi-level car park is an integrated puzzle parking system and the project was implemented by Seiger Spintec Equipments.\n\nIt is a five-level parking area on 2,300 sq.mt. and can accommodate 375 cars. It is a fully integrated system that is connected with the GKNM Hospital software.\n\nThe Corporation sources say that the local body, which had long ago planned multi-level car parking facilities on DB Road, Town Hall Road, and Cross Cut Road, with commercial space too, will implement the project through a concessionaire.\n\nThe concessionaire will maintain it for 30 years, including two years for implementing the project.\n\nThe capacity on DB Road will be 1,151 two wheelers and 800 cars (project cost of Rs. 31.1 crore), on Cross Cut Road it will be 316 cars and 343 two wheelers (Rs. 32 crore) and on Town Hall Road it will be 315 cars and 380 two-wheelers (Rs. 12.6 crore).",
