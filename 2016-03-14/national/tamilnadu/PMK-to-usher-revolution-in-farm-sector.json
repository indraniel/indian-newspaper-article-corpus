Farmers would be provided with free seeds, agricultural inputs and fertilizer, he said adding that competitive prices would be provided for the farm produce to raise the economic lot of the agriculturists.\n\nHe also assured of bringing in several irrigation schemes and construction of check dams at every five kilometres on rivers and rivulets to increase the ground water table. Schemes would drafted at the micro and macro levels with a long term vision in respect of the agriculture sector, he said.\n\nHe also assured of creating special agro economic zones at different places in the State and formation of farm-related cooperative clusters to provide employment opportunity to the rural youth.",
