    "text": "A one-day seminar on Enhancing the Quality of Academic Research in Higher Educational Institutions was held at VIT University recently.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, VIT Chancellor G. Viswanathan observed that the Central and State governments should recognise universities and colleges that performed well and encouraged research, according to a press release.\n\nHe said the New Education Policy, which is being laid down by T.S.R. Subramanian Committee, should give enough emphasis for attracting more students to do research in the universities. There were 2,00,000 researchers in the country, but there was a need for more.\n\nFurqan Qamar, secretary general, Association of Indian Universities, said higher education should be made flexible. Around 80 per cent of education was at the graduate level, while it was 19 per cent at the post graduate level, and one per cent at the research level.\n\nHe added that it was for the universities and colleges to increase the students at the PG and research level, the release said.\n\nUniversities asked to increase students intake at PG and research\n\nlevels",
