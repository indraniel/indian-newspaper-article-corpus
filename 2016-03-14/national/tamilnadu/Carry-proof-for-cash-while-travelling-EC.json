    "text": "With the model code of conduct in place, the special surveillance teams of the Election Commission are trying to crack down on illegal transactions to influence voters. But, commonmen and traders also seem to be hit by the drive. The Election Commission has asked people carrying large sums of cash to carry documents such as bank withdrawal receipts, and receipt books for traders.\n\n\u201cThey need to carry some record of carrying the money, the purpose for which it is intended and the source of the money. Jewellery is generally not seized,\u201d State Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission of India has issued guidelines to the CEO\u2019s of all states going to the polls for provision of facilities to persons with disabilities.\n\nApart from making polling stations disabled-friendly, the ECI has also asked the state election commissions to train electoral staff to deal with differently-abled persons, organising special camps to educate and motivate people with disabilities, use of technology and voice-assisted technology to help visually-challenged persons.",
