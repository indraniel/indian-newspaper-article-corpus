Having survived the catastrophe, the visit to India and her meeting with nature turned emotional.\n\n\u201cFor the last three years, I have been visiting India exploring the ecosystems and networking with experts working in various fields on current environmental issues, while exploring how art can act as knowledge bearer for new research. My organisation, Artlab Gnesta, has been working with art and society, particularly contemporary art in Sweden and has benefited from my long stays in India,\u201d Signe Johannessen told The Hindu .\n\nDuring her travels, Ms. Johannessen looks at tidal wetlands in India while contemplating on the fresh water wetlands in her native Sweden. Wetlands are a big and important area for conservation worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe are losing our wetlands because of forestry in Sweden. So there are many common grounds even if these are two different countries. Conservation of wetlands is a global issue and I am very happy that the art community is taking steps to talk about these very important issues,\u201d she said.\n\nAround 99 per cent of wetlands in Sweden have rapidly decreased over the last 200 years. It is considered a wasteland but it is such an important ecosystem. However, what is left is now being managed very well.\n\nThe forest department in Sweden has understood the importance of wetlands and is now taking steps for conservation. It is now a beautifully managed ecosystem and open to students and researchers.\n\nOne of the objectives of this project in the future is to invite artists and experts from different fields to talk about wetlands. This is a global issue and experts and scientists from various fields are coming together looking at a common goal.\n\nThe title Swamp Storytelling alludes to the mangroves in the Andaman Islands. The project aims to combine working the fields for scientific research and artistic production on current environmental issues, while exploring how art can act as knowledge bearer for new research.\n\nSweden and India\u2019s different preconditions are an interesting foundation for this work, Ms. Johannessen added.",
