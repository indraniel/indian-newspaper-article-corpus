The work on setting up the lab was started two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe gallery will throw light on how nuclear energy is useful for society, especially generation of electricity through nuclear energy. The generation of electricity through nuclear energy reduces the amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Less use of fossil fuels means lowering greenhouse gas emissions.",
