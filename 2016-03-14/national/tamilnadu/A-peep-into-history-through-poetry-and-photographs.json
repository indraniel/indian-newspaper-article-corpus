    "text": "At a time when political parties rely on social media as a shortcut to spread their ideals quickly, a strange combination of poetry and vintage photographs may come across as an unlikely propaganda material. But Andhigal Attra Aadhavan , a book on DMK leader M. Karunanidhi by poet Elayabharathi, seeks to achieve a dual purpose: to kindle the nostalgic moments in veteran DMK party men and introduce the youth to the bonhomie that existed among political leaders despite their differences, something unthinkable today.\n\nFor instance, a picture of former Chief Minister Kamaraj sharing the dais with DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani, one of the senior leaders of the DMK, Anbil Dharmanlingam and DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin in his teens offers a peep into the political history of Tamil Nadu.\n\n\u201cEven in the age of Twitter, nothing could strike an intimacy with a reader like a book. I have included photographs to instil in the reader a sense of history. It will conjure up the period the DMK evolved through,\u201d said Mr. Elayabharathi, whose first book was released by Mr. Karunanidhi in 1986.\n\nThe book has poems written by him over three decades. \u201cMr. Karunanidhi was very much impressed with its production,\u201d Mr. Elayabharathi said. \u201cIt will be released anytime before Mr. Karunanidhi launches his election campaign,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018Even in this age, nothing could strike an intimacy with a reader like a book\u2019",
