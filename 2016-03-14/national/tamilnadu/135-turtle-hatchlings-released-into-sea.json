Ganesalingam, Forest Range Officer, said.\n\nThey had released hatchlings from two beds, set up on January 11 and 16 in the Danushkodi hatchery, he said, adding 48 hatchlings were released from 52 eggs hatched at the first bed last week, and 135 hatchlings from 140 eggs in the second bed. \u201cThe high survival rate was very encouraging,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nR. Sivakumar, an anti-poacher who supervised the release of the hatchlings on Sunday, said that 65 eggs kept in the third bed on January 18 were expected to be hatched anytime Sunday night and they would be released into the sea at the early hours of Monday. The eggs take 40 to 50 days for hatching, he added.\n\nThe hatching would go on till the middle of May and \u201cwe are expecting high survival rate this year,\u201d Deepak Bilgi, Wildlife Warden, said.\n\nLast year, they collected about 950 eggs and achieved a survival rate of just over 50 per cent,. This time, they collected more eggs after successfully protecting them from predators, he added.",
