    "text": "Over the years, Tamil cinema has brought to us several curious genres: comedy thriller, romantic action, action drama ( Komban , for instance, is listed under this category), and now, continuing this infamous trend is Aranmanai 2 , which can only be categorised under the hybrid genre, masala horror. You can easily identify this genre by how the fleeting horror scenes in these films get diligently followed by terrible comedy scenes, and then, immediately by gratuitous skin-show by the actresses, before of course, night sets in, and it\u2019s again time for the ghost to come haunting. Just like in Aranmanai , almost all the women in the film are simply used to titillate. Trisha\u2019s opening song sees her skimpily clad in a bikini, sincerely brushing aside her top every time it seems to be covering too much skin.\n\nPoonam Bajwa plays a character called Omana Kutty; do I even need to elaborate? Only Hansika doesn\u2019t really serve up glamour, but that\u2019s because you are supposed to feel sorry for her plight.\n\nAt the end, there\u2019s even a song hilariously titled \u2018Party with the Pei \u2019, to which all the leading women dance in tribute, like \u2018Jai Ho\u2019 at the end of Slumdog Millionaire .\n\nSUDHIR SRINIVASAN\n\nAranmanai 2\n\nGenre:Masala horror\n\nDirection:Sundar C.\n\nCast:Sundar C., Trisha, Hansika, Poonam Bajwa, Siddharth\n\nStoryline:A victimised woman comes back to take revenge on her family",
