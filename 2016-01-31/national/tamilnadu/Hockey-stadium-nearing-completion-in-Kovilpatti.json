It is expected to be opened in February. Kovilpatti, a commercial town in Thoothukudi district, is known for its hockey prowess. The much awaited hockey stadium, announced by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, has been under construction at a cost of Rs.7 crore as per the regulations of International Hockey Federation.\n\nWith this new sports facility of international standards, Kovilpatti would draw global attention, C. Guru Chithra Sahanmuga Barathi, secretary, Thoothukudi District Hockey Association, told The Hindu here on Friday. The state-of-the-art astroturf hockey ground with other infrastructure facilities is coming up on a sprawling 17-acre land at the foothills of Kathiresan Temple at Alampatti village in Kovilpatti. The laying of astroturf is just a few metres away from completion and goal posts would be installed, finally. He said four floodlight towers were erected to facilitate late evening matches. A gallery to accommodate spectators, drainage system around the ground and water sprinklers installed on both sides to keep the turf wet were all in place. Besides, 15 solar panels were also installed at the stadium to cater to the energy needs.\n\nHe said Kovilpatti, home to the maximum number of hockey clubs numbering 12, was the only town in Tamil Nadu to have an astroturf hockey stadium, apart from district headquarters. Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi, Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram had such quality stadia. Next to Punjab, numerous hockey players hailed from Kovilpatti and showcased their mettle in several tournaments.\n\nWith scores of hockey enthusiasts, Kovilpatti had hosted several national-level hockey tournaments over the last 55 years and was still eager to host many more, Mr. Barathi said.\n\nBut, lack of hostel facilities on the stadium premises is a cause for concern. The sports hostel was part of the infrastructure facilities in the stadium as announced by the Chief Minister. It was essential to accommodate students, who would be responsible for the maintenance of the synthetic turf, which needs to be watered daily. If such a facility was provided, then students would be able to practise field hockey everyday apart from maintaining the turf . The astroturf ground would lose its quality and affect playing conditions, if the turf was not kept wet, he added.\n\nNext to Punjab, numerous hockey players hailed from Kovilpatti",
