Rajesh and A. Shaikmohideen\n\nIn support of their 15-point charter of demands\n\nAs many as 225 teachers including 107 women teachers affiliated to Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers Organisation (JACTO) courted arrest in Thoothukudi while staging a road roko near Collectorate on Saturday in support of their demands to be fulfilled by the State government.\n\nThe agitating teachers had been pressing for a 15-point charter of demands, including provision of enhanced salary for teachers on a par with teachers of Central government institutions.\n\nThe existing contributory pension scheme should be scrapped and old pension scheme should be implemented as promised by the State government in 2011, they said.\n\nMoreover, the protesters also sought appointment of dedicated welfare officers to disburse welfare assistance to students from primary level to higher secondary level. Currently, such assistances were provided under 14 various schemes and head masters were over burdened with the work of extending the benefits besides paying attention to teaching.\n\nMore importantly, there were no promotions for many teachers, who had worked for over 30 years.\n\nApart from promoting them, six percent hike in salary should also be given to them, the teachers demanded.\n\nIn Tirunelveli, a total of 423 teachers including 154 women teachers were arrested while attempting to block road near the junction pressing for similar demands to be fulfilled.",
