    "text": "For four years now, residents of Mogappair West have been waiting for the establishment of a comprehensive drinking water and sewerage network in their locality.\n\nThey continue to depend on private facilities as Chennai Metrowater projects are yet to be completed in their neighbourhood.\n\nMembers of JAMBA United Welfare Association, a conglomeration of associations of six areas, complained that only five per cent of the work to provide drinking water and sewerage connections was pending in the locality.\n\nThe Association secretary S.Swaminathan said: \u201cWe spend a minimum of Rs.2,000 to clear sewage through lorries every month. Metrowater has to just complete works in sewage pumping stations in Reddypalayam Road and Mogappair West.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly minimal work is pending to provide piped water supply to the households. We have made several representations in the past. But, the delay in implementing the projects continues,\u201d he said.\n\nResidents of Mogappair West submitted a memorandum at the Chennai Metrowater\u2019s head office on Friday and the officials have assured them that the schemes will be completed soon.\n\nIf the projects are not completed by March, residents plan to stage a demonstration.",
