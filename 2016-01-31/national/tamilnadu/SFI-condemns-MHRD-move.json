Anand, secretary of SFI in a statement said that MHRD\u2019s pressure on the University to submit a report should be read along with the situation in Hyderabad Central University where.a similar pressure by the MHRD resulted in the expulsion of five Dalit students forcing Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula to commit suicide.\n\nAnand termed the allegations of Islamisation as totally baseless. The MHRD\u2019s move was an attempt to subvert the educational progress made by Dalits, Muslims and other backward sections, he added further.",
