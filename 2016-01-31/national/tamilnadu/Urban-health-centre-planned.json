    "text": "A 100-bed urban community health centre is being planned near the Injambakkam hospital, said R. Kannan, deputy commissioner (health), Chennai Corporation.\n\nAt present, the hospital is run by the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services. \u201cHowever, this will soon be taken over by the Corporation,\u201d said Mr. Kannan. To add to the healthcare services of the area, the urban community health centre will offer obstetric and gynaecology as well as other necessary services, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a health centre in Uthandi as the population there does not meet the minimum necessary for an urban primary health centre,\u201d he added.\n\nFor residents however, problems persist. Dr. Renuka David, a resident of Injambakkam, said residents of both her locality and Uthandi have to travel for at least 20 minutes to get to a multi-specialty hospital. \u201cSmall health centres function in and around but for serious health problems, residents find it very difficult to access care.\u201d",
