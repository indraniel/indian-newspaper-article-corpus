    "text": "The house of former AIADMK legislator Pala. Karuppiah became a hub of political activity on Saturday with leaders of various political parties calling on him .\n\n\u201cEveryone condemned the attack and expressed their solidarity. I am touched by their words of encouragement,\u201d said Mr. Karuppiah.\n\nHis house on Besant Street off Lloyds Road was attacked on Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe women and children were rattled by the incident. People threw stones at the windows and shouted asking me to come out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile leaders, including CPI (M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan and senior leader T. K. Rangarajan, VCK\u2019s Thol Thirumavalavan, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan, senior leader K. Subbarayan and N. Periyasamy called on him, DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin and former Mayor M. Subramanian, TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan, MDMK leader Vaiko and Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K. Veeramani spoke to him over the phone.\n\n\u201cWhat touched me the most was a statement by DMK leader M. Karunanidhi who condemned the incident. I have been a severe critic of his and the support came despite all that. Mr. Mutharasan was saying that the DMK chief was a very mature person and politician and that there was no need to be surprised about the statement,\u201d Mr. Karuppiah said.\n\nWith visits by leaders of so many political leaders, the air is thick with the talk that they were all wooing Mr. Karuppiah, who was expelled from the AIADMK recently.",
