    "text": "Rejecting the allegation that the presence of the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) in the Assembly polls will only help the ruling AIADMK, senior CPI leader D. Raja said there was no basis for the argument that those who were opposed to the DMK would vote for the AIADMK; or that the anti-AIADMK sentiments would work only in favour of the DMK.\n\n\u201cPeople in Tamil Nadu are looking for a change and the PWF is a viable alternative. I do not underestimate the aspirations of the people and we will reach out to them with concrete programmes,\u201d Mr. Raja, who was here to attend the party\u2019s state executive meeting said.\n\nAsked whether the PWF was an arrangement only for the 2016 Assembly polls and would work with a long term plan, he said everything would depend on the political experience. \u201cNow we have a common minimum programme for the Assembly polls,\u201d he said.\n\nSuicide issue\n\nMr Raja said Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide could not be seen in isolation as the university had become a den of casteism.\n\n\u201cI will raise the issue in Parliament,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Raja also accused the BJP of undermining Parliamentary democracy by making announcements outside Parliament and outside the budget.",
