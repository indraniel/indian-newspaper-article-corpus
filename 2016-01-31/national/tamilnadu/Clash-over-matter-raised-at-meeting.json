    "text": "The beating of traditional \u2018thandora\u2019 dominated the proceedings at the farmers\u2019 grievances day meeting.\n\nThe farmers, who complained that the assessment of crop damage during the recent heavy downpour was not done in a foolproof manner, said that they were not informed properly about the visit of the assessment teams in advance.\n\nUsually, the officials used to inform the villagers on the visit of such teams by beating the \u2018thandora\u2019. But such practice was not adopted in any of the villages, alleged Thiagarajan of Arasanatham. At least in future, this practice should be adopted, he said.\n\nA minor clash ensued between the participating farmers over the issue as a section objected to airing grievances which had no connection with the farmers.\n\nN. Perumal, president, Salem District Vivasaya Sangam, said that the officials should ensure that only the real issues concerning the farmers alone be allowed to be raised in such meetings.\n\nHe threatened to stage a walkout from the future meetings, if people were allowed to raise issues which had nothing to do with farmers.\n\nSome of the farmers\u2019 representatives took exception to Mr. Perumal\u2019s statement and said that there was nothing wrong in raising the issues confronting the rural people.",
