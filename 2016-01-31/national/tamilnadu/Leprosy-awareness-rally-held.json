    "text": "World Leprosy Eradication Day was observed here on Saturday. Collector M. Karunakaran flagged off the rally organised to raise awareness of prevention of leprosy. The rally commenced near Lourdunathan statue in Palayamkottai. The Collector said leprosy could be diagnosed with some common symptoms such as pale, patchy spots on face, hands and feet. If left untreated it could lead to numbness in hands or legs and so care should be taken. The Dermatology Department of Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital would organise awareness programmes about leprosy, exhibition and seminars in connection with the Leprosy Week observed from January 30 to February 5. Healthcare professionals and nurses took part in the programme.",
