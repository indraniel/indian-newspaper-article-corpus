    "text": "As many as 190 persons including Colachel MLA J.G. Prince and Padmanabhapuram MLA Pushpa Leela Alban were arrested for attempting to block road in protest against the district administration\u2019s denial of permission for constructing an additional church building near the two-century-old church here on Saturday.\n\nIt was alleged that the Church authorities started construction work of an additional building without obtaining necessary permission. Hence, the residents approached the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court and obtained an interim stay against the construction. The court directed the district administration to allow construction only after the Church authorities obtained necessary permission from the concerned authorities.\n\nSo, the district administration told the Church administration to continue construction after obtaining necessary permission.\n\nThe administrators of the Church, George Ponnaiah and Henry Doss, presided over the agitation, in which the two MLAs and former MLA Kumaradoss participated.\n\nAll the arrested were kept in a private marriage hall in Kottaram and released in the evening, police sources said.",
