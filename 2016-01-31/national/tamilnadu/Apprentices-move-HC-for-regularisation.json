    "text": "Over 50 persons who have completed apprenticeship training in the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) have approached the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the corporation to formulate a scheme for absorbing them as per the amended provisions of the Apprentices Act, 1961.\n\nThe petitioners also wanted the court to declare illegal a notification issued by Tangedco on December 28, 2015 requiring them to undergo written examination for the post of Assistant Engineer.\n\nNo exams\n\nAccording to the petitioners, Tangedco was recruiting apprentices whenever vacancy arose notwithstanding the fact that there was no obligation to do so under the Apprentices Act. The recruitment process had no written examination.\n\nSubsequently, the Apprentices Act was amended mandating every employer to formulate their own policy for recruiting any apprentice who had completed training.\n\n\u201cWithout taking any steps to formulate a policy for recruiting the apprentices, Tangedco as now changed the recruitment policy. The corporation issued a notification calling for applications for the 375 posts of Assistant Engineer stating that the selection process would involve written examination and personal interview,\u201d the petitioners said.\n\nThey claimed that the new pattern of selection cannot be made applicable to apprentices as per the amended provision of the Act.\n\nJustice K. Kalyanasundaram directed the petitioners to appear for the written examination scheduled on January 31. The court, however, restrained the authorities from declaring the results of the examination till February 16.\n\nThey move the High Court questioning the need for written examination",
