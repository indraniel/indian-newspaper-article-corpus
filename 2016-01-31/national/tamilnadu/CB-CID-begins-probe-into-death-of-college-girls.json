Nagajothi inspected the college hostel and the well in Bangaram where the bodies of the three girls were found.\n\nThe team is expected to file a petition before the Kallakurichi court on Monday seeking custody of Vasuki Subramanian, administrator of the college.\n\nOn January 23, three students V. Priyanka, T. Monisha and E. Saranya reportedly committed suicide by jumping into a well over alleged harassment by the management demanding \u201cexorbitant\u201d fees.\n\nThe families of the victims have alleged that the students were murdered and their bodies dumped in the well as they had confronted the management about monetary exploitation some months ago.",
