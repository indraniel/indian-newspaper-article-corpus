Alagiri celebrated his 65{+t}{+h}birthday in the city by distributing sweets, bursting crackers and offering assistance to needy persons on Saturday, Mr. Alagiri decided not to celebrate the occasion in view of the floods in parts of the State in December last.\n\nMr. Alagiri is in Bengaluru with his family. At noon, the members had organised a feast for elders at a home in Jaihindpuram. Special prayers and pujas were also performed at the Meenakshiamman Temple and at Narasimhar Temple near Othakadai. Led by former Deputy Mayor P.M. Mannan, former MLA Ghouse Batcha and a few more councillors, they presented welfare assistance to over 500 beneficiaries at a marriage hall. A blood donation camp was also conducted. His loyalists pasted posters in many parts of the city hoping for his return into the party fold.\n\nA former MLA from Tirunelveli district said when many functionaries who were suspended from the DMK had been admitted into the party, Mr. Alagiri should rejoin the party. If the party intended to win the elections, persons like Mr. Alagiri would be essential, he said.\n\nHowever, political observers said Mr. Alagiri had been told by his well-wishers in the DMK to remain low key as his presence on the occasion of his birthday in the city or Chennai may trigger unwanted statements by his fans.\n\nWhile DMK president M. Karunanidhi is \u2018keen\u2019 to iron out the differences between his sons, it is learnt M.K. Stalin is firm not to admit his elder brother into the party.\n\nDecember floods in parts of State cited as a reason for calling off celebrations",
