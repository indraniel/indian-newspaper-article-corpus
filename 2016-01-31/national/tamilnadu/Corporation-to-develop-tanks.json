It had more than five years ago taken possession of the tanks on lease from the Public Works Department.\n\nThe transfer was for the purpose of developing the water bodies under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. But nothing significant happened until the Smart Cities initiative where the civic body has managed to make the tanks development a part of the project.\n\nBut even now the Corporation does not have the control of inlet channels of the eight tanks, all of which are interconnected. The Narasampathy tank gets River Noyyal water from the Chithirai Chavadi Anaicut through the eponymous channel. The PWD has the channel\u2019s control and therefore is in charge of its upkeep.\n\nThe Narasampathy tank\u2019s surplus water reaches the Krishnampathy tank. Water from the Krishnampathy tank feeds the Selvampathy, which in turn supplies water to the Kumarasamy tank. From Kumarasamy tank the water flows into the Selva Chinthamani tank, which in turn discharges its surplus to the Big Tank.\n\nBig Tank also gets River Noyyal water through the Coimbatore channel. Likewise, the Big Tank water reaches the Valangulam. As for the Singanallur Tank, it gets water from River Noyyal through the Singanallur Channel.\n\nGiven the fact that the tanks are interconnected, they cannot be seen as an entity different from that of the channels, says R. Raveendran, Honorary Secretary, Residents\u2019 Awareness Association of Coimbatore.\n\nThe development of tanks will have very little meaning in the absence of development of channels. The Corporation will have to take steps to clean channels, remove of those of encroachment and also mark boundaries so as to prevent future encroachments.\n\n\u201cIn short, the tanks\u2019 development will have to begin with the channels and not with tanks.\u201d\n\nVanitha Mohan, Managing Trustee, Siruthuli, says that ignoring the channels and only taking up tanks\u2019 development will have no meaning because the tanks will not get filled up when channels are choked.\n\nLikewise, before taking up its sewage treatment plant proposal for the tanks, the Corporation should provide house service connection for underground drainage as that will reduce sewage inflow in to tanks and channels. And only then the Corporation should make an assessment for the STP.\n\nPWD officials say that inclusion of channels will be good for the tanks\u2019 rejuvenation because with the money the Department gets, it has been able to carry on development for only a few km in a channel a year.\n\nBy the time they get the funds for the second year, the work carried out in the first year gets undone. If more funds are available, all the channels can be developed and protected.\n\nCorporation Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan says that the Corporation will dovetail funds from other departments or schemes and include the PWD in developing the tanks.\n\nThe Corporation will dovetail funds from other departments or schemes and include the PWD in developing the tanks",
