    "text": "New State guest house being constructed is inspired by Sydney Opera House\n\nWallajah Road will soon have another magnificent building. The new State guest house being constructed in Omandurar Government Estate is nearing completion.\n\nInspired by the Sydney Opera House, the structure, being built adjacent to the upcoming Kalai Arangam, was designed by C.R. Narayana Rao Associates. The three-storey building, with 40 rooms and three conference halls, is being built by the Public Works Department (PWD) at a cost of Rs.19 crore. This too will have disabled friendly features like ramps incorporated in it. Nearly 80 per cent of the structure \u2014 spread over 60,400 sq.ft. \u2014 has been completed so far.\n\nWhat makes it special is the design of four look-alike arches on the front and rear of the building. \u201cWe had to use plywood template to give shape to the arch design. Each curve is 30-metres high and it involved laborious work,\u201d said an official. A gigantic leaf-like tensile membrane structure, made of PVC-coated nylon fabric, will come atop the building. The existing State guest house will continue to function, officials added.",
