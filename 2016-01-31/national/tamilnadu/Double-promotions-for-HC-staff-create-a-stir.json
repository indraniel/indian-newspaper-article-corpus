Eqbal had passed an order that 50 per cent of staff vacancies in the court should be filled by way of promotions and the rest, through public notification.\n\nSubsequently, a committee comprising two judges was also constituted to consider implementing the order.\n\nHowever, when contacted, Registrar General P. Kalaiyarasan clarified that as of now there was no necessity to earmark 50 per cent of vacancies for direct recruitment since the Madras High Court Service Rules had been amended. He also said that double promotions had been given only to those employees who had completed graduation and cleared the interview conducted by Registrars.\n\nVacancies still exist\n\nEven after filling up the vacancies through promotions, a large number of vacancies still exist in the High Court.\n\n\u201cA notification calling for applications for these vacancies can be expected soon. It is not yet finalised whether the recruitment would be done by us or through Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission. But our experience is that the process gets delayed whenever it is outsourced,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201c50 per cent of vacancies should have been filled through direct recruitment\u201d",
