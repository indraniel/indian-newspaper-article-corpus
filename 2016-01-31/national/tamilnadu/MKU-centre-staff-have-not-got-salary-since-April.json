    "text": "Faculty members of Women\u2019s Studies Centre in Madurai Kamaraj University have alleged that they have not received their salary since April last year.\n\nIn a petition recently sent to the Higher Education Secretary, one of the faculty members has alleged that the university administration did not take steps to release the salary for two Assistant Professors and a Research Associate working at the centre.\n\nThe centre was set up during the Eleventh Plan of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the faculty members were appointed in 2013 during the Twelth Plan with financial assistance from the UGC.\n\nThe faculty member had alleged in the petition that instead of appointing an Associate Professor and an Assistant Professor as per the UGC guidelines, the university appointed two assistant professors with approval from the syndicate.\n\nHowever, as the selection committee report was not sent to the UGC till now, the grants were not released.\n\nMKU officials said that the university had earlier released an advance of around Rs. 23 lakh to the centre which was used till April 2015. However, the officials added that another round of advance could not be released as the centre did not have a Director authorised to handle financial matters.\n\nWhen contacted, a senior university official said that appointment of a new Director in charge for the centre was getting delayed owing to the absence of Vice-Chancellor.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are taking steps to fill the vacancy and release the salary at the earliest,\u201d he said.\n\n'Varsity did not release salary for two Assistant Professors and a Research Associate'",
