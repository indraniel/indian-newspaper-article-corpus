    "text": "A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court Bench here seeking a direction to Madurai Municipal Corporation to hand over properties endowed under the title of Kunnathur Sambian Chattram (K.S. Chattram) charities here to the Executive Officer of the Meenashi Sundareswarar Temple. Chinmaya R. Somasundaram, State joint secretary of Vishva Hindu Parishad, filed the case accusing the corporation of having failed to perform the acts for which the charities were created by the erstwhile Naick king Vijayaranga Chokkanatha Naick besides demolishing the K.S. Chattram without even consulting the HR and CE Department officials.\n\nWhen the matter came up for hearing before Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran on Wednesday, they ordered notice to the corporation returnable by two weeks. In his affidavit, the petitioner claimed that the charities were created for feeding 105 people every day and performing daily puja at the Meenashi Sundareswarar Temple among other things.\n\nPointing out that the management of the charities had been handed over to Madurai Municipality in 1872, he claimed that the purpose for which the charities were created had not been served for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the place where the majestic K.S. Chattram once stood was now being used as an open toilet and an unauthorised parking lot, he lamented.",
