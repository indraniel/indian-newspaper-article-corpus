Mr.Gopinath, planted a clove sapling.\n\nOpened in 2014, the garden now boasts of more than 100 species of medicinal plants including many rare plants that normally do not thrive under the climatic conditions of the region.\n\nIn addition, it has a collection of fruit trees, spices and other herbs.\n\n\u201cOne would be surprised to see clove, gamboj tree and pepper, which normally grow in mountainous regions with lower temperature at the garden. This is one of the largest such collection in Tiruchi. We plan to have more than 300 varieties of plants by 2017,\u201d said Francis Xaviour, President of Kerala Samajam.\n\nSaplings were sourced from various agricultural colleges and ashrams in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\nMedicinal Plants that are recommended in Ayurveda for treating a wide variety of disorders ranging from common ailments such as head ache, skin disorders and fever to more severe ones like cancer and snake bites can be found in this garden, he said.\n\n\u201cNo chemical fertilizers or pesticides are used in the garden. Even the dry leaves that fall are collected and allowed to naturally form the manure so that the entire eco system becomes a self sustaining one,\u201d said V.K. Sreekumar, secretary of Kerala Samajam.",
