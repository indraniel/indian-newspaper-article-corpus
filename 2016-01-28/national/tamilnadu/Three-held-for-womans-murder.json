Saravanan, Deputy Commissioner, T. Nagar, nabbed Saravanan (30), Suganya (25) and her cousin Pavithra (22), from Tirupur on Tuesday.\n\nBaby Ammal (70), a resident of West Mambalam, was found dead in a room at the Tamil Nadu Saliyar Mahajana Sangam lodge on Ganapathy Street, near her house. The five-sovereign chain she was wearing was missing.\n\n\u201cThe murder came to light after a foul smell began to emanate from the room. She was found dead with her legs tied,\u201d investigating policemen said. Baby Ammal used to sell idlis to occupants of the lodge. \u201cShe used to supply idlis to Saravanan, Suganya and Pavithra too. The trio had an eye on the chain she was wearing,\u201d they said.\n\nThe police circulated pamphlets with the photos of the trio. \u201cWe found that the family was from Avaniapuram in Madurai, but had later settled in Karur. Our team went there undercover, mostly in the guise of selling something, and got details about the family. Finally, we arrested them in Tirupur,\u201d said the officer.",
