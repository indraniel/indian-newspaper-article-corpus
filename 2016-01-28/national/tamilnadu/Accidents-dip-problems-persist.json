They rush to bus stops and auto stands after getting down from trains,\u201d explains P. Vijayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Railways.\n\nAccording to him, poor visibility early in the morning during the winter months is also a reason for accidents as people crossing tracks cannot spot the approaching trains.\n\nStatistics reveal that most fatal accidents take place on the stretch between St. Thomas Mount and Chennai Beach \u2014 193 people were killed last year, accounting for one-fourth of total number of fatalities in Chennai and its suburbs.",
