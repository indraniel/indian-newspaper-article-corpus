Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nVehicle users who are facing ordeal due to the poor condition of the city roads have to encounter new problem due to the presence of pits near speed breakers on arterial roads.\n\nThe Meyyanur Main Road in the multiplex theatre stretch that connects the New Bus Stand is one of the busiest in the city.\n\nPresence of commercial establishments on both sides of the road keeps the stretch busy throughout the day.\n\nHowever, road safety is a question due to the presence of a pit near the speed breaker opposite the multiplex. The speed breaker has not been marked and has been troubling two-wheeler riders for a long time.\n\nMotorists, after crossing the speed breaker, have to enter the pit and many times lose control of their vehicle. \u201cSpeed breakers should be laid by following the norms of Indian Road Congress.\n\nBut, officials had turned a blind eye to the norms and risk the road users by the unapproved size,\u201d an engineer said. He said that motorists along with pillion rider fell down many times after crossing the speed breaker and demanded that it be laid as per norms.\n\nIn the absence of reflective cautionary board about 100 metres ahead of the breaker, vehicle users failed to notice the speed breaker and pass it and enter the pit causing accident.\n\n\u201cIf a pit like this is present on the road for many days now, what is the use of celebrating road safety week,\u201d questioned an elderly citizen M. Dhamu.\n\nHe said that action should be taken against officials for not closing the pit and also for not laying the speed breaker as per the norms.",
