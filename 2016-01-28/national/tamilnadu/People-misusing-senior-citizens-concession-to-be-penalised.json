    "text": "New rail rule to come into effect from Feb 1\n\nWith increasing incidents of misuse of railway concession in fare for senior citizens, the Railway Board has decided to levy penalty on those under-aged persons misusing the concession and treat those who corner the lower berths reserved under senior citizen quota as travelling without ticket.\n\nA railway official said that in the current system, the railway was treating aged persons very leniently.\n\n\u201cWe used to collect only the difference amount between the concessional fare and non-concessional fare from people who fail to produce the proof of age (60 years for men and 58 years for women). However, many started misusing this,\u201d he said.\n\nThese under-aged people used to take a risk of taking tickets at concessional fare. Though they are made to pay the difference in fare, many a time they go scot-free in the absence of travelling ticket examiner\u2019s checking.\n\n\u201cSince there was no penalty imposed on violators to deter misuse, it resulted in more incidents of misuse of the concessional facility resulting in revenue loss to railways,\u201d the officer said.\n\nMoreover, many such people were also managing to get lower berths, reserved for senior citizens, by false declaration of age.\n\n\u201cBy doing this, these people deny genuine senior citizens the chance of getting lower berths,\u201d the official added.\n\nSuch people who misuse the senior citizens quota would be treated as travelling without ticket and penalised accordingly.\n\nThe new rule would come into effect on February 1, 2016.",
