Edwin Joe.\n\nThe construction of the building on an area of 3.23 lakh sq.ft. at an estimate Rs. 57 crore began in October 2012. It was scheduled to be completed in two years but it got delayed due to various reasons.\n\nDepartments\n\nOn completion, the new building will have departments such as cardiology, cardio thoracic, neurosurgery, neurology, plastic surgery, medical and surgical gastroenterology, nephrology and urology. Casualty, toxicology, intensive coronary care unit and intensive medical care unit will also be shifted to the new building. The centenary building will also have trauma and orthopaedic wards in addition to the existing trauma and orthopaedic wards.\n\nOperation theatres\n\nThe centenary building has 13 state-of-the-art operation theatres. It will take number of operation tables in CMCH to 44 \u2013 including 31 tables in the existing buildings \u2013 and facilitate performing more than 100 surgeries a day.\n\n\u201cWhile the existing buildings in the hospital have 1,182 beds, the hospital has more than 1,300 admissions. The additional patients occupy the floor.\n\nThe 700 beds in the new building will help in accommodating them and in meeting the unexpected increase in inflow of patients,\u201d Medical Superintendent of the hospital B. Asokan said.\n\nThe other buildings from where the wards are shifted to the new building will be utilised based on the Medical Council of India (MCI) norms, hospital authorities said.",
