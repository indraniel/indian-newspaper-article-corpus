    "text": "Three persons including a couple were killed in a freak accident on Wednesday.\n\nPeter (55), a TV mechanic and his wife Stella (45), a teacher of Ammundi near here were riding a moped. When the duo attempted to cross the National Highway at Arappakkam, a speeding Chennai bound car knocked them down.\n\nInstantly another car coming behind ran over them, killing them on the spot. At the time, another car coming behind at high speed attempted to avoid running over the already dead couple. In the attempt, the driver of the third car lost balance and crossed the median and entered other side of the road and knocked down one Arif (35) and his son Ablu (8) who were riding a moped. Both were taken to hospital and Arif succumbed to his injuries. Rathnagiri police have booked a case.",
