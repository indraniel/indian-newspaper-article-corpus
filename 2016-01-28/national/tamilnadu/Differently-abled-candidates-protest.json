    "text": "As many as 18 differently abled people, who protested outside the Secretariat, were arrested on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the Tamil Nadu Differently-abled Teachers\u2019 Association said they had written the Special Teacher\u2019s Eligibility Test (TET) in May 2014 and around 950 of them had cleared it.\n\n\u201cDespite so many of us clearing the exam, 400 of us have still not been given a posting anywhere. We had urged the government previously to take stock of the vacancies in government schools and give us jobs but nothing has been done till now,\u201d said Nagarajan, a member of the association.\n\nThey further said that many government aided schools, which had to recruit differently abled teachers, were not doing so and there were no regulations in place to keep this in check. They were let off in the evening.",
