Ravindran\n\nParties, especially those involving children, generally involve fun and games, but in some cases \u2014 as a video going viral on social media on Tuesday illustrated \u2014 unexpected mishaps can occur.\n\nVideo on social media\n\nIn the video, an excess of confetti and party foam ruins the cake, upsets the children and ultimately leads to the birthday boy coming close to sustaining severe burns.\n\nThe video, which has been shared on Facebook and is doing the rounds on WhatsApp now, has an adult spaying party foam as the birthday boy cuts the cake.\n\nWhen he bends down to blow the candles, the foam on his head catches fire.\n\nExperts say parents must be cautious when it comes to supervising children and parties and the use of products that could pose a health hazard.\n\n\u201cParty foam contains chemicals that are not good for the eye \u2014 it can become an eye irritant. Parents must be careful while using it,\u201d said Mohan Rajan, chairman, Rajan Eye Care.\n\nWarning sign on bottles\n\nParty foam is also inflammable as well as most bottles come with warning signs which instruct people not to spray it on a naked flame, which ultimately is what happens in most birthday parties as they are sprayed over candles.\n\nThe foam and confetti \u2018party poppers\u2019 come in small cylindrical containers and are available from Rs 80 to Rs 150.\n\nBalloons too are hazardous\n\nAnd its not just foam \u2013 balloons too, could pose a potential hazard.\n\n\u201cRecently, we had a case of a small child who was choking on a balloon. I believe he had seen others blow balloons and tried to do it, but had sucked it in instead of blowing into it. The parents did not know what had happened but they saw the child turn blue and rushed him to hospital where doctors removed the balloon,\u201d said Indira Jayakumar, senior consultant, emergency and intensive care, Apollo Children\u2019s Hospital. Parents must not allow children to use balloons unsupervised, she stressed.\n\n\u201cOther things that could potentially cause a hazard are decorations. Children do not know they cannot be eaten and if they are colourful, could put them in their mouth,\u201d she said.\n\nThe foam is also inflammable and the bottles come with a warning not to spray on a flame",
