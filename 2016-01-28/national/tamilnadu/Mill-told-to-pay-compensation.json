    "text": "The Dindigul District Consumer Redressal Forum here on Wednesday directed a private paper mill in Palani block to pay a compensation of Rs.19.32 lakh to two depositors.\n\nThe petitioners, Bharati and Shanmuga Sundaram of Kandiyagoundanpudur, had stated in their complaint that they sold their cultivable land and deposited Rs.3 lakh each in a paper mill at Majranallaur in 1995 under a five-year investment plan. The mill had announced that it would offer 14 per cent interest every month and pay double the deposit on maturity.\n\nAfter paying the interest for the first six months, the mill defaulted in remitting it. When the petitioners complained, the mill paid the interest once in three or four months. When it did not pay the matured money also, the petitioners registered a complaint with the consumer forum in 2007.\n\nForum president Ayyappan and members Meenambikai and Sheikh Abdul Khader directed the mill to pay a compensation of Rs.19.32 lakh to both the petitioners, including the maturity amount of Rs.6 lakh each, Rs.25,000 each for causing them mental agony and Rs.5,000 each for court and other expenses, along with interest.",
