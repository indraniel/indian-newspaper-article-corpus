Harvesting is expected to reach a feverish pace over the next few days. Samba paddy has been raised on about 34,400 hectares in the canal-irrigated delta areas and on 17,000 hectares in the non-delta areas, according to Agriculture Department.\n\nFarmers in the delta areas had started harvesting the crop. While farmers in some parts of the district complained of below average yield, sources in Agriculture Department said the yield was normal. Farmers in some pockets of Lalgudi, Tiruverumbur and a few other parts have been complaining of yield loss owing to the blast disease attack in Andhra Ponni variety, which is raised widely in the district. \u201cThe yield has been less than 20 bags in the disease affected crops,\u201d said R.Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.",
