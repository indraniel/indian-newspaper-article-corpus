Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran made it clear that the amount ordered by them shall be paid apart from interim compensation already disbursed in September 2009 and the entire quantum of money should be recovered from the salaries of the police personnel involved in the incident. \u201cThe government has a right and a duty to recover the amount from the officials through appropriate proceedings,\u201d the judges said and pointed out that a GO issued on January 20 fixing an uniform final compensation of Rs.60,000 to 191 Dalits was actually not correct. When the interim compensation had ranged between Rs.3,000 to Rs.25,000 , how can the final awrd be determined at a uniform amount of Rs.60,000 each, the judges asked.",
