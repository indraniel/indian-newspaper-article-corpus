She was one among thousands of other students who attempted the examination across the globe, the event organisers said.\n\nKarthika gave her test from Chennai.\n\nHer teacher Swati Nandy was delegated to teach her class as part of the of Teach for India fellowship programme. Ms. Nandy said: Karthika has always been willing to learn.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that she developed a special interest for mathematics and thoroughly enjoyed learning it.\u201d\n\nKarthika is among the many students coming from underprivilidged backgrounds. Her father is a daily wage earner, working for a clothing store, while her mother is a homemaker.\n\n\u201cI have spent the last two years teaching in this school as a part of the fellowship programme. The students here are inspired to learn more and it has been a great learning experience for me as a teacher. They are as motivated as students from privileged backgrounds. All they need is to be given the right opportunities and platform to exhibit their talent. This happened in Karthika\u2019s case,\u201d Ms. Swathi added.\n\nShe was one among thousands who attempted the examination across the globe",
