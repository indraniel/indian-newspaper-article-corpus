Airport sources said the DRI officers received a tip off regarding smuggling of gold and mounted a vigil along with Customs officials at the international airport. The passenger landed in Tiruchi by an Air India Express flight that came from Singapore in the afternoon and later left for Chennai.\n\nThe sources said the offence was reportedly carried out with connivance of the ground handling staff here.\n\nMurugesan, the sources said, reportedly handed over a purse containing gold biscuits to Sathyaseelan at the aero bridge to avoid detection by the Customs.\n\nBased on the tip off, the DRI officials caught the two within the airport and seized the smuggled consignment.",
