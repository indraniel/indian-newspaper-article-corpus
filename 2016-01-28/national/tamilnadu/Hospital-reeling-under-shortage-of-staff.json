Srikanth said that the housekeeping staffs are being appointed on contract basis and they change frequently.\n\nNeed for trained staff\n\nin OT\n\n\u201cWe need trained staff who will be able to handle instruments in the operation theatre. However, the frequent change of contractual workers poses a challenge while operating on patients.\n\nThe staff need at least three to six months of training but this becomes impossible when there is a constant change of personnel,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHence, we are demanding the relaxation of recruitment rules in Jipmer to meet the present demands and requirements. Jipmer having acquired the autonomous status could afford to relax certain procedures to fill these vacancies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe multi tasking staff (MTS) including sweepers, cleaners, cobblers, blacksmith, painters, carpenters, turners, fitters etc are essential to attend to the needs of patients in a hospital.\n\n1000 vacancies in MTS catefory\n\nBut, there are 1000 vacancies in this category alone. There are only 450 recruited and many are from other states.\n\nAt least 150 to 200 MTS from other states have quit their jobs.\n\n\u201cWe are going to place a request before the Jipmer director to also fill the 40 posts vacant under the compassionate category,\u201d he said.\n\nSpread over 192.2 acres, Jipmer also has a shortage of security personnel. It has only 25 security personnel employed as against the sanctioned post of 73.\n\nOf the 25 currently present, at least six personnel are retiring this year.\n\nMr. Srikanth said the recruitment rules were framed in 1970s and needs to be changed in accordance with the present situation.\n\nHe further added that they will also discuss the Seventh Pay Commission Report during the two-day meet and the cadre restructuring.\n\nThe institution has only 25 security personnel against the sanctioned post of 73",
