    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation petition seeking a direction to the State government to permit government employees to visit Katchatheevu island for St. Antony\u2019s Church festival on February 20 and 21 without insisting on No Objection Certificates (NOC) from the heads of their departments.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran rejected the plea made by P. Mary of Koodal Nagar here after observing that government servants could not go beyond the territory of the country without an NOC from the head of the department concerned as per statutory rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution to regulate their conduct.\n\nPointing out that a writ of mandamus could be issued to the State only to perform a statutory duty, the judges said that such a writ could never be issued directing the government to desist from performing its obligation as sought by the petitioner. They also stated that the PIL petitioner had no locus standi to file the case since she was not a government servant. Nevertheless, they observed that it was for the State government to regulate the procedures depending upon the sensitivity of the posts held by the government servants wanting to visit the island. In her affidavit, the petitioner had claimed that many government servants were unable to attend the church festival due to delay in obtaining the NOC from their superiors.",
