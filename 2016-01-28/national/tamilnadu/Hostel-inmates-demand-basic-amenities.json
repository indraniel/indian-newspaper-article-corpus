Traffic was disrupted for more than an hour.\n\nWith no water supply in the hostel for the past two months, students had to depend on a public tap. \u201cWe had tough time at night hours,\u201d they added.'Food was not prepared properly in the hostel. The food prepared in the morning was served to them in the afternoon and at night as well. The warden did not stay in the hostel and visited the place rarely. The hostel cook was the sole in-charge of the place, they said.\n\nWhen the inmates lodged a complaint with authorities concerned, the warden threatened them and even went to the extent of assaulting them, the students alleged.\n\nThe food prepared in the morning was served to them in the afternoon and at night as well",
