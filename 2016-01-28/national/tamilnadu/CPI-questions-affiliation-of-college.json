Narayana has demanded a probe into how SVS College of Naturopathy and Yoga Science was granted affiliation by the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University and Medical Council of India (MCI) without proper infrastructure.\n\nTalking to reporters after meeting students at the Government Medical College and Hospital at Mundiyambakkam on Wednesday, Mr. Narayana said it was surprising that authorities had failed to take notice of the alleged irregularities and lack of infrastructure.\n\nMr. Narayana said that the presence of injuries on the bodies of the victims indicates foul play and it was not a case of suicide. He wanted the State government to provide a compensation of Rs.25 lakh to the families of the victims and alter the sections in the case to murder.",
