    "text": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to pay an interim compensation of Rs. 2 lakh to a man who was mistakenly confined in prison for four years.\n\nHe had to serve a life sentence in a crime in which he was acquitted.\n\nThe Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and P.N. Prakash gave the direction while disposing of a habeas corpus petition moved by Reegan, son of the murder convict Pakkirisamy.\n\nRelying on a Supreme Court judgement, the Bench said, \u201cIt will be in the fitness of things if the State government is directed to pay within four weeks, an interim compensation of Rs.2 lakh to Pakkirisamy for having suffered illegal detention for a period of four years, seven months and seven days, that too, without prejudice to his right to sue for damages in the Civil Court.\u201d\n\nSentence was suspended\n\nPakkirisamy, his son Annadurai and wife Rani were tried by Additional Sessions Judge Nagapattinam in a murder case.\n\nOn October 10, 2001 the trio were convicted.\n\nThe trio preferred an appeal in 2002 before the High Court which suspended their sentences and released them on bail.\n\nLater the High Court acquitted Pakkirisamy of the murder charge and set aside the sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nBut mistakenly, he was apprehended and remanded in custody for undergoing the unexpired portion of the sentence.\n\nSubsequent to filing of the present petition, Pakkirisamy was released.",
