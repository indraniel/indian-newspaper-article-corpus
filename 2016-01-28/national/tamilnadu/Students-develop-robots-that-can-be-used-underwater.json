    "text": "Students of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing in Kanchepuram have developed mobile application-controlled robots that can be used underwater or operated by remote on surface.\n\nOn Tuesday, students presented their innovation to an audience comprising schoolchildren, who were allowed to operate the robots.\n\nThey could control the robot\u2019s movement using a video game controller. An underwater robot, a remotely operated vehicle, was operated in the water tank in the institute. The children could operate the remote through the internet too, said Institute director R. Gnanamoorthy.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to promote affordable robots that can be introduced at an early age to encourage playful learning process. This will help spread technology literacy,\u201d Prof. Gnanamoorthy said.\n\nProgramme coordinator S.R. Pandian, who is the faculty involved in the projects, said the next stage is to make the mobile robot autonomous and use it to pick up trash on the campus, he said.\n\nGrant\n\n\u201cWe have received a grant of Rs. 1.95 crore for setting up a teaching learning centre for design and manufacturing education. We are thinking of taking it to schools as part of our outreach programme. We embarked on this idea as children don\u2019t have enough knowledge of robots,\u201d he said.\n\nThe institute plans to conduct workshop for teachers enabling them to work on these basic technology.",
