A special purpose vehicle would be formed for the same and technology would be provided by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai.\n\n\u201cInitially, Teynampet zone will be taken up. There are 130 restaurants here and they generate 60 tonnes of food waste a day. We have set March 31 as the deadline and if steps are not taken, we will initiate action. The Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules have provisions regarding regulation of food waste for action,\u201d said an official.\n\nBased on the principle of \u2018polluter pays,\u2019 food waste should be collected and disposed of safely by hotels that were responsible for the waste, said the official, adding that hotel and restaurant owners would also have to bear the cost of transporting the waste. Hoteliers had been asked to install a biogas plant.\n\n\u201cIf need be, the Chennai Corporation will provide space for the plant. We are awaiting a proposal from the TNPCB,\u201d said a source in the civic body.\n\nFood waste forms around 16 per cent of municipal solid waste and also leads to formation of landfill gas that can cause fires in landfills. \u201cSuch waste too leads to formation of leachate,\u201d an expert said.\n\nBARC is already working on biogas plants that are capable of producing about 100 kilograms of organic manure and generate up to 100 units of electricity or methane gas equivalent to more than two domestic Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinders from every tonne of biodegradable waste.\n\nBased on \u2018polluter pays\u2019 concept, food waste must be collected and disposed of safely",
