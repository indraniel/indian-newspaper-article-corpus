Shah, co-founder and director, patient services, NephroPlus, a dialysis centre network.\n\nMr. Shah, who was delivering the Mrs. Malathi Venkatesan TANKER Foundation Memorial Lecture on Monday, said he had been on dialysis for 18-and-a-half years. \u201cI work fulltime, I swim every morning, I go for movies and I travel. There are many misconceptions about dialysis -- people think it is almost the end of life, that they have to be bedridden or that they will be weak or tired all the time. But it does not have to be that way,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking the audience through his journey with kidney disease, Mr. Shah urged patients to condition their minds to be cheerful and to get as much dialysis as they possibly could. \u201cChronic kidney disease affects many parts of the body, but the most important part affected is the mind. We need to develop a positive outlook and fight the disease,\u201d he said.\n\nVikram Kapur, managing director, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, expressed his hope that TANKER\u2019s services would expand to the rest of the country. The event also saw the distribution of TANKER's awards. The Muthoot M. George Memorial TANKER and Kerala Kidney Research Foundation Young Investigator Award was given to Pinaki Mukhopadhyay; the Renny Abraham TANKER Foundation Love for Service Award was given to Nandakumar Menon and Shylaja Devi; the La Renon TANKER Foundation Lifetime Achievement Awards were given to N. Gopalakrishnan and M. Thomas Mathew; the K. Venkatanarayana TANKER Foundation Awareness Award was given to V. Mohan \u2014 all medical professionals.\n\nThe La Renon TANKER Foundation for the Sake of Honour Award was given to Mr. Shah.",
