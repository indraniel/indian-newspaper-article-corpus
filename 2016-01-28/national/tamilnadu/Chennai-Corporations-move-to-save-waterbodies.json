Vedhan\n\nChennai Corporation has started using novel methods to protect the few remaining waterbodies that come under its jurisdiction.\n\nIt will use a special mixture comprising high-density polyethylene cells filled with mud to cover the bund in an attempt to prevent encroachments, officials said. Chennai Corporation initiated this project to prevent encroachment following an observation by the Madras High Court that the heavy loss the city sustained during the floods was due to poor preservation of its waterbodies.\n\nWork using this technology, often referred to as \u2018bio-sloping\u2019 and reported to be adopted in other countries, was launched to rejuvenate waterbodies like Haridas and Thiruveedhiamman ponds in Kolathur. There have been some positive results, Corporation officials said.\n\nCivic body officials in each of the wards are likely to start screening of dried up or unused waterbodies to explore the prospects of rejuvenating them. The initiative is also expected to prevent encroachment on small waterbodies.\n\nOfficials recalled that the High Court recently dismissed a public interest litigation seeking a direction to issue pattas to families who had allegedly encroached on dried up or unused lakes and waterbodies at Kolathur.",
