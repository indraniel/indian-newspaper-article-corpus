This has angered many Islamic groups, including Sunnath Jamath Federation of Coimbatore District (a federation of 70 Jamaths in the district) which filed a petition against TNTJ claiming that it had \u201churt the sentiments\u201d by speaking against certain mosques and other religious practices of a section of the community.\n\nWhile TNTJ\u2019s state president Fakir Mohammed Al-Thafi maintained that the outfit is only spreading the \u2018right Islam\u2019, other Muslim outfits claimed that such a conference would only create more divisions within the community and between other religious communities in Tamil Nadu. \u201cWe are against dargah worship, astrology and other superstitious beliefs because they are not Islamic. Those who are opposing it are doing so to safeguard their financial interests and people are being exploited. We are confident that the courts and the law enforcement agencies will give us police protection and let us conduct the conference,\u201d said Fakir Mohammaed Al-Thafi.\n\nStating that the opposing Muslim groups are right in saying that \u201cwe are trying to promote one form of Islam\u201d, he said that the outfit is doing it because it believed that this is the right way of practicing the faith. \u201cJust because there is a tradition, we don\u2019t have to continue to follow it. What\u2019s there in the Holy Koran is the right form of Islam,\u201d he added.\n\nIndian National League leader J. Abdul Rahim said that any talk of \u2018eradicating shirk\u2019 is not possible without discussing anti-idol worship message of Islam.\n\nThameemun Ansari, general secretary, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, made it clear that the party would not get involved or take sides in controversial religious debates taking place within the community.",
