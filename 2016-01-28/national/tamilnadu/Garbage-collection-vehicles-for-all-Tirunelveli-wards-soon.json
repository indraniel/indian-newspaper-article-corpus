    "text": "It will minimise health hazard faced by workers: Corporation Commissioner\n\nThe Tirunelveli Corporation plans to introduce battery-operated garbage collection vehicles in all the 55 wards.\n\nAs per the present arrangement, the sanitary worker pushes the garbage collection trolley manually through the streets and blows a whistle. The residents, after segregating degradable and non-degradable waste at home, empty the garbage in the trolley.\n\nSince the sanitary workers face the risk of getting exposed to hazardous materials while handling the garbage collected from houses and business establishments, the Corporation has decided to replace the trolleys with battery-operated vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe sanitary worker who drives the vehicle will blow a whistle to alert the residents, who will dump the waste in the vehicle themselves. The quantum of risk or health hazard the sanitary worker faces gets minimised. Moreover, his self-esteem will certainly go up though he is collecting garbage,\u201d said S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner.\n\nRs. 2.50 lakh each\n\nThe company fabricating it has supplied a vehicle, costing Rs. 2.50 lakh, to the civic body to use it on a trial basis.\n\n\u201cOur sanitary workers use it to clear garbage from Tirunelveli Junction bus stand and Venthankulam new bus stand. It\u2019s good and effective,\u201d said a sanitary inspector of Thatchanallur Zone.\n\nAs the Corporation plans to buy 55 vehicles, the cost of the vehicle is likely to come down.",
