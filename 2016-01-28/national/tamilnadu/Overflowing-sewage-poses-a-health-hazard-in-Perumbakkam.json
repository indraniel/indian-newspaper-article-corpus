Complaints to Perumbakkam village panchayat were ignored and staff informed them that the sewage overflow was from the neighbouring Medavakkam village panchayat, residents alleged.\n\nHighways officials said they have a proposal to complete the storm water drain network along with road-relaying work. But it was local bodies\u2019 responsibility to keep them clean.\n\nResidents said during the monsoon, the road was cut off for traffic for more than one week. But this problem persists forever, due to indifferent attitude by government agencies.\n\nThe improper planning and execution of basic infrastructure works was harming them, residents said and added the government agencies responsible should own up and put an end to the menace.\n\nResidents allege no measures have been taken to to address sewage overflow",
