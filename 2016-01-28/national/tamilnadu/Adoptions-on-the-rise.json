These include children who have lost their parents, abandoned children, and those whose parents are affected by HIV.\n\nEvery year, on an average, at least 10 children are adopted and couples from other districts can also adopt from here, says Vanitha Rangaraj, founder of Sharanalayam. With better awareness, there are more parents who are adopting children.\n\nMost of the parents prefer to adopt infants and they should be able to submit all the documents.\n\n\u201cIn the case of couples whose monthly income is less than Rs. 10,000, we counsel them to adopt a child after increasing their income,\u201d she says.\n\nThough there are couples with children who want to adopt a child, priority is to those who do not have children.\n\nThough the wait is long for those who want to adopt, the number of children who are abandoned or orphaned is also the rise, she says. There is an increase in the number of children who have no one to take care of them because their parents have committed a crime and are in the prison, and children whose parents are affected by HIV.",
