The World Bank agreed to continue support and lend assistance to the reconstruction of the Mairie.\n\nThe reconstruction has now sparked a debate among stakeholders and decision makers in the State-Level Heritage Conservation Advisory Committee (SLHAC), dividing opinion on whether to use the traditional brick and lime-mortar construction as in the original or reconstruct the Mairie as a Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) framed structure with a new foundation. While the proposal for reconstruction by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Puducherry, chapter recommends using traditional materials, the proposal by the Public Works Department recommends an RCC structure.\n\nExamples of reconstruction\n\nSays S. Kothandaraman, Professor of Civil Engineering Pondicherry Engineering College and member, SLHAC, \u201cIf appropriate specifications are drawn and construction procedure is followed, the safety, serviceability, ductility, durability and sustainability of the RCC structure could be ensured simultaneously. Modern building materials are flexible to accommodate any desired form, shape and finish. Today, we have enough trained artisans with expertise on material for heritage finish. With the blend of the above, the Mairie could be given a robust rebirth for the benefit of Puducherrians.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, those in favour of traditional materials cite the example of the 55 Window Palace in Bhaktapur, Nepal, which suffered immense damage in an earthquake in 1934.\n\nIt was rebuilt, and then once again reconstructed in 2006 using traditional craftsmanship reviving not just local traditional crafts but the local economy as well.\n\nThey also cite the St Mark\u2019s Campanile, Venice, which was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. Closer home, they cite the reconstruction work of a palace in Anegudi near Hampi, Karnataka, involving architects Nilesh Thakkar and Ravi Gundu Rao, using lime mortar and Madras terrace roofing. \u201cPuducherry itself is not new to restoration using traditional materials as seen with Aayi Mandapam, poet Subramanya Bharati\u2019s museum and the Old Court building,\u201d says A. Arul, senior architect, INTACH.\n\nAccording to SLHAC member and architect Devangi Ramakrishnan of Urban Design Collective, \u201cThere are many examples around the world of adaptive reuse of heritage buildings that successfully incorporate modern infrastructure with traditional building techniques.\u201d\n\nA meeting on the future use of the Mairie building, attended by architects, residents, students, INTACH and civil and cultural organisations, arrived at the consensus that the Mairie should be a multi-functional site, active and accessible throughout the year, with public and cultural events.\n\nSunaina Mandeen of citizens group, People for Pondicherry\u2019s Heritage, says that materials used in a building contain \u2018atmosphere\u2019 and are not \u2018dead.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark of our French heritage. It has to be reconstructed with traditional materials following the original design which is in keeping with ASI guidelines, keeping in mind its adaptive reuse,\u201d says Ms. Mandeen.\n\n\u201cThe Mairie, if reconstructed using long-lasting traditional materials, can be an example and legacy for projects in other places,\u201d says Mr. Arul.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Mairie poses not just a challenge, but the opportunity to set precedence for future heritage reconstruction projects across the country.\n\n\u2018Puducherry not new to restoration using traditional materials as seen with Aayi Mandapam\u2019",
