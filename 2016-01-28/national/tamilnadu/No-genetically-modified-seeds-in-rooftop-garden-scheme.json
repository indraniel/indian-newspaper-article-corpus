It has no basis. We have distributed hybrid varieties as per order issued by our department as farmers in the State have been using only hybrid varieties,\u201d said L. Sitherasenan, director, Horticulture and Plantation Crops.\n\nThe department has selected short duration and nutritious vegetable crops including bhendi, bush type lab, radish, palak, coriander, arakeerai and thandukeerai for \u201cDo it yourself\u201d scheme aimed at promoting vegetable cultivation in urban areas.\n\nSeeds of bhendi, bush type lab, \u2018arakeerai\u2019 and \u2018thandukeerai\u2019 were procured from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) while coriander, palak and radish seeds were sourced from private sector. \u2018Arakeerai\u2019 can be harvested in 30 days, \u2018thandukeerai\u2019 in 40 days, radish in 45 days, palak in 35 days and coriander in 30 days.\n\n\u201cThey are less prone to pests and diseases.
