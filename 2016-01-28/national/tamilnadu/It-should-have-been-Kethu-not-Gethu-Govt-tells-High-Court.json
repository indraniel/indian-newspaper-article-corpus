    "text": "The Tamil film \u2018 Gethu \u2019 in which DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin\u2019s son Udhayanidhi Stalin plays the lead, was denied entertainment tax exemption for misspelling the title in English, the State government informed the Madras High Court on Wednesday. The government contended that the correct spelling of the title in English was \u2018 Kethu \u2019.\n\nAs per Government policy, films which have a Tamil title are granted entertainment tax exemption.\n\nThe producer of the film, Red Giant Movies, challenged the government decision in the High Court.\n\nPhonetically different\n\nThe government counsel contended that \u2018 Kethu \u2019 and \u2018 Gethu \u2019 are phonetically different words.\n\nThe word preferred by the petitioner in the application for exemption does not phonetically refer a Tamil word. The counsel sought time to file a counter affidavit.\n\nCounsel for the petitioner argued that the phonetic correctness of the words spelled in English is not the subject matter of the plea.\n\n\u201cThe subject matter is to decide whether the title is a Tamil word or not,\u201d he added. Recording the submission, Justice R. Mahadevan posted the matter on January 29 for filing counter.\n\nThe judge added that the petition will be disposed of on the same day.\n\nAll the six officials sitting on the government\u2019s panel, which decides whether a Tamil film qualifies for entertainment tax exemption, had unanimously concurred that the film cannot be given an exemption because the title \u2018 Gethu \u2019 is not a Tamil word. The entertainment tax amounts to 30 per cent of a film\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe tax tangle\n\nAsked about the government\u2019s stand, Udhaynidhi Stalin said as the matter was sub judice he preferred not to comment.\n\nIn the past when his films were denied entertainment tax exemption, he had claimed that it was due to political vendetta.\n\nWhile questions have been raised about some of the decisions taken by government panel in dealing with various film titles, another case is pending in the Madras High Court about who should benefit from the tax exemption \u2013 the producers, theatre owners and distributors or the paying public?\n\nIf the benefit it to be passed on to the consumer, then the ticket for an entertainment tax exempted film must be sold at 30 per cent less than its actual price.\n\nThe theatre owners have challenged such a contention.\n\n(Inputs from Sangeetha Kandavel)",
