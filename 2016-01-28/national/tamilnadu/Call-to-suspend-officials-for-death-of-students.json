The post-mortem of bodies should be performed by a team of doctors from outside Villupuram district and videographed. \u201cThe bodies should only be buried and not cremated,\u201d it said.\n\nPeople\u2019s Watch wanted the Chairperson of the State Human Rights Commission to immediately intervene in the matter and ensure that all students of the college were transferred to other government colleges at State cost. The government should ensure that all vacancies in colleges were filled up immediately, \u201cgiving no more reasons for harassment and the subsequent murder/suicide of young students from vulnerable communities.\u201d Officials of higher education should ensure that there was no discrimination, victimisation, unfavourable treatment and harassment in institutions of higher learning.",
