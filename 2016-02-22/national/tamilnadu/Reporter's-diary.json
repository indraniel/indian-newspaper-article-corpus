    "text": "When Tirunelveli Corporation\u2019s council meeting was scheduled at 11 a.m. on Tuesday last, all officials, including Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian, City Engineer V. Narayanan Nair and Assistant Executive Engineers occupied their seats at 10.45 a.m. itself.\n\nA good number of reporters also entered the hall at 10.50 a.m.\n\nWhen the clock in the council hall showed 11 a.m., only 13 councillors occupied their seats in the 55-member council.\n\nAs there was no quorum, the council meeting could not be commenced and the agonising wait for the councillors continued.\n\nWhen the AIADMK councillors, after attending a party meeting, entered the council hall, it was 11.45 a.m.\n\nHowever, the meeting, after witnessing a few unsavoury scenes and heated argument between Mayor E. Bhuvaneshwari and members of the DMK and the DMDK, came to an end within the next 15 minutes without any discussion on the proposals placed before the council.\n\n(CONTRIBUTED BY P. SUDHAKAR)",
