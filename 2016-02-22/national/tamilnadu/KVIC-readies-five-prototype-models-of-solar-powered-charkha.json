VIMAL KUMAR\n\nAfter a prolonged research, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has now readied five prototype models of \u2018solar-powered charkha (spinning wheel used for producing yarn) for its introduction in the country.\n\nThe gadgets are developed with the objectives of reducing human drudgery, which otherwise happen when using hand spinning wheel (hand-operated charkha), and subsequently increase the productivity and earnings of traditional artisans using \u2018clean energy\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe models are developed with the technical support of three agencies namely Udyog Bharati under Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Board at Gondal; Khadi Gramodhyog Prayog Samithi, a research institute founded by one of the close relatives of Mahatma Gandhi at Ahmedabad; and a private institution in Ludhiana\u201d, R. Siddharthan, Development Officer of KVIC, told The Hindu . According to him, the Union MSME Ministry has given the in-principle permission for introducing the solar-powered charkha.\n\nThe three agencies involved in the research will be the suppliers of the gadget, once the guidelines for charkha scheme was finalised, and the artisans/entrepreneurs could buy the same by availing the loans available under the Prime Minister\u2019s Employment Generation Programme. On the advantages of the charkha, Mr. Siddharthan pointed out that the appliance would help the artisans to operate even up to 24 spindles against a maximum of eight spindles when operating the charkha by hand.\n\nThis automatically improves the output and increase the per capita earnings, he added.\n\nBeing solar-powered, there will not be any carbon footprint.",
