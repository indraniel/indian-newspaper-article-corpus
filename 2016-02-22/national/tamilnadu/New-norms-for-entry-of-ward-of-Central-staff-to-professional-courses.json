The amended clause will take effect from the ensuing academic year 2016-17.\n\nWelcoming the new amendment brought by the government, V. Balasubramaniam, president of Puducherry State Students Parents Welfare Association said, \u201cBy introducing new clause, the government puts full stop to the misuse of the one-year criteria by several central government employees.\u201d\n\nHe also urged the government to scrap the provision enabling the wards of Indian origin French nationals to the admissions.",
