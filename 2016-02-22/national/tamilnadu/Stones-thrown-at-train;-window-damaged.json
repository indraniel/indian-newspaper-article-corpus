    "text": "A window pane of an air-conditioned coach of Coimbatore-Chennai Intercity Superfast Express was reportedly damaged due to stone pelting by miscreants on Sunday evening when the train was approaching the Cauvery Overbridge.\n\nHowever, there was no injury to any passenger. The damage to the window pane of C-7 coach was taken note of at the Salem station. But the onward journey was not disrupted. A Railway police team rushed to the spot for investigations.\n\nStone pelting incidents are being reported at periodic intervals in the Tirupur-Erode sector, and the Railway Protection Force has been doing its part to sensitise residents of villages on the sides of the track to the dangers of the act.\n\nThe police have so far not been able to establish if such acts were handiwork of mischievous children or anti-socials or drunkards.\n\nThe difficulty for the police is that such incidents are not confined to any particular place.\n\n\u201cThe stone pelting could turn dangerous to the passengers. It is indeed difficult to narrow down on the culprits. The Railway Protection Force has been creating awareness among people and are taking the support of elders in villages to prevent such occurrences,\u201d said Divisional Railway Manager Shubhranshu.\n\nNo injury to any passenger. The damage was taken note of at the Salem station",
