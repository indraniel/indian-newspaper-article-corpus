    "text": "Padma (30) looks worried while preparing a list of things her family needs for this week, at her flat in Ezhil Nagar, the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board\u2019s resettlement locality in Perumbakkam. As usual, she is left with no other option but to borrow money.\n\n\u201cLife has been difficult after we moved in here. We have run into debts without a job,\u201d she says. Padma\u2019s family is among 100 others who moved into Perumbakkam\u2019s slum board tenements after their houses in Puthu Nagar, Tambaram, were washed away in the December floods. Ever since they resettled, the families have been awaiting the flood relief amount which was promised to them, two months ago. \u201cWe could have stayed back in Puthu Nagar and done odd jobs, earning a little. But, even that is not possible here,\u201d says S. Muthukumaran. The government had announced compensation to families who lost their homes during the December floods. However, says Muthukumaran, over 100 families from Puthu Nagar, who were among the first to be shifted here, are yet to receive it.\n\nAccording to V.Marimuthu, a resident, they managed to draw the attention of the Kancheepuram Collector during a grievance meeting last week. \u201cHe took notice of our plight and has directed the revenue department to sanction the money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere must have been some confusion and hence the delay. We will make sure that the families receive their due compensation,\u201d officials at the Collectorate told The Hindu.",
