    "text": "Chennai-Periyapalayam High Road, a key highway out of the State, is in a deplorable condition\n\nUnlike their colleagues in many other areas of the city who always have to bother about rash driving, policemen on duty at the check point in Pakkam village on Chennai-Periyapalayam High Road, a State Highway (SH 50A) are relaxed.\n\nPotholes on this severely damaged road make it simply impossible for motorists to drive fast and hence, there is no fear of them speeding.\n\nMotorists from Avadi, Pattabiram, Tirunindravur, Sekkadu, Tamaraipakkam and Tirumullavoyal use the stretch to reach interior areas in the neighbourhood.\n\nMore importantly, the road connects the city with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe road is also used by container trucks operating between the industrial manufacturing cluster units in Sriperambadur, Oragadam and Irungattukottai.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, a motorcyclist was injured after he skidded on a huge pothole on the stretch near the police check-point and was admitted to a government hospital in Avadi,\u201d said K. Shanmugam, a motorist from Tirunindravur.\n\nMotorists said the condition of the road worsened after the rains and it had now become risky stretch to drive on.\n\nThe State Highways Department has not re-laid the damaged spots, forcing residents to initiate temporary measures like filling potholes with construction debris.\n\nAdding to the woes of motorists and pedestrians, the Chennai-Periyapalayam High Road between Tirunindravur and Thamaraipakkam Koot Road, a distance of around 15 kms, lacked adequate lighting, motorists complained. Highways officials said plans had been drawn up to re-lay the stretch and also provide enough illumination.",
