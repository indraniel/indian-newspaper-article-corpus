Krishnamoorthy flagged off the campaign near Kamaraj College in the presence of office-bearers of unorganised sector labourers\u2019 associations.\n\nThe workers formed a human chain along the Tiruchendur Road.\n\nAfter visiting the gypsies living near the new bus-stand, the campaigners visited the coastal hamlet of Keezha Vaippaar. The campaign will conclude in Chennai on March 1.\n\nhe campaigners said the State and the Central governments should give their lands near coastal areas to salt pan workers on lease so as to enable them to form their own salt manufacturing units. Salt pan workers should be given free house sites, relief during monsoon and form a separate welfare board to take care of them.\n\nThe rescued bonded labourers should be given 2 acres to carryout farming operations, the campaigners said.",
