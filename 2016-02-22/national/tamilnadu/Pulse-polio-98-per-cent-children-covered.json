    "text": "As many as 3,14,449 children aged below five (98 per cent) were covered in the second leg of the nation-wide pulse polio vaccination drive in Coimbatore on Sunday, said Deputy Director of Health Services S. Somasundaram here. \u201cThose left out will be covered in the door-to-door driver in the next two days,\u201d he said.\n\nMunicipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani inaugurated the drive at the health camp at Valparai, and Coimbatore Mayor P. Rajkumar in the city. More than 6,000 people at 1,581 booths provided the vaccination. Booths were put up at bus stands, places of worships, and toll plazas.\n\nSET examination\n\nHundreds of candidates wrote the State Eligibility Test (SET) \u2013 2016 for the post of Assistant Professor in Coimbatore on Sunday. But the number of candidates was less compared to those who wrote the National Eligibility Test, as the fees for the examination was very high. Candidates expressed disappointment as they were not provided with the carbon copy of the OMR sheets or the question paper this time. A. Divya, a literature graduate, said that this would make it difficult to check if they had written the correct answers.",
