Narayanan, director of the organisation that has been campaigning for abolition of manual scavenging, has quoted The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.\n\nThe letter quotes from Section 7 of the Act: \u201cNo person, local authority or any agency shall engage or employ, either directly or indirectly, any person for hazardous cleaning of a sewer or a septic tank.\u201d\n\nHe has further asked the authorities to stop engaging workers directly or through contractors for cleaning of sewers. The AAI has responded to the letter from CHANGEindia saying all possible measures will be initiated to improve the facilities.\n\nThough the airport has been modernised, the authorities noted that the practise had been carried out in a few areas as the sewer lines had become quite old; they also said the that work to install new sewer lines had begun and would be completed soon.\n\nFour men had died of asphyxiation in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam while cleaning a septic tank last month.\n\nThe modernisation of the airport, carried out a few years ago at about Rs. 2,000 crore, included construction of a new domestic terminal and expansion of the new international terminal, extension of secondary runway and construction of a new fire station.\n\nCHANGEindia asked the AAI to stop engaging workers for cleaning of sewers",
