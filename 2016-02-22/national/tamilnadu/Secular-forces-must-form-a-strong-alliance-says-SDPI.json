    "text": "All secular forces should unite and form a strong alliance, as done in Bihar, to contest in the forthcoming Assembly election, and defeat communal forces, said Tehlan Baqavi, State president of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).\n\nTalking to press persons before taking part in the party functionaries\u2019 meeting here on Sunday, he said that Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam leader Vijaykant should not have ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nIf he contested the election without the support of the BJP, the chances of minorities extending support to his party were very bright.\n\nHe said that his party had been holding talks with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on seat sharing for the assembly election.\n\n\u201cWe will announce about the alliance within a few days. We will support the parties which wished to offer more reservation to minorities. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam did not fulfil its electoral promises. It did nothing for the welfare of minorities. Not even a single scheme was executed for the benefit of minorities in the last four and a half years,\u201d he charged.\n\nSeveral announcements made under Rule 110 in the Assembly were nothing but mere announcements.\n\nHe demanded a white paper on the status of various schemes announced this way.\n\nStating that administration was completely paralysed in the district, he said that drinking water was supplied to Dindigul residents only once in 15 or 20 days, and roads were highly damaged.",
