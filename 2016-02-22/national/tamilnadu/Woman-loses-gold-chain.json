Rajathi, of Keezha Panangadi at Narimedu on Saturday.\n\nRajathi was on her way to the anganwadi through Thomas Street in Narimedu when she was intercepted by the three persons.\n\nIntroducing themselves as policemen, they claimed that there was some unrest in nearby areas and warned her against wearing jewellery.\n\nWhen the woman tried to remove her gold chain and keep it in a purse, one of them advised her against it. Instead he offered to help her in wrapping the gold chain in a piece of paper and handed it over to her.\n\nAfter walking for some distance, the woman realised that she was duped when she found the gold missing from the paper.\n\nTallakulam police are investigating.",
