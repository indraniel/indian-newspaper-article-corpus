Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nMembers of the Old Students Association of CSI School in the city set a worthy example by creating awareness among road users on the importance of strictly adhering to traffic rules and also not polluting the environment.\n\nThe alumni of the school gathered at the Four Roads Junction and Hasthampatti roundabout and distributed pamphlets explaining the importance of strictly following road rules.\n\nThe pamphlets urged the two-wheeler and pillion riders to wear helmets; not to use mobile phones while riding and driving vehicles; avoid speeding and drunken driving; not to jump the signals; not to overtake at the curves, bridges, narrow roads; maintain proper minimum distance between two vehicles; avoid applying sudden brake; park the vehicles only in areas marked for parking lots and always give way for ambulance and fire brigades.\n\nLed by S. Balavinayagam, president of the Old Students Association, they also distributed pollution masks to the two-wheeler riders to protect themselves from the pollution.\n\nA group of volunteers stuck the bull\u2019s eye stickers on the headlights of vehicles at both the junctions.\n\nAccording to N. Jagadeesan, vice-president of the CSI Old Students Association and administrative manager, Ramaraj Group, more than 10,000 pollution masks were distributed to the two-wheeler riders. Similar initiatives would be taken at regular intervals during holidays with the cooperation of the public, he said.",
