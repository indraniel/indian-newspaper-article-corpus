    "text": "Actor Sarath Kumar on Sunday announced that his All India Samuthuva Makkal Katchi (AISMK) has decided to part ways with its long-time ally, the ruling AIADMK, on whose \u2018Two Leaves\u2019 symbol he was elected from the Tenkasi constituency in the 2011 Assembly election. Addressing a booth committee meeting of the party here, Mr. Sarath Kumar said the decision to leave the AIADMK alliance was taken as there was no respect for the hard work and unstinted support extended to the ruling party for the last nine years.\u201cThough everybody teased me as a sycophant (of Ms. Jayalalithaa) I was extending support to all decisions of the AIADMK in the past. I campaigned for the success of the party . In spite of this I was treated like curry leaves,\u201d he said.",
