    "text": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday thanked all the members of the Legislative Assembly for passing the bills increasing the percentage of reservation for women in local bodies from 33 to 50 per cent.\n\nThe hike in reservation would lead to faster development of rural and urban areas, Ms. Jayalalithaa said in a statement. The State assembly on Saturday unanimously passed the bills amending the municipal and panchayat laws to increase reservation for women. The Chief Minister said a nation\u2019s development was not just to be measured in terms of economic growth but also in terms of the progress made by women.\n\n\u201cProviding security to women and enhancing their economic capability alone does not signify independence. Women should have adequate representation in nation building. Hence, we provided 33 per cent reservation for women in local bodies in my earlier regime,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa said.\n\n\u201cBy increasing the reservation to 50 per cent, we can ensure greater participation of women, and urban and rural areas will grow faster with their participation,\u201d she said.",
