    "text": "A heart was transported from a brain dead patient in Aurangabad in Maharashtra to Chennai and transplanted on a 16-year-old boy.\n\nThe inter-state green corridor was possible after a hospital in Aurangabad called in, late Saturday, to inform the Chennai hospital about a donor who was declared brain dead, following a road accident.\n\n\u201cWe received a call at 1.30 a.m. We left Chennai at 3 a.m. and reached the hospital at 6.30 a.m. The donor was a 28-year-old man and his heart was good. We harvested the organ around 8 a.m. and reached Chennai around noon. Within 12 minutes the heart reached the hospital,\u201d said K. Suresh Rao, head of the Department of Cardiac Anaesthesia and Cardiac Critical Care at Malar Hospital, where the transplant took place.\n\nTransplant Authority of Tamil Nadu, the nodal agency that authorises sharing of organs, helped create the green corridor. At the hospital the 16-year-old recipient, a resident of Delhi who is currently in Chennai, had been prepared for the transplant surgery by cardiothoracic surgeon K.R. Balakrishnan.\n\n\u201cWithin 35 minutes the heart was transplanted and it had started beating,\u201d Dr. Rao said. The boy was shifted to the intensive care unit within an hour of the surgery and is doing well, he added.",
