    "text": "Members of Vaa Nanba, a collective of volunteers in the city, carried out a cleanup drive at the traffic island at Arasaradi junction on Sunday.\n\nThe place was filled with shrubs and junk as no maintenance activity had been carried out for a long time. Vaa Nanba volunteers said that they cleaned up the place as part of their weekly volunteering activities. About 25 volunteers swung into action on Sunday morning and made the place tidy in a couple of hours. They also planted 50 saplings on the traffic island.\n\nThey distributed pamphlets in the area to create awareness of sanitation. The group, which brings together volunteers through social media platforms, is carrying out cleanup drives, charity and saplings planting in and around the city.",
