The city and the district police book several cases every day against persons found betting and selling lottery tickets and seize cash from them. While this is against the illegal activities, online versions of these banned Acts are yet to be brought under control. Some of these sites are blocked by the agencies concerned, terming the websites as Forbidden Category for \u201cGambling\u201d.\n\nCyber Crime Police say they have not received any complaint from victims so far that they lost money in gambling or in online lottery. Police say that they might not have received any complaint as indulging in the illegal Act was an offence and would attract punishment.\n\nStating that servers of betting websites were mostly in countries such as the US where they were not banned, the cyber crime personnel said it is a complicated procedure for them to get those sites blocked or recover money from them. They advised persons to block such sites, or bring it to their attention. The cyber crime cell here is located in the city police office premises.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nM.K. Ananth)",
