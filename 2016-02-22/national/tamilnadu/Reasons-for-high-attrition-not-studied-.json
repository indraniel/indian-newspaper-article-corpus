VIMAL KUMAR\n\nLack of systematic studies to understand the reasons for the high rate of attrition in textile clusters including Tirupur, is a cause for concern, according to J. V. Rao, Chief Executive Officer of Textile Sector Skill Council.\n\n\u201cAttrition affects quality of production as well as profitability as new set of people who replace the workers moved out will take time to perform at desired levels,\u201d Mr. Rao told The Hindu.\n\nHe was here to attend a conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and NIFT-TEA Knitwear Institute on \u2018Performance enhancement towards world class manufacturing.\u2019\n\nThe textile units should conduct \u2018exit interviews\u2019 when workers move out, and evolve a tracking system to understand whether the workers who left the units were returning after some time.\n\nMr. Rao was of the opinion that it was imperative for textile businessmen to join hands for a collective growth.\u201cIndividual excellences by few units will not do help improve the image of Tirupur in the eyes of foreign buyers,\u201d he said. About 70,000 new employees needed to be inducted in spinning, weaving, knitting, and processing sectors in the country every year for the next few years.\n\n\u201cUnits should take responsibility of training them effectively,\u201d he said.\n\nCII (Tirupur district council) chairman M. Velusamy; NIFT-TEA Institute chief mentor Raja Shanmugam; and Tirupur Thozhil Pathukappu Kuzhu coordinator T.R. Vijayakumar; were among those who spoke on various techniques that needed to be adopted for improving apparel production.",
