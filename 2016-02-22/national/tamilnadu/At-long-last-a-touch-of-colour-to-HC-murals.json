Sudhakar of the Madras High Court.\n\nNorth Presidency division of Public Works Department (PWD) will coordinate with the NRLCCP in the restoration work. \u201cWe are waiting for the government\u2019s nod, which is expected soon. Once the order is passed, we will issue tenders for the work,\u201d an official at the Madras High Court told The Hindu . At present, the High Court building has a total of 24 domes of which paintings were found only on 20 domes by the expert team of the NRLCCP.\n\nThe NRLCCP will restore the existing murals. The domes were constructed using fired bricks with three layers of lime plaster. Except for the large dome, which is around 40 metres high, the domes are around 20 metres tall.\n\n\u201cSalt particles are the major reason for the damage to heritage structures,\u201d said V. Jeyaraj, former curator, Government Museum (Egmore).",
