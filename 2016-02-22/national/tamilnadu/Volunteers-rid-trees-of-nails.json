VELANKANNI RAJ\n\nA special drive to protect the trees was organised here on Sunday. Volunteers of \u2018Thanner\u2019, a service organisation, cleared the trees of nails and banners and flex-boards during a special drive. \u201cTrees located at thoroughfares or at the junction areas bear the brunt of the nails and act as a platform for advertisers to set up hoardings,\u201d says M. Sekaran, who inaugurated the \u201cclean the nails\u201d drive on the Gandhi Mandapam premises.\n\nNails of different sizes and shapes were removed. They could collect nails weighing about 3 kg. \u201cThis is the first part of the programme and we will continue it in other parts of the city,\u201d said K.C. Neelamegam, secretary of \u2018Thanner\u2019.\n\nInterestingly, most of the hoardings containing slogans \u2018plant the trees and harvest rain water\u2019 (Maram naduvom \u2013 mazhai peeruvom) had been nailed on the trees.\n\nMr. Sekaran said that nails caused more harm than good to the trees and hence the drive.",
