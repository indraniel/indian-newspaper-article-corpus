Vigneswaran, brother of Sankar.\n\nDoubts\n\nMr. Vigneswaran told The Hindu that the family was not fully convinced of the way the investigation was progressing. \u201cWe even doubt whether the five were actually arrested or they surrendered to cover up some thing,\u201d he said.\n\nCPI(M) Central Committee member U. Vasuki, too criticised the release of the picture.",
