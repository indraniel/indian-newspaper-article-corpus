The terminal, the officials said, was now placed near the station master\u2019s office so that the information was uploaded immediately.\n\nWhen passengers entered the train number, the platform number would be displayed immediately.\n\nOfficials said that they had launched the new system for trains leaving Chennai Central, but would gradually extend it to other major stations.\n\nUsers who tried the NTES app said they were able to receive details about the platform numbers of trains leaving from Egmore too.\n\nOfficials said the app would show the platform numbers of trains departing from Egmore, but it was not complete.\n\nThey said that passengers could get information about the platform numbers by sending an SMS in the following format: AD (train No.) 044 (STD code of Chennai), an official press release said.",
