Puram on Friday symbolising prayers offered for the Indian cricket team to win the ongoing T20 world cup. The executive director of ABT Limited, Coimbatore, M. Hariharasudhan lit the agarbathi in the initiative launched by Cycle Pure Agarbathies.\n\nCoimbatore is among the 50 cities across the country where the company is carrying out the campaign. From Friday, a promotion vehicle carrying a six-foot-tall agarbathi will go around the city for the next few days, urging onlookers to pray for the Indian team\u2019s victory in the tournament. The vehicle will also collect prayers from the fans, in writing.\n\nThe leading agarbathi manufacturer has launched a similar campaign for the team to emerge victorious during the ICC World Cup in 2011 and 2015.",
