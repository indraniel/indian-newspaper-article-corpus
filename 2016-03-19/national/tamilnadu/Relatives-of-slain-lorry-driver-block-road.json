According to sources, the men had beaten up Rajesh, and when Subramani attempted to intervene, he was shot dead. Rajesh had managed to reach for help, after the gang scooted.\n\nThe men had plied a load for a Tiruchengode-based lorry firm to Pantnagar in Madhya Pradesh, and were returning with a load of groundnut to Chennai, when the crime happened. Rajesh had managed to call up the relatives of Subramani. The body that was expected to arrive here by evening was delayed after officials in Pantnagar had stalled paperwork for want of date of birth of the victim.\n\nThe agitated relatives took to Tirupathur - Dharmapuri main road and refused to move till the administration intervened. Revenue officials and police arrived to assuage the protesters and assured them that the body would arrive at Bengaluru by Friday night. On the other hand, the Tamil Nadu Lorry Operators Federation has called for some form of security for lorry drivers from the State.",
