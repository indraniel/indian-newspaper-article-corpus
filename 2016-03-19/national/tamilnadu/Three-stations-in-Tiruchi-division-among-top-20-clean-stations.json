This was done face-to-face by survey teams by visiting each of the 407 stations across 16 zonal railways.\n\nEvery passenger was asked to rate the cleanliness of stations objectively on 40 different cleanliness parameters.\n\nBased on passenger feedback and analysis thereof, the 407 stations were given rankings in the preliminary report submitted by the survey agency through IRCTC to the Ministry of Railways for scrutiny and action, according to a Southern Railway release.\n\nAccording to the report, Kumbakonam comes fifth in the cleanliness ranking order among the top 20 \u2018A\u2019 category stations in the country.\n\nTiruchi and Thanjavur are ranked 12{+t}{+h}and 19{+t}{+h}respectively.\n\nKovilpatti, Virudhunagar, Erode, Salem, and Mettupalayam are the other stations in the Southern Railway zone to have been adjudged cleanest among the top 20 stations falling under the \u2018A\u2019 category.",
