    "text": "Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani on Friday said the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam\u2019s decision not to align with the DMK-led front was certainly not a loss to that alliance.\n\nClaiming that the DMK-Congress tie up was based on ideology, Mr. Veeramani said the front was a strong one to challenge the ruling AIADMK in the forthcoming Assembly poll.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here, Mr. Veeramani claimed that the prospects of the DMK-led front emerging victorious in the upcoming poll was bright despite a multi-cornered contest on the cards.\n\nThe State today required a just, stable and pro-people government, he said adding that there should be transformation of power rather than transfer of power.\n\nMr. Veeramani said the Dravidar Kazhagam\u2019s conference at Tiruchi on March 19 and 20 would focus on social justice and eradication of caste and untouchability.\n\nDMK treasurer M.K. Stalin, TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan, retired judges, Tamil intellectuals and others would take part in the conference, Mr. Veeramani said.",
