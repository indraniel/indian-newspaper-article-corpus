    "text": "The Federation of All Trade and Industries Association (FATIA) has expressed concern over lack of political will in the State for implementation of Coimbatore-Salem Industrial Corridor project.\n\nStudy\n\nThe State Government had announced during the same time in 2013 that the technical study for the industrial corridor project had been completed. The Industries Ministry had also informed then that a land bank with thousands of acres of land would be created. However, there is no sign of any land being acquired for the project along the National Highway, though the project envisages investment of over Rs. 14,500 crore in infrastructure through public-private partnership, said N. Sivanesan, FATIA president.\n\nThe project, according to FATIA, must be pursued in right earnest since it would attract industrial investments of Rs. 40,000 crore resulting in creation of over 11 lakh jobs.\n\nAgricultural processing, tourism, textile sector, and knowledge processing domains will witness a surge if the project takes shape, industry associations assure.",
