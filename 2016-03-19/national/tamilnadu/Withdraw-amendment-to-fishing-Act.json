    "text": "Country boat fishermen say it will destroy their livelihood\n\nFishermen from the coastal villages of the district have urged the State government to withdraw the latest amendment it made to the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983, \u201cas it will destroy the livelihood of country boat fishermen\u201d.\n\nIn a petition submitted at the Collector\u2019s office here on Friday, a group of fishermen from a few coastal hamlets in the district said that the country boat fishermen, who were using rows till three decades ago, had fitted outboard engines with capacity ranging from 8 HP to 40 HP in their boats.\n\nThese kerosene-powered engines were being used only for manoeuvring the boats from the coast to the fishing spots in the sea and not for trolling purposes, for which these engines of lower capacity could not be used.\n\nMoreover, the country boat fishermen could not carry out deep sea fishing owing to the smaller size of the craft and lesser capacity of engines.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983 was made in the Assembly on February 20, 2016 which prohibited fishing operations by the country boats fitted with engines with a capacity of more than 8 HP within three nautical miles from the shore. Violators would attract a fine of Rs. 50,000, the amendment said.\n\n\u201cThe outboard engines fitted in the country boats are not at all used for harvesting fishes as being done by mechanised boats and trawlers. The country boat fishermen are doing the work manually. Hence, this amendment, which will wipe out the livelihood of the country boat fishermen, should be withdrawn,\u201d said S.V. Antony of Uvari, one of the signatories to the petition.\n\nHe also said that the mechanised boats from Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari districts, which were carrying out fishing operations even within three nautical miles from the shores of Tirunelveli district, had almost decimated the livelihood of over 5,000 country boat fishermen here.",
