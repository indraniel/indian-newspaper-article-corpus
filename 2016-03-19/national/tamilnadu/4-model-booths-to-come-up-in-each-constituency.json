We are in the process\u201d.\n\nAll the polling booths will have ramps for differently-abled and we are preparing to arrange tricycles for each booth. We would also be recruiting volunteers to operate the tricycle, he said.\n\nMallavadi Rehabilitation Centre for Leprosy patients would have an exclusive booth for the 200 odd inmates and the doctors taking care of them would be polling officers, he added. Each of the eight assembly constituencies would have three static surveillance teams and three flying squads with vehicles.",
