    "text": "nforcement measures and safety awareness campaigns notwithstanding, rule violations of different types continue right under the nose of the police in the city.\n\nOverloading of autorickshaws carrying schoolchildren continues unabated in the city.\n\nDespite a government directive issued a few years ago clearly stating the number of children to be taken in such three-wheelers, many drivers have been flagrantly violating the order with impunity.\n\nAutorickshaws packed with students beyond permitted capacity with their school and lunch bags dangling on the hooks fitted at the side of the vehicles is common on different stretches in the city.\n\nAs per the government order issued a few years ago, a maximum of only five children up to the age of 14 can be accommodated in the autorickshaw.\n\nThis rule is followed more in the breach. Many auto drivers have take many children with one or two of them even riding as co-driver with their limbs projecting out posing a great danger to the innocent students and other vehicle users. Although safety-related awareness campaigns and enforcement drives were organised on the one hand, such violation continues unabated. Transport Department officials say they have been enforcing the rule by imposing fines on the erring drivers. Nevertheless, the violation continues despite imposition of fines.\n\nParents have a role here and they should desist from sending their wards in an overloaded auto keeping in mind the safety of their children, says a consumer activist.\n\nThe police officials should be made accountable and liable for the violation which would go a long way in checking overloading, says the activist.",
