    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Cable TV Service Providers Association met the Chief Electoral Officer and petitioned the State Election Commission to prevent political parties from announcing provision of free set-top boxes in their electoral manifesto.\n\nThe association\u2019s president S.P.K. Gokul Doss and other office-bearers met state CEO, Rajesh Lakhoni and handed over a petition on Friday evening.\n\nThe association moved the commission after a report in a Tamil daily purportedly published an article suggesting that a political party was planning to announce free set-top boxes to cable TV subscribers if the party came to power. \u201cWhy are cable operators always in the firing line of political parties? We have petitioned the Election Commission against this purported announcement by the party. We have asked the commission to ban any such announcement either in the manifesto or by any other indirect means,\u201d Mr. Gokul Doss told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Doss said the announcement, if made, would be illegal. \u201cTamil Nadu is the only State where the Digital Addressable System (DAS) has not been implemented. Any announcement of providing free set boxes or related items will be illegal as the case is pending in the Madras High Court and various other courts,\u201d the petition said.\n\nCable TV service providers cite report suggesting that a party may make the announcement",
