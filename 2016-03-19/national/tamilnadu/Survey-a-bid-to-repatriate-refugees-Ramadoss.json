    "text": "Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S. Ramadoss has alleged that an attempt was being made to repatriate Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Tamil Nadu by creating an opinion that they were willing to return home.\n\nReferring to a survey being conducted among refugees by an NGO that is circulating a three-page questionnaire seeking to know their personal details and future plans, Dr. Ramadoss said the motive was to float an impression that the refugees were longing to return to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe survey would not have been possible without the support of the Union and State governments, he said.\n\nPointing out that the special rehabilitation package for refugees promised by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2011 was not implemented, the PMK leader said the survey had infused a sense of fear in the minds of the refugees.\n\nFacilitate work permit\n\nHe sought the immediate intervention of the State government to stop the ongoing survey. The government should enact a law to facilitate work permit to refugees.",
