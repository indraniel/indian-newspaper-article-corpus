    "text": "The Salem District Consumer Redressal Forum on Thursday ordered a real estate owner to repay the advance amount paid by a consumer with interest for failing to allot housing plots.\n\nV. Nareshkumar of Kondappanaickenpatti approached a private plot developer on Cherry Road seeking two plots. The managing director assured him to give two plots, numbers 32 and 43, for Rs. 3.48 lakh for which Nareshkumar paid Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 20,000 as advance in two instalments in 2013. The realtor promised to give 1,000 and 660 sq.ft. land in Minnampalli and complete the registration in 11 months.\n\nOn March 20, 2014, Nareshkumar approached the company with the balance money seeking registering of plots in his name. But, the company sold the plots to a customer and allotted him two plots in the foothills of a hillock. Nareshkumar demanded refund of his money with interest. His efforts to get the money failed and hence, he approached S. Selvam, chairman of Tamil Nadu Consumer and Public Rights Vigilance Committee. Despite notice served on the company, it failed to repay the money.\n\nA case was filed in the consumer forum on July 27, 2015 seeking repayment of Rs. 22,000 at 18 per cent interest along with compensation for causing hardship. Consumer court judge R. Ganesan and member S. Rajeswari found service discrepancy in failing to allot the promised plot. Hence, they ordered the company to pay Rs. 22,000 along with 7.5 per cent interest, calculated from April 29, 2013, the day he paid the advance to the company. Also, the judge ordered a compensation of Rs. 2,000 and expenses towards the case of Rs. 1,000 to be paid to Nareshkumar. They ordered the company to settle the amount in two months.",
