Kaul said, \u201cWe are amazed at the lack of sensitivity and foresight of the Ministry in seeking such modification. In nutshell, what is sought to be suggested is that the concession is applicable only to a certain type of disabled persons who cannot travel alone.\u201d\n\nWhat is sought to be canvassed is that if a physically challenged person is travelling on his own without an escort, the benefit of concession stands withdrawn, even though the person is covered under the provisions of the Act, the Bench added.\n\nNoting that this is bordering on absurdity, the Bench said, \u201cWe are unequivocally of the view that the application is misconceived, contrary to the intent and purpose of the said Act and a mindless exercise. We dismiss this application with cost of Rs. 10,000 payable to EKTHA in Kotturpuram, run by the petitioner within 15 days.\u201d\n\nThe Bench then directed the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities to verify the position on the compliance of the order and file a report by April 27.",
