    "text": "The Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owners Federation has suggested that the State government engage in direct sale of sand to control escalating prices.\n\nSuch a move would also lead to greater revenue generation for the government, the federation said at a recent press briefing.\n\nFederation president S. Yuvaraj said that a revenue to the tune of nearly Rs.25,000 crore could be earned every year if the government took up direct sales instead of going through stockyard dealers.\n\n\u201cWe will chalk out plans at a conference that would be held in the city on April 4. A separate department must be formed for sand-mining,\u201d he said.\n\nS. Thirunavukarasu, former Public Works Department engineer, said several waterways had silted up and sand-mining could be allowed to increase their carrying capacity.\n\nMembers of the federation noted that though the PWD had set the price of two units of sand, comprising 200 cubic ft, at Rs. 840, they procured it for Rs. 4,000 from the stockyard.\n\nWhen the truckload of three units of sand reached consumers, they had to pay Rs.11,500.\n\nComputerised\n\nbilling system\n\nThey said that of the 25,000 loads of sand being transported across the State, nearly 6,000 truckloads were brought to Chennai. Besides direct sales, the government must switch to computerised billing system as in Telangana.\n\nThe other demands, include a ban on overloading of vehicles and decreasing toll rates, would also be discussed at the upcoming conference, they added.",
