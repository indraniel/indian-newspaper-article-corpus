The notification, sources said, was a fake.\n\nReacting to this, the Ministry issued a caution notice, stating that neither the RPF nor any other department of the Ministry was conducting any such pre-recruitment camp.\n\nIt appealed to the youth to be on the guard against such bogus organisations.\n\nFurther, it said the youth should check the official websites of Railway Recruitment Board (www.rrbchennai.gov.in) and Railway Recruitment Cell (www.rrcmas.in) for job notifications, recruitment processes and results.\n\nAnnouncement comes after a fake notice calling for the post of RPF women constables started doing rounds",
