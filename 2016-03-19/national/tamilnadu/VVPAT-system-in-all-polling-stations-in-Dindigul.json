Hariharan.\n\nInspecting the functioning of the unit at the Collectorate here on Friday, he said that this facility would be available in all the 272 polling stations meant for Dindigul Assembly Constituency. A total of 335 units had been received for display. Testing of the equipment was on, he added.\n\nThe voter will be able to see a printout of the symbol of the candidate, for whom he has voted. The printout of the image could be viewed through a glass window in the VVPAT unit. Moreover, the print out will be displayed on the screen for seven seconds for the voter to see.\n\nLater, the print out will automatically fall in to a collection box fitted along with the unit. The unit has the capacity to print 2,000 receipts where as the maximum number of voters in each polling station was only 1,200. The print roll fixed in each unit will suffice to provide print out to all voters.\n\nThe VVPAT units had been procured from the Bharat Electronics Limited, Bangalore. Training would be given to polling staff to handle the VVPAT system shortly, he added.",
