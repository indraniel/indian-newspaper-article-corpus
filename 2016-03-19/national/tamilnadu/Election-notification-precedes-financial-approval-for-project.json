    "text": "The public will have to put up with the chaotic traffic conditions in the city, particularly along Mettur and Brough Roads until the next government is in place in the State.\n\nImplementation of the flyover project at GH Junction that is vital for easing traffic congestion along the two arterial roads will be delayed in all likelihood since the financial sanction for the works was not made before the election notification, sources said.\n\nThe situation turns chaotic along the stretch of Mettur Road between GH Junction and the Bus Stand during peak hours, and the traffic police despite doing their best to prevent parking of vehicles on two sides, have not been able to prevent congestion.\n\nThe administrative sanction of Rs. 22.92 crore for the road over-bridge accorded by the State Government at the start of 2014 was meant to be utilised for land acquisition, replacement of power lines and telephone poles, and altering the alignment of the underground drainage\n\nThe over-bridge in a cross formation was envisaged to run to a length of 200 metres each on the sides of Perundurai and Brough roads and 100 metres on the sides of Mettur Road and EVN Road.\n\nThe design for the construction part of the flyover project was readied with a proposal for Rs. 75 crore expenditure by the Highways Department.\n\nWhile the design has been approved, the election notification came when the financial sanction was about to be made, sources said.",
