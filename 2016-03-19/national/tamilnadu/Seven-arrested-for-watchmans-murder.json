Kiran Kumar (26) of Thiruvottriyur, Chennai, who upon interrogation revealed his participation in the attempted burglary of a jewellery shop at Kasukadai Street here early on Thursday in which a watchman Govindaraj (60) was killed. Interrogation revealed that his accomplices were staying with Ramesh and Mohan on the Nanjikkottai Road. A police team rounded up K. Syed (26) of Seppanavari, Thanjavur, Karthi (22), Mohan (35), Ramesh (26) of Thanjavur, another Ramesh (31) of Chennai, and Kutty alias Mohan (27) who were allegedly involved in the crime.\n\nSources said that Govindaraj of Umayal Arkadu village was employed as a night watchman three months ago by a group of jewellers in the Kasukadai Street. In the early hours of Thursday, the culprits tried to break open the shutters of a jewellery shop when Govindaraj tried to prevent them. The assailants attacked him on the head and he dropped dead and the culprits dumped his body in a storm-water drain and carried on with their work on opening the shutters of a shop. Just then a police patrol team arrived on the spot. The gang fled but sustained pursuit by the alert police led to the arrest of Kiran Kumar and then the whole gang. Incidentally, Karthi was appearing for the Plus Two exams as a private candidate. Having appeared in three papers, Karthi got enmeshed in the crime and has been caught. Further investigations were under way.",
