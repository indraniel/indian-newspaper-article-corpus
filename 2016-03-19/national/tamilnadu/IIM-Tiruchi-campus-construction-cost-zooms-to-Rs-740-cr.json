    "text": "Construction under way on the 175-acre site at Chinna Suriyur village\n\nThe estimate for the construction of new campus of the Indian Institute of Management-Tiruchi is likely to go up to Rs. 740 crore because of cost escalation.\n\nAs per the original plan, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) had sanctioned about Rs. 333 crore for constructing own campus for the IIM-T, which is functioning in a portion of the National Institute of Technology-Tiruchi. Construction is under way on 175 acres of land at Chinna Suriyur on Tiruchi-Pudukottai Road.\n\nConstruction of academic block, administrative block, and faculty residential quarters had almost been completed. The work of interior and other final touches were done now. The IIM had planned to move to the new campus in June or July. Although the IIM-T authorities have expressed confidence on moving to the new campus as scheduled, they said the construction activities had been restricted to 78,000 square metres as against the 1.15 lakh square metres because of cost escalation.\n\nAuthorities said the estimate for the current plan was arrived at based on the cost price of 2007. Since the cost price had seen a dramatic increase, it had been felt that it was not possible to complete all work with the current estimate of Rs. 333 crore. It was said that the Ministry of Human Resource Development had prepared a revised estimate by taking into account of the 2016 cost. The IIM-T had forwarded its suggestions and requirements. The sources added that the revised estimate was likely to go up to Rs. 740 crore from Rs. 333 crore to provide all world class amenities. Once the revised plan was approved, construction of auditorium, additional hostels, and other buildings would be started.",
