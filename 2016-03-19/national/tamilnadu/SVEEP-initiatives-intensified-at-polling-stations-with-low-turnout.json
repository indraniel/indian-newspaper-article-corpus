Hariharan said that special attention was given to these areas. Voter turnout in this area was around 60 per cent in the last Lok Sabha poll. Banners would be erected near the polling stations with low turnout. Officials would distribute awareness pamphlets and stick stickers on vehicles to improve the turnout in this election. They would also undertake door-to-door and street campaign, he added.\n\nLater, the Collector inspected vehicle check carried out by special squad at Dindigul-Tiruchi highway. He also inspected a model polling station at Government Boys Higher Secondary School at Vadamadurai. Four model polling stations would be set up in each constituency. They would be equipped with all facilities such as ramps for differently abled voters, drinking water facility, washrooms and electricity.\n\nAn observer, exclusively to monitor SVEEP initiatives was appointed for Theni and Dindigul districts. He was expected to visit Dindigul district shortly to asses SVEEP initiatives.",
