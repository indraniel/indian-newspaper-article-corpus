What if it had been severe?\u201d she asked pointing out to the big crack near her door that had been caused by the impact of the collapse.\n\nThree houses had been constructed on the bridge; luckily, as residents put it, the owner of the house at the farthest end was away.\n\n\u201cWe have told them several times not to live there, as it is an old bridge. We have also asked them to move to a better place, but they are reluctant,\u201d said a Greater Chennai Corporation official who had come for inspection.\n\nResidents, however, say they will move only if they are provided with an alternative place to which they can relocate.\n\nThey further claim that they are still waiting for an alternative housing facility, which officials had promised them last year.\n\nMany residents have now temporarily moved out to the streets to avoid any mishap.",
