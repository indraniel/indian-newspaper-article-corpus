In a representation to the ECI, M. Sekaran, president of the federation, said about 140 not-for-profit consumer organisations have been recognised by the Department of Consumer Affairs of the Tamil Nadu Government in the State and the services of members of these organisations could be used to ensure a free and fair election in the State.\n\n\u2018Deposit firearms\u2019\n\nAll licensed firearm holders should deposit their weapons at the nearest police stations immediately in view of the election, Collector K.S. Palanisamy said in a release. Of the 1,007 weapons in use in the district, only 720 have been deposited with the police. The remaining weapons should be deposited within one or two days, he said. Action would be initiated against those holding the weapons in violation of the election rules, he added.\n\nPermission for\n\nannadhanam\n\nAll persons who organise annadhanams in view of the poochorithal festival of the Arulmigu Mariamman Temple, Samayapuram, should obtain permission from the Food Safety officials, Collector K.S. Palanisamy has said. The organisers should ensure proper hygiene at the place where the food is cooked. Only permitted colouring agents and preservatives should be used. Food and drinking water should not be distributed in plastic sachets. Hotels should also ensure quality of food made available to devotees. Complaints, if any on distribution of sub-standard food, can be made with C.Suresh Babu, Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration, by dialling 0431-2333330 or 9965461230.",
