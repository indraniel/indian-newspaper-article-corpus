    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Saturday said while he was against capital punishment, it was the government\u2019s responsibility to dispel the opinion that the law was not bent in favour of the ruling partymen in the bus burning incident in which three girls were killed.\n\nReacting to Friday\u2019s Supreme Court order commuting to life sentence the death penalty awarded to three AIADMK men, Mr. Karunanidhi said the case had been unnecessarily dragged during the AIADMK rule and was indicted by the Madras High Court for the delay.\n\nHe said the parents of the three girls should get solace and peace.\n\n\u201cA judgment should give the impression that it rendered justice. Whether such an impression has been created in this case is left to those who go through the judgment,\u201d he said.",
