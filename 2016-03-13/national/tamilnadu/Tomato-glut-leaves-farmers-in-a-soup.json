SRINATH\n\nTomato prices have plummeted to a new low in the open market in Tiruchi because of heavy arrivals.\n\nOne kg of top quality tomato was sold at Rs. 6 at Gandhi Market in Tiruchi on Saturday.\n\nThe price was quoted at Rs. 4 on Friday.\n\nThe tomatoes, which are small in size and marginally damaged in transit, were sold at Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 a kg.\n\nThe same rate was prevailing in Uzhavar Sandhai, where farmers, some of them growers, had brought their produce for sales on Saturday.\n\nSimilarly, one kg of tomato was sold at Rs. 5 in the farm fresh outlets, which are run in different places in Tiruchi by the Department of Cooperative Societies.\n\nHowever, the price was Rs. 8 to Rs. 12 a kg at grocery shops. The traders, who had received heavy arrivals for the last few days, have been finding it difficult to clear the stock.\n\nThere were reports that the traders dumped the unsold tomatoes that had begun to rot.\n\n\u201cIt is a delight to buy tomato as it is so cheap. I usually buy two kg per week. However, I have bought three kg this time,\u201d said M. Murugan of Thennur, who came to Uzhavar Sandhai at Thennur.\n\nTraders said the arrival had doubled over the last few days. They had been getting loads from all centres in Dindigul, Theni, Oddanchathiram, and so on, where farmers had reportedly seen bumper harvest.\n\nThe prices had plummeted due to excess arrival than the actual demand. They said the current rate would continue for a few more weeks.\n\nCOOLING PRICES\n\nFarm fresh outlets selling tomatoes at Rs. 5 a kg\n\nTraders say the situation may continue for a few more days",
