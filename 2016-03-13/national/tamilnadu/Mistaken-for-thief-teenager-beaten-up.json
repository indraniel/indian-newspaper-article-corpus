Commissioner of Police T.K.Rajendran has tasked his team to provide a detailed report on the issue in a day\u2019s time.\n\nThe teenager, Ganesh (name changed), is the third son of Vincent, a daily wage earner and Sumathi, residing in Kannagi Nagar. After his VII standard, Ganesh dropped out of school and started assisting his father at Pudupet.\n\n\u201cOn Friday night, when he was about to have dinner, a few persons claiming to be policemen came to the house and dragged him away. They took him in a jeep,\u201d said Mr. Vincent told The Hindu.\n\nMr. Vincent was asked to come to the Mylapore police station. \u201cWe went there and found he was not there. Then, we went to other police stations, but could not find him. Around 1 a.m on Saturday, my eldest son called me and said Ganesh had returned home,\u201d added Sumathi.\n\nMr. Vincent found Ganesh badly injured and could not speak properly. He had injuries on his lips and torso and was unable to eat.\n\n\u201cGanesh, after undergoing treatment, told us that the policemen blindfolded him and beat him up. Based on a conversation between the policemen, he suspected that he was near the Velachery railway station. He also heard them say that they picked up the wrong person on charges of stealing cell phones and dropped him near the Thoraipakkam signal,\u201d alleged Vincent.\n\nThe police claim there are cases of theft against the teenager.\n\nKannagi Nagar resident lodges complaint with Chennai police",
