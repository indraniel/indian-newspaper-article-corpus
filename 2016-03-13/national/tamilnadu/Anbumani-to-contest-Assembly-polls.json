    "text": "PMK chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss on Saturday said that he would contest the Assembly elections.\n\n\u201cBeing the Chief Ministerial candidate of the party, I will positively contest in the Assembly elections. The party will finalise the constituency. The party candidates list will also be released shortly,\u201d he told reporters in Salem.\n\nThe PMK was preparing a list of officials who were favourably disposed towards the ruling AIADMK and will present a memorandum to the Chief Electoral Officer seeking their transfer.\n\nTransfer of officials\n\nThe State government in a haphazard manner transferred many officers across the state prior to the announcement of the poll schedule without adopting proper procedures. The officers who were favouring the ruling party were transferred to vital postings connected to the elections, he charged.\n\n\u201cIf need arises, I myself will meet the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi and draw his attention to this issue\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier in Coimbatore, he alleged that the ruling AIADMK was planning to distribute smart phones to over one crore young voters. The PMK would lodge a complaint with the Election Commission.\n\nHuge debt\n\nHe said the DMK and AIADMK governments had mismanaged the State accumulating debts over the years. The State\u2019s debt was Rs. 1.05 lakh crore when Chief Minister Jayalalithaa assumed office in 2011. Now, at the end of her tenure, the debt stood at Rs. 2.50 lakh crore.",
