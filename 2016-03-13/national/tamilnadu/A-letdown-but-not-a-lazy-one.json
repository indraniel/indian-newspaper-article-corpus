    "text": "Any film with the word \u201c kadhal \u201d in the title is usually served in one of three flavours \u2014 a general romance; its cutesy variant, the rom-com; or what might be called the rom-trag, where boy and girl jump off a cliff, or are hacked to pieces or . Nalan Kumarasamy\u2019s Kadhalum Kadanthu Pogum is (d) none of the above.\n\nThe story gets going when Yazhini (Madonna Sebastian) loses her IT job in the recession. She has to give up the posh high-rise apartment she shared with roomies and move into a matchbox of a flat, past a low entrance that bears the warning: Kunindhu sellavum . It\u2019s a constant reminder of just how much she\u2019s come down in life. Another reminder lives in the opposite flat, a rowdy named Kathir (Vijay Sethupathi). A less adventurous film would chart their unlikely love story\u2014 opposites attract, et cetera. Kadhalum\u2026 , though, invites us to ponder this question: What kind of relationship can there be between a girl who reads A Brief History of Time and a guy who\u2019s just been released from jail? This is, in many ways, an anti-romance. It\u2019s no accident that the film Yazhini and Kathir end up watching on TV is... Kadhalikka Neramillai . Who has time for love?\n\nThere are other things to think about. Yazhini needs a job right now, but she also harbours a vague ambition that she cannot put into precise words. Kathir says that\u2019s okay. Goals should not be easily understood. The film is filled with these lovely little non-dialoguey half-thoughts, which crop up when real people converse. Kathir has a goal too. He wants to own a bar. And till that happens, till he gets rich, he\u2019s got to watch what he spends. Note the scene where he pays for Yazhini\u2019s breakfast and later asks her to pay him back. It isn\u2019t just a funny moment about a man who wanted to show off in front of the hotel manager. It also showcases his desperation.\n\nKadhalum\u2026 , then, is about two ships\u2014 or maybe we should say catamarans\u2014 passing in the night, on a stormy sea. And we get an answer to what kind of relationship could exist between them. Kathir and Yazhini become each other\u2019s support system, a kind of lifeline \u2014 for they seem to have no one else to turn to.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of nice filmmaking here\u2014though how much is from the South Korean original, My Dear Desperado , I do not know. Yazhini\u2019s entire arc with her ex is so delicately handled, we barely notice it. But apart from a handful of scenes, I wasn\u2019t particularly drawn to anything or anyone. I felt nothing for Yazhini when she was humiliated by a couple of interviewers. Kadhalum\u2026 takes a very long time to find its rhythms, and the first half, especially, just sits there, animated solely by Santhosh Narayanan\u2019s score. The composer may be getting too tied down to a sound \u2014 lush, quirky, local \u2014 but at least it throbs with life.\n\nThe casting doesn\u2019t help. As much as I appreciate Vijay Sethupathi seeking out varied roles and using his star power to lure audiences to films they may not see otherwise, his I-can\u2019t-be-bothered persona doesn\u2019t let us into Kathir\u2019s head at all. Madonna Sebastian is a nice presence, but she looks too vacuously model-pretty.\n\nAs second films go, Kadhalum\u2026 has to count as a letdown, but give Nalan Kumarasamy this much\u2014he hasn\u2019t made Soodhu Kavvum II , and he hasn\u2019t gone commercial with a vengeance either.\n\nHe isn\u2019t just reshaping the Kollywood romance here. He\u2019s also reshaping the sarakku scene, by having the hero get drunk with the heroine, instead of a male friend. Hearing the song \u201cOru oorula orey oru veeran\u201d over Kathir striding into a bar to bash up some goons, we expect macho fireworks, a fight scene worthy of that song, worthy of a hero. But Kathir gets beaten up instead.\n\nWalking out, I wondered if this angle wouldn\u2019t have made for an interesting movie on its own, without the crutch of the South Korean romance. But I have to admit that the Kathir-Yazhini scenes accrue weight towards the closing portions, so much so that we find ourselves completing their stories in our heads during the drive home.\n\nJust as the film comes to an end, we feel it\u2019s beginning.\n\nbaradwaj rangan\n\nKadhalum Kadanthu Pogum\n\nGenre:Romance\n\nDirector: Nalan Kumarasamy\n\nCast: Vijay Sethupathi, Madonna Sebastian\n\nStoryline:The story of two people, who are poles apart, sharing a peculiar relationship",
