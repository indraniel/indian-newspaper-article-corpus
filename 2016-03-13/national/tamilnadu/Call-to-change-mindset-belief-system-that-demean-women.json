Kumar\n\nBashir Ahmad Khan, former vice-chancellor of Sido Kanhu Murmu University, Jharkhand, called for change in mindset and the flawed belief system in our society that demeans women.\n\nHe spoke during a panel discussion on \u2018Men for Women \u2013 Understanding Gender, Equality\u2019 on Saturday organised by the Indian Women Network, an initiative of Confederation of Indian Industry.\n\nDiffering with organisers for having a panel discussion on Men for Women, he stated it should have been the other way round. He said that it was important to understand gender equality. But, talking about family-oriented values is not enough. \u201cWe are still grappling with old ideas. There is a need to change in mindset and the belief systems that perpetuate gender equality,\u201d he said. The IWN had organised the panel discussion to observe Women\u2019s Day on Saturday. They had invited men to talk about women in their lives. Mr. Khan spoke how gender roles have been deeply ingrained in our mindset that even his wife Anisa Basheer Khan, vice chancellor (i/c), Pondicherry Central University, continues to manage domestic chores and her profession. \u201cI am not going to talk about my role for success of my wife. It is the other way round,\u201d he said.\n\nP. Rangaraj, chairman and MD, Chemin C&I Private Limited, spoke about his daughter-in-law Radhiga Ragu\u2019s contribution and her role in strengthening the company.\n\nIt was 17-year-old Chirag Shah\u2019s talk that left many in the audience moist-eyed. Son of Chitra Shah, director, Satya Special School, Chirag detailed his mother\u2019s achievement and humility. He said: \u201cHow can a son not tell the world that she is the best,\u201d he said.\n\nAnanda Balayogi Bhavanani, deputy director, Centre for Yoga Therapy, Education and Research, said that life of both men and women should be cherished.
