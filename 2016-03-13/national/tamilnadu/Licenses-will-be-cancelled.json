Siva Saravanan\n\nAfter a long time, the police on Saturday started cracking the whip against those riding two-wheelers without wearing helmets.\n\nThe police told them that Regional Transport Offices would be approached to cancel the licence of those who flouted the helmet rule.\n\nThe police said that around 700 cases were registered against rule violators. As the news about police action spread like wildfire, more vehicle users were seen wearing helmets.\n\n\u201cPurpose of the drive was to make more two-wheeler riders wear helmets,\u201d said Deputy Commissioner of Police (DC) for traffic R. Sivakumar said and added that no such recommendation was given on Saturday.\n\nHe added that the police can recommend regional transport officials to initiate action against repeat violators.\n\n\u201cWe have details of the violators. If they are found repeating the offence we will recommend cancelling the license,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have registered more than 1,500 cases against helmet rule violators in the last three days,\u201d Mr. Sivakumar said. The police said that the drive would continue.",
