    "text": "With the DMDK deciding to go it alone in the upcoming Assembly elections, the seat-sharing equation between the DMK and the Congress may see an interesting turn.\n\nWhile the national party feels that the absence of any other major ally opens space for allotment of more seats in the front, the DMK is unlikely to budge and may keep its offer at minimum.\n\nA senior Congress leader, on condition of anonymity, said with the DMDK saying no to the DMK, the national party has become the only major partner in the front. The prospects of more partners joining the DMK front look slim at the moment.\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the alliance last month, we were expecting between 35 and 40 seats. But, now that the DMDK won\u2019t be with us, we believe we should be given more,\u201d said the leader. The Congress is looking for anywhere near 50 seats. \u201cThe DMK will still have more than 180 seats to contest in this equation. In 2011, we got 63 constituencies,\u201d the leader added.\n\nHowever, the DMK camp does not seem convinced with this argument. A top leader said the Congress faced a vertical split with the exit of G.K. Vasan and cannot claim the strength it had in 2011.\n\nSecondly, the leader said, in a fight between the AIADMK and the Congress, the former certainly has an upper hand since the latter's organisation strength is at its historic low in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\u201cIf we give them 63 seats like last time, we will land up losing a chunk of seats. This election is too tight to take that risk. We want a straight battle with the AIADMK in as many seats as possible. This alone will strengthen our chances,\u201d the leader added.\n\nHowever, DMK is unlikely to oblige and may keep its offer at minimum",
