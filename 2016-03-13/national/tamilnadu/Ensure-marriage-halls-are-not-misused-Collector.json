    "text": "The marriage hall owners should ensure that the marriage and community halls are not misused by political parties and candidates for distribution of money and gifts during the Assembly election campaign period, said District Collector V. Sampath.\n\nThere was every chance of the marriage halls being misused for the illegal activities to lure voters and the hall owners should not allow the same, the Collector said while addressing a meeting of the owners of the marriage hall, jewellery shops, cinema halls, and printing presses here on Friday. He said that some parties may try to take the marriage hall for rent in the guise of annadhanam. The hall owners should properly verify the invitations of the functions for which the halls were booked. There was a chance of political parties distributing gifts by issuing tokens through the pawn brokers. This too should not be entertained.\n\nAll the printing presses should ensure that election pamphlets for which orders were placed by the political parties and candidates should have their names promptly. The cinema hall personnel should inform about the details of the publicity materials shown in the middle of the shows, he said.\n\nAt another meeting of the poll officials of all the eleven Assembly constituencies in the district, Mr. Sampath sought the cooperation of the officials in conducting cent per cent free and fair polls in the district. He directed the officials to remove the flag masts of political parties from public places in the Corporation, municipal, town panchayat and panchayat limits immediately.",
