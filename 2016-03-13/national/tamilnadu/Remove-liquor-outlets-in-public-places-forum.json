Sengole Mary, district unit, and took a pledge to assert their rights in governance.\n\nFederation office-bearers Prema, N. Ramalakshmi, A Rejina Mary and district councillor A Ravichandra Ramavanni were present at the function.\n\nDistrict Election Officer and Collector S. Natarajan flagged off the rally, which also served the purpose of creating election awareness. Around 2,000 women from eight panchayat unions participated in the rally, holding placards on election awareness and urging voters to take part in the democratic process.",
