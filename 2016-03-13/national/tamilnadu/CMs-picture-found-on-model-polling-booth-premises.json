Dakshinamoorthy visited the booth located on the school premises. He found the picture of Chief Minister painted on the wall that was not covered after the model code of conduct was enforced. He immediately asked the Village Administrative Officer to cover the picture and workers erased it. Later, the Collector inspected the facilities including availability of drinking water, toilets and facilities for senior citizens. Also, the availability of ramp facility in the model booth was also inspected.\n\nAddressing reporters, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said four model booths would be established in each constituency and all the six constituencies in the district would have a total of 24 model booths. Also, one all-women polling station that would have women police personnel, women party polling agents and a woman presiding officer would be established in each of the six constituencies.",
