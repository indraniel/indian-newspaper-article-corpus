    "text": "An AIADMK councillor of Karur Municipality was allegedly attacked by a group of DMK men on Saturday.\n\nSources said there was an altercation between Chandru, 15{+t}{+h}ward councillor, and the DMK party men over laying of road on Alamaratheru.\n\nMr. Chandru had reportedly objected to them taking photographs of roadwork as he suspected that they were to be used as an evidence in the complaint with the election authorities on the charge of violating code of conduct.\n\nMr. Chandru told them that the roadwork was approved by the Karur Municipality even before the announcement of State elections. In the melee, the DMK members attacked him.\n\nHowever, Kamaraj, former DMK MLA who was passing by in his car, rescued Chandru from the DMK workers. He had been admitted to a hospital. Acting on a complaint, the Karur town police have registered a case.",
