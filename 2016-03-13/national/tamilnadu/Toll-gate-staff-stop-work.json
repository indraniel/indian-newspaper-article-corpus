    "text": "Employees of the toll gate at Chittampatti on Madurai-Tiruchi National Highway stopped work briefly on Saturday in protest against the non-settlement of issues over salary payment by the management. Vehicles were let to pass without paying the toll for more than an hour. Police officers from Melur and Othakadai persuaded the workers to get back to work.\n\nAs toll collection resumed, police sources said that negotiations were conducted between the workers and the management following which an amicable agreement was reached later.",
