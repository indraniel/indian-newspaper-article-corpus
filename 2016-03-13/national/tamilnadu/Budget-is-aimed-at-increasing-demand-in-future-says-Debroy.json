    "text": "\u201cThere will be a two-quarter lag for private investment to follow public expenditure at current levels of underutilised private capacity and when this happens, aggregate demand will increase in the future,\u201d said NITI AAYOG member and economist Dr. Bibek Debroy while analysing the Union Budget at a speech at the SASTRA University here on Saturday.\n\nDr. Debroy\u2019s budget speech was part of the CUB Shri V. Narayanan Memorial Lecture organised by the SASTRA University in memory of the bank\u2019s late Chairman V. Narayanan.\n\nDr. Debroy said that Swachch Cess of 0.5 per cent was levied based on the recommendation of a group of Chief Minsters. About the perceived poor allocation for social sectors such as health and education, he said these were not in the Union List and the responsibility of the Centre was to focus on delivery in the Centrally-sponsored social schemes and not primary budgetary support.\n\nHighlighting the role of governments at all levels \u2013 Union, State and local bodies \u2014 he said the triple databases \u2013 socio economic caste census, the PM Jan-Dhan Yojana, and the AADHAR would be instrumental in ensuring that subsides, insurance benefits, and pension reached the deserving rural population while the government agencies ensured availability of public goods and services in a prioritised manner. Dr. Debroy encouraged students and other stakeholders to be more participative through mygov.in and make the budget-making exercise more democratic.\n\nS. Vaidhyasubramaniam, Dean, Planning and Development, SASTRA University, welcomed the gathering. He said this budget had shades of an Indian family \u2013 father\u2019s aspiration, mother\u2019s allocation, distant relative\u2019s objection, and astrologer\u2019s prediction.\n\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the City Union Bank N. Kamakoti proposed a vote of thanks.",
