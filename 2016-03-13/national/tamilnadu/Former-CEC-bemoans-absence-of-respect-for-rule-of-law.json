    "text": "In spite of having a wonderful Constitution and remarkable leaders, there was still scant respect for the rule of law, said the former Chief Election Commissioner, T. S. Krishnamurthy, on Saturday. Addressing the 19{+t}{+h}Graduation Day of the Subbalakshmi Lakshmipathy College of Science here, Mr. Krishnamurthy regretted that political parties catered to requirements of caste and creed and had \u201cscant respect for the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe country had a dynamic political democracy, vast pool of qualified scientific and technological personnel, large industrial and manufacturing sector, globally innovative and competitive managers, self-reliant and modern agriculture and an expanding services sector. There were good reasons to describe the eminence of India in the comity of nations. However, he said, \u201cthis joy and pride is disturbed with the continuing existence of poverty, disease, illiteracy, poor infrastructure, religious intolerance and social tensions between classes.\u201d There were controversies even in educational institutions. But \u201cthe world is so big to accommodate everybody,\u201d he said. The former CEC told the students that there was no need to be despondent or pessimistic any longer about the future as there were enormous opportunities not only in India but all over the world. Belief, he said, was the thermostat that regulated the active life of a human being. Faith and confidence in one\u2019s self would automatically make him a smart professional, he said, and wanted the young graduates to strengthen the power of belief in themselves.",
