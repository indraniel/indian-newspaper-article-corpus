Babu was living with his wife Pushpalatha (22), son Jeeva Bharathi (3), and daughter Preethi (1). Pushpalatha had gone to her parents\u2019 house the previous night.\n\nOn information, the police rushed to the spot and sent the body for postmortem. The police are yet to ascertain whether it was a case of suicide or murder. They were awaiting the postmortem report for ascertaining the cause of death.\n\nHowever, it was alleged that the victim had been threatened by a usurer, a month ago. \u201cI do not know whether it is suicide or murder. But my husband was threatened by a financier, who pestered him to pay Rs. 40,000 for availing a loan of Rs. 3,500 about 33 days ago,\u201d Ms. Pushpalatha alleged.\n\nShe said her husband was involved in odd jobs, including as acting driver, and was earning between Rs. 250 and Rs. 300 daily. He had taken the loan as he could not meet the expenses.\n\nThe body of Babu has been kept at Government Hospital in Srirangam for post-mortem. The Lalgudi police have filed a case under section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code.",
