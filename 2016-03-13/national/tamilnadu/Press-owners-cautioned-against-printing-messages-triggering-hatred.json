Moreover, the printing cost should also be declared while the printed materials and the forms are submitted since it will be added to the election expenditure. As the posters and pamphlets being released now are being videographed, any violation will be viewed seriously and cases registered under Section 171 H of Indian Penal Code,\u201d Dr. Karunakaran cautioned.\n\nDistrict Revenue Officer M.G.
