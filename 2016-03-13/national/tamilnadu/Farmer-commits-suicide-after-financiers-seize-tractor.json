He is said to have re-paid about Rs.5 lakh, but he did not pay remaining instalments.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of staff of the private finance company allegedly intercepted Alagar at V.Kaikatti and seized the tractor. Soon after the incident, Alagar consumed pesticide and was rushed to a hospital at Keezhapazhur where he died on Friday.\n\nPolice said no complaint was received and no case registered. The family is said to have cremated his body on Friday. They were unwilling to speak to the media.\n\nExpressing concern over the suicide, Raja Chidambaram, State Secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, condemned harassment of farmers and seizure of the vehicles by banks and financial institutions. He demanded sanction of Rs.10 lakh as compensation to the family of the deceased. Stating that many farmers were facing problems repaying loans obtained for tractors at high interest rates, he urged the Centre to extend soft loans to farmers. \u201cAll farm loans should be extended at four per cent simple interest and only then can such suicides be averted,\u201d he said. Suicide prevention helplines are available: the government (104), and Sneha, an NGO (044 24640050).",
