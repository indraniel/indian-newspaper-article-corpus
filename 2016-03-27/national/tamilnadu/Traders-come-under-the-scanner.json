    "text": "Greater Chennai Corporation has resumed its drive against commercial establishments that are operating without trade licences.\n\nRevenue Department officials have started to lock and seal commercial establishments on arterial roads that have failed to renew their trade licences.\n\nA few years ago, the civic body had identified 39,290 traders without trade licences in various localities within the city. The Corporation used data from agencies such as the Commercial Taxes Department to identify these traders who reportedly evaded payment of trade licence fee to the civic body.\n\nAfter the civic body decided to send legal notices to all the unregulated traders, the number of trade licences increased. Currently, officials have reportedly received complaints about a number of traders operating without a licence.\n\nThe officials of the civic body are likely to place under lock and seal more buildings of such traders.\n\nThe Corporation\u2019s request to traders asking them to renew trade licences had not evoked an adequate response so far, with a number of traders failing to get their licences.\n\nThe civic body is likely to identify all unregulated traders only after the Assembly elections.\n\nSome of the traders reportedly fail to renew the licences because of problems relating to no-objection certificates required from landlords of the buildings.\n\nTrades using illegal drainage connections are also not permitted to operate by the Health Department.",
