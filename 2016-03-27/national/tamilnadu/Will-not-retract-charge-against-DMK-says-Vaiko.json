Mr. Vaiko claimed that DMK president M. Karunanidhi would not have thought of filing a case against him and may not have been aware of such development till Friday.\n\nTamilisai joins issue\n\nMeanwhile, BJP State President Tamilisai Soundararajan has also taken exception to Vaiko\u2019s comments that the BJP had offered ministerial berths to Vijayakant in its attempt to woo him.\n\n\u201cVaiko has said that we negotiated with DMDK. It casts aspersions on Vijayakanth and Premalatha. It belittles the trust the two had reposed in Vaiko,\u201d she said. Besides showing his alliance partner in bad light, the statement has also smeared the reputation of the BJP, she added.\n\n(With additional reporting by Udhav Naig)",
