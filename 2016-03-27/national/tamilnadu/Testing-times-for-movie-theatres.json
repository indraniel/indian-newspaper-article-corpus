On a weekend, one would expect the cash registers to be ringing at the city\u2019s movie theatres. But it is that time of year again when the \u2018gentleman\u2019s game\u2019 throws a googly even as school and college exams make it testing times for the film industry.\n\n\u201cFor some shows, we have between five and 10 people sitting inside the hall,\u201d said an employee of one of the single-screen theatres near Majestic.\n\nAt a time when multiplex patrons are raising their voices against the exorbitant outing that going to the movies is turning out to be, the humble single-screen theatres are seeing near empty halls.\n\nThis is usually the case during March-April, say theatre staff.\n\nTicket price\n\nNagaraj (name changed), who has been working in a theatre in the Majestic area for the last 15 years, said, \u201cThe ticket prices are around Rs. 80, much lower than what people pay in multiplexes. So, we have our usual customers. But once the cricket and exam season starts, the theatre is empty.\u201d\n\nSix movies were released in the second week of March, none of which have seen substantial collections.\n\n\u201cThere is no loss to the theatre though, as they are paid a rent.\n\n\u2018The rent for a week to screen this film (points to the poster of a little known movie) is Rs. 3.5 lakh,\u201d Mr. Nagaraj added.\n\nThis time, two big cricketing events \u2013 the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup and the soon-to-start Indian Premier League \u2014 are casting a shadow on the prospects of movies.\n\nThe content of the film also matters, says filmmaker B. Suresh.\n\n\u201cMass entertainers look at releasing on long weekends, create hype and make maximum money in those few days.\n\n\u201cAfter that, there is an unbelievable drop in collections but they would have made their money by then. But, content and issue based cinema cannot afford such an opening.\n\nThey have to be screened when their target audience is free to watch a movie,\u201d he said.\n\nEveryone is busy during the exam season. However if a good film is released, you can be assured that it will still draw a full house even in March-April.\n\nK.V. Chandreshekhar\n\nformer founder-president, Film Exhibitors\u2019 Association\n\nMore than cricket, it is the exams that have an impact. Cricket matches are played throughout the year, but board exams come once in a student\u2019s lifetime.\n\nSoorappa Babu\n\nsecretary, Kannada Film Producers\u2019 Association\n\nBesides exams, the T20 World Cup and the soon-to-start IPL are keeping patrons away\n\nScreens in Karnataka\n\nNo. of multiplexes: 40\n\nNo. of single-screens: 980",
