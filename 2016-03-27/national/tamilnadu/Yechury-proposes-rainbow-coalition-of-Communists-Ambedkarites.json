Ambedkar.\n\nHe insisted that Communism is essential to realising Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s idea of India. \u201cThe red flag will always be a red flag because as long as human beings exist, blood will always be red and we will continue to fight. The blue flag is the other end of the spectrum of the rainbow: Vibgyor, starting from violet of the blue family and ending with the red family. Between blue and red are the entire colours of the universe. That is the rainbow; the CPI (M), I can assure you, is committed to building a rainbow coalition and that is the only way we can defend India today and create a better India tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is why the CPI (M) says that in India, we must understand this reality: all of us who want to change India for a better India stands on two legs. One leg is economic exploitation and the other leg is social oppression. Unless both these legs start moving, we cannot walk \u2013 forget running,\u201d he said\n\nMr. Yechury sought to bury the hatchet when it came to his ideological differences with Dr. Ambedkar and sought out commonalities. \u201c This is not the time to recollect what was said 70 years ago, 80 years ago. Today, India itself is under attack. So, today what is the commonality between Ambedkar, the Communists and the Indian patriots? That commonality is to create a better India, an India where there is no social oppression,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the gulf in understanding was inadvertently on show on Saturday. At one point during his speech while listing Dalit icons, Mr. Yechury said, \u201c\u2026.Mahatma Gandhi, who coined the term Harijan, that Dalits are children of God\u2026\u201d Ambedkar had rejected Mr. Gandhi\u2019s coinage, saying he preferred the term Dalit instead.\n\nEven as elections are due in West Bengal and Kerala, Mr. Yechury\u2019s gaze remained firmly on the campuses that have been sites of student agitation. More than offering leadership, he offered to stand alongside students \u2013 \u201csupport\u201d was a term he used repeatedly. Mr. Yechury recalled an argument he had with Rohith Vemula at the Hyderabad Central University and said that the Ambedkarite slogan of \u2018Jai Bhim\u2019 was as nationalist as any other. \u201cI\u2019ll shout Jai Bhim, I\u2019ll shout Lal Salam and all the slogans will converge into one slogan that Bhagat Singh gave \u2013 that the Communists give today \u2013 and that is, Inquilab Zindabad! Because we want an India where our political independence is transformed into the economic independence of all our people. It is possible only through Inquilab Zindabad. That is the new India; that is the convergence of Ambedkar and today\u2019s Communist parties, we work for that objective. For that, we have to close ranks and face the common enemy who wants to destroy the social unity and integrity of our country,\u201d he said.",
