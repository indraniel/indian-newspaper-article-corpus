Ramasubramanian, Judge of the Madras High Court.\n\nThe importance of Tamil language and literature was being highlighted in conferences and seminars. However, nothing was said on such occasions on the steps for the future development of the language. Encouraging writers would do a lot of good in promoting the language, Justice Ramasubramanian said at a function to distribute cash awards to outstanding Tamil works, and Literary Festival organised by the Salem Tamil Sangam here on Friday.\n\nResearch on languages had time and again proved that the languages whose writers were provided the right kind of encouragement and motivation had always flourished.\n\nThe authors and scholars should be honoured in their lifetime itself. Even top awards such as \u2018Gnanapeet\u2019 would be of no use for the next generation if the writers and scholars were not honoured at the right time.\n\nSeeni Duraisamy, president of Salem Tamil Sangam, presided over the function. Varadha Jayakumar, secretary, M. G. Rajan, treasurer, and K. Rajamohan, vice-president, spoke.\n\nJustice Ramasubramanian distributed K. Rajaram Literary awards to the following works: Poem category: \u2018Navakavi 1000\u2019 authored by Navakavi, \u2018Paesum Theru\u2019 by Krishna Prasad, \u2018Oru Adukku Maadi Kudiyiruppin Yezhavadu Thalam\u2019 by Valangaiman Nooruddin.\n\nNovel category: \u2018Samrat Asokan\u2019 by Sidharthan, \u2018Annam, Kanagam and Naan\u2019 by Vanaja David and \u2018Neerkolam\u2019 by Ulaganathan.\n\nBooks on research articles: \u2018Kumari Mavatta Tamizh Vazhakku\u2019 by Sujatha, \u2018Bharathi Pathinaru\u2019 by P. Marudanayagam and Tamizhar Valartha Tathuvangal\u2019 by Devaperinbam.\n\nTranslation works: \u2018Basan Nadakam\u2019 by A. Revathi, \u2018Kaanaga Palli Kadithangal\u2019 by A. S.
