Karunanidhi, had scaled new heights when the 2G spectrum scam unfolded.\n\nOn its part, the AIADMK further enriched the corrupt activities over the past five years as the public had to pay a hefty price for availing themselves of any service from the government departments.\n\n\u201cWith the ill-gotten money they have amassed, these parties will certainly try to purchase your votes by giving a few thousand rupees. If at all you have to take money for selling your votes, these two parties should give every voter at least Rs. 1 lakh, as every voter has suffered huge loss during the past 10 years as their governments had increased the price of milk, power tariff, bus fare and imposed a range of undue taxes,\u201d she noted.\n\nMs. Premalata rubbished all announcements made by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the Assembly under Rule 110, saying that none of these announcements translated into action. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but cheating the voters, who backed her in the previous polls,\u201d she added .\n\nWhile urging DMK president M. Karunanidhi to withdraw the legal notice he had served on Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko for his statement on a \u201csecret deal\u201d the DMK was trying to strike in its bid to bring the DMDK into its combine, Ms. Premalatha exuded confidence that Mr. Vaiko would face it legally. She explained in detail the salient features of DMDK\u2019s manifesto and assured the voters that the party would execute every promise made by the party if it is voted to power.",
