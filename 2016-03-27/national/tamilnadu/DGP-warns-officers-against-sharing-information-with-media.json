    "text": "The Director General of Police has issued a circular to all police officers in Tamil Nadu stating that they should not expose the identity of the accused or witness in an investigation to the media. He has warned that disciplinary action would be taken against them if they violate the order.\n\nThe circular by DGP Ashok Kumar states that some newspapers, on March 16, 2016, had published the photograph of accused involved in a murder case. It adds that the Madras High Court has taken serious view of this issue and has observed that publishing photographs of the accused in the media will hamper the test identification parade as witnesses could have a chance to see the accused in media before going to the parade and it will not have much evidentiary value.\n\nThe officers have also been asked to conduct in-service training to sensitise the police personnel in this regard. Sections of the media have expressed the opinion that this amounted to a gag order.\n\nSome newspapers published photograph of a murder accused recently",
