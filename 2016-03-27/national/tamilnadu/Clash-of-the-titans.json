    "text": "When Christopher Nolan rebooted Batman with Batman Begins (2005), it marked an important moment in the superhero genre. It not only removed terrible memories of the campy Batman movies from the late 90s, it shattered the fantastical aloofness that we attach to superheroes. Nolan\u2019s Batman Begins , that was followed by the brilliant The Dark Knight and the underwhelming but still pretty good The Dark Knight Rises , gave us a grey, humane character fighting post-modern battles.\n\nWe rooted for Nolan\u2019s Batman, played by Christian Bale, because we connected to the conflicts of his human heart and not because we were enamoured by the shine of the bat-suit.\n\nOn the flipside, \u2018dark superhero\u2019 became the new formula for studios, especially in the DC universe, paving way for movies such as Watchmen , Man of Steel , both directed by Zack Snyder. In Snyder\u2019s latest superhero juggernaut, we\u2019ve got Batman taking on Superman. Two of the greatest heroes of the DC universe: the last beacons of hope in a rotten world nearing its end, pitted against each other. It doesn\u2019t get darker than that, does it?\n\nThe problem with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is not that it\u2019s too dark. It\u2019s not even one of the common complaints against DC Comics, of \u2018taking itself too seriously\u2019. It\u2019s simply creatively bankrupt, gimmicky and quite boring.\n\nIt isn\u2019t thematically as interesting as you would expect it to be \u2013 there could have been perhaps an ideological battle of the two: the morally ambiguous vigilantism versus the old-fashioned gallantry. Or the heroes\u2019 fall from grace. Dawn of Justice dwells somewhere in the latter zone, but not quite.\n\nThis is a movie whose priorities aren\u2019t as much to do with giving us solid, simple reasons to empathise with its characters, as creating an event-movie out of \u2018The Greatest Gladiator Match in the History of the World\u2019. It drudges on for about two hours\u2014or what feels like two hours\u2014till it unleashes its USP.\n\nDespite such a build-up, the reason for the battle comes off as almost laughable: the film talks about things like \u2018democracy\u2019 and \u2018dialogue between citizens\u2019, but these qualities seem to elude Batman and Superman. They seem to be in a Cold War with each other.\n\nAnd yet, it never really adds up\u2014the rest of the world is burning and needs its superheroes, who seem preoccupied otherwise. Sharing the plot points would be giving out spoilers, but it is really easy to see how stupid the film\u2019s central conceit is. And even the event itself isn\u2019t worth the money and time. Snyder, who is known for his penchant for a distinct, if a tad overwrought, visual aesthetic, fails to create anything special in this department either. Barring a few scenes, such as Superman\u2019s lone fight with a Kryptonite weapon with Doomsday, Dawn of Justice doesn\u2019t look and feel much different from your average CGI-heavy, visually cluttered Hollywood disaster movie.\n\nMuch has been made of Ben Affleck playing Batman, after Bale\u2019s winning act in Nolan\u2019s series. Affleck\u2019s Batman is geared-up for more movies in the series. But his performance in this one is uninspired\u2014his perpetual smug face making it hard to connect to him emotionally. Where he adds heft, literally, is in the physicality. This is an older, greyer Bruce Wayne, and a more physically imposing Batman, his stocky build fitting into the heavily armoured bat-suit (CGI, apparently)\u2014this one takes reference from the comic series, The Dark Knight Returns . I haven\u2019t seen Man of Steel , but I liked Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman far more. Superman is an alien, and may have powers that equal God, but his relationships make him as vulnerable as the man he saves on the street \u2014 the film tries to tap into this side of Superman, but doesn\u2019t quite explore it. Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s Lex Luthor seems interesting initially \u2014 the business magnate whose megalomania masquerades as young, restless science-geekiness. But unlike great superheroes such as The Joker, he fails to make a case for himself. One of the few scenes that work\u2014shown in the trailers\u2014involve Luthor, Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent bumping into each other at a press conference. The casualness of the moment comes as a relief, amidst all the manufactured sombreness. But lighter touches such as this are few and far between.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Deadpool , which released almost a month ago, was lauded for its irreverence and self-aware humour. But Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the worst thing that could have happened to the genre.\n\nAt least there was a sinister surrealism in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman movies or a camp value to the ones starring George Clooney. This one is just annoyingly mediocre.sankhayan\n\nghosh\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nGenre:Action\n\nDirector:Zack Snyder\n\nCast:Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Jesse Eisenberg, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Gal Gadot\n\nStoryline:Superman and Batman have to set aside their differences, and along with Wonder Woman, stop Lex Luthor and Doomsday from destroying Metropolis.\n\nBottomline:Creatively bankrupt, gimmicky and boring",
