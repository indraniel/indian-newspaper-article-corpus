She said that she was subjected to verbal abuse every day. \u201cIt takes a lot for aged parents to come out and lodge a complaint. She has been bold enough; they usually take it all and bear the pain silently,\u201d said V. Sivakumar, joint director of HelpAge India. Every day, the organisation receives at least two calls from aggrieved senior citizens seeking help to deal with loneliness or abuse from their children. In a month, the number easily touches 40.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, it is financial crisis, fight over property or their children being unable to afford their stay,\u201d said R. Muthukrishnan, psychologist and manager at HelpAge helpline. \u201cWhile their longevity is increasing, thanks to medical care, their support systems are vanishing,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the elderly constitute 10.4 per cent of the total population of the State as against 8.6 per cent in the country.\n\nA study conducted by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) the same year states that more than half of the elderly in Tamil Nadu do not have any personal income.",
