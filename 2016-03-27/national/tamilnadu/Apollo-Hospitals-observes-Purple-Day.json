    "text": "The need to clear the myths surrounding epilepsy was stressed by doctors who took part in an awareness campaign on the disease organised by Apollo Speciality Hospitals at Sundaram Park here on Saturday as part of the Purple Day.\n\nMarch 26 is observed across the world as a day dedicated to patients with epilepsy to increase awareness of it.\n\nSpeaking at the campaign, consultant neurologists from the hospital said that the stigma and prejudice surrounding epilepsy still persisted in society because of which many patients did not come forward for treatment.\n\nPointing out the misconceptions surrounding the disease, the doctors said that a person having seizure should not be restrained and nothing should be placed in the mouth. On the myth of giving iron objects to the person having seizure, they said that though there was nothing wrong in it, the patients should not be given any sharp objects as they might accidentally hurt themselves.\n\nThey also said that while nearly 60 per cent of epileptics could be cured through medication, the rest could be reasonably controlled through advanced medicines available now.\n\nRohini Sridhar, Chief Operating Officer of Apollo Hospitals (Madurai Region), and Consultant Neurologists of Apollo Speciality Hospitals S.N. Karthik, P. Suresh and S. Meenakshi Sundaram participated in the campaign.",
