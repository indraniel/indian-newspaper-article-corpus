    "text": "AINRC Legislator P. Angalane, who had recently switched his loyalty to the Congress without resigning his MLA post, has the proverbial Damocles sword hanging on his head and much depends on whether the Assembly Speaker invokes the provisions of the Anti-defection Law.\n\nPolitical observers point out that Puducherry has always been presenting a murky political picture with most of the elected MLAs acting on their own and raising a banner of revolt against the party leadership on several occasions.\n\nElected Legislators shifting their loyalties to other political parties have virtually been a rule rather than an exception in the Union Territory of Puducherry.\n\nThe first instance of defection reported in the UT after the Anti-defection Law came into force was in 1987 when the AIADMK MLAs Dr. M.A.S. Subramanian and K. Anbalagan switched their loyalty from the AIADMK to the DMK.\n\nIn 1990, two MLAs \u2013 P. Rajavelu and Devinayagam belonging to the Janata Dal were disqualified after they defected to the Samajwadi Party. However, the then Speaker G. Perumalraja restored the membership of the two MLAs within hours of disqualification in the Assembly.\n\nThe third instance of defection was in 2000 when M. Manjini elected from the Mudaliarpet Assembly constituency on a CPI ticket shifted his allegiance to the PMK.\n\nMr. Manjini was immediately disqualified under the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India.\n\nLegislators shifting their loyalties have been a rule rather than an exception in Puducherry",
