With direct purchase, weavers got a major share and customers got satisfaction for the money spent.\n\n\u201cWe have come here to understand the tie and dye and craftsmanship in weaving Paramakudi cotton saris,\u201d said other members.\n\nCotton Trail not only popularised textiles of each region of the State but also helped the urban consumers shop smarter and know the right place to get the best buy, said T.N. Venkatesh, Managing Director, Co-optex, who led the team.\n\nThe move also helped get due recognition to each region that produced exclusive cotton varieties, he added.\n\nThe visitors would experience the craftsmanship of weavers and realise the value of the products.\n\n\u201cOur Pandian Cotton Trail is to popularise weaving centres in Karaikudi, know the nuances of weaving Chettinad cotton saris and technicalities of Sungadi saris in Madurai. Saris account for 50 per cent of the total sale of Co-optex. We have seen tremendous growth in cotton sari sales. Our previous successful Kora Trails in Sirumugai and Vadambacheri in Coimbatore have motivated us to organise more such trails. Now, textile trail has become very popular among consumers in southern States,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout 20 clusters in Dindigul, Paramakudi, Karaikudi and Madurai produce exclusive sari varieties. Weavers in Chinnalapatti have mastered the art of weaving Kora Silk in warp with mercerised cotton in weft, with tie and dye pattern in both body and pallu. Tie and dye experts from Madathukulam in Udumalpet narrated its technicalities to the members.",
