    "text": "A mazdoor attached to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) was electrocuted on Saturday at Chromepet.\n\nS. Udhayakumar (45) climbed a transformer on Grand Southern Trunk Road to carry out maintenance work. Though the power supply was cut off at the main supplying unit, the worker got electrocuted due to a sudden surge in the neighbouring unit. He was thrown off the post and was rushed to the Government hospital in Chromepet, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThere has been a hue and cry about staff members not adhering to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while carrying out maintenance and repair work on high-tension lines. Senior officials from Tangedco claimed the staff had adopted a careless approach, but the incident on Saturday was purely \u2018an accident\u2019. A departmental probe has been ordered to find out the reasons for the sudden surge in the power lines.\n\nTrade unions however charged that the maintenance work was being assigned to unskilled labourers and mazdoors who have problems climbing lamp posts.\n\nThey recalled an incident in which a 37-year-old field assistant S. Hari of Lakshmipuram, Chromepet, got electrocuted while climbing a transformer at Chromepet on June 8, 2015.\n\nSimilarly, Yuvaraj, 36, a field assistant, died when he came in contact with a high-tension line in July, 2015. Tangedco sources said safety rules and regulations were adhered to while attending to technical faults in the lamp posts and the transformers. Earth rods and gloves had been provided to the field staff who attended to faults.",
