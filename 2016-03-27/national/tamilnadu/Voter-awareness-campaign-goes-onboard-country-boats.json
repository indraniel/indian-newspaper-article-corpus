Gopala Sundara Raj said.\n\nStickers on family cards\n\nThe volunteers had also started pasting stickers stressing the importance of voting on family cards. Mr. Gopala Sundara Raj said that around 79,000 cardholders were residing in the constituency.\n\nLow turnout\n\nDuring the previous Assembly election in 2011, 73.66 per cent polling was recorded in Thoothukudi constituency, and the polling percentage in the last Lok Sabha elections in 2014 in the same constituency dropped to 67.89.\n\nHence, more awareness of polling was being spread through various programmes, he said.",
