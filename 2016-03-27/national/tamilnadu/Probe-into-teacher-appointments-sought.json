    "text": "The association representing candidates who had passed the National Eligibility Test and the State Eligibility Test have petitioned the Chief Minister\u2019s cell for a probe into teacher appointments in the last 10 years.\n\nThe test is a requirement for appointment as teachers in colleges and universities.\n\nThe NET/SLET Association, with around 50,000 members, has said they have no confidence in the current recruitment process. At present, the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) directly appoints teachers based on educational certificates they produce. \u201cWe fear large-scale violations in appointments. The certificates of all teachers recruited in the last 10 years should be scrutinised for genuineness,\u201d said association president R. Thangamuniandi. \u201cNot even four per cent of NET/SET qualified persons have got jobs through TRB,\u201d he alleged.",
