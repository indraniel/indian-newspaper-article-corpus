    "text": "The title Thozha , I must admit, gave me a slight case of the shivers. Given the cast\u2014the fifty-something Nagarjuna as quadriplegic billionaire Vikram; the thirty-something Karthi as his 180-degree opposite, a very local all-in-all-azhagu-raja named Seenu, who becomes Vikram\u2019s caretaker \u2014I expected May-December variations on the perennial Kollywood theme of natpu .\n\nBut Vamsi Paidipally\u2019s film is cut from a different cloth. It opens with a sad-looking Vikram and a pensive Seenu in a car.\n\nThey seem to be in the midst of a lover\u2019s tiff\u2014or whatever the bromantic equivalent is. But soon, the tone changes. We get a chase.\n\nWe get hammy comedy. The film\u2019s strength is that it never gets too heavy. (And there are heavy themes. Face your fears. Search for happiness at the place you lost it. Motivational poster companies will be taking furious notes). Every time we think something serious lies ahead, there\u2019s a nifty U-turn. Thozha works... despite itself.\n\nI say this because as cinema, there\u2019s nothing here. The staging is broad, as are the performances. The storytelling has no finesse. What we\u2019re seeing on screen are basically pages of the script. With pigeon metaphors. (Before Vikram meets the free-spirited Seenu, we see a bird struggling to take off. Later, it soars.)\n\nThe melodrama is laughable. There\u2019s actually a scene where Seenu goes to a rich man\u2019s bungalow (Seenu\u2019s sister is in love with the man\u2019s son), and the man, looking down from his room, instructs his servant, \u201c Avana lawn-leye nikka sollu .\u201d I kept waiting for the follow-up, where the man talks to Seenu while tossing biscuits at his Alsatian. What we get is close enough\u2014cut-aways to a barking dog. There\u2019s some alarmingly crude comedy, especially in a bit involving a gay character.\n\nAnd the super-aggressive score is essentially Gopi Sunder holding a gun to your temple and screaming: \u201cLaugh.\u201d \u201cCry.\u201d \u201cFeel warm-fuzzy.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. We laugh. We cry. We feel warm-fuzzy. Thozha is a remake of the French dramedy The Intouchables , and while the class issues aren\u2019t as incisively (or delicately) dealt with, the bonding between the men comes through beautifully. That much-abused term \u201conscreen chemistry\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what the thing between Karthi and Nagarjuna is. Raja Murugan writes some lovely lines for Seenu (during a drunken night, during his interview with Vikram)\u2014we wished there\u2019d been more.\n\nBut he also knows when to write less. When Seenu, after a jail term, returns to a family that seems to despise him, his mother (Jayasudha) simply says, \u201c Edhukku vandhe ?\u201d\n\nThese emotional beats are, strictly speaking, excess baggage\u2014the film runs for nearly three hours, and there\u2019s enough emotion in the Seenu-Vikram stretches\u2014but if you have to have amma -sentiment, thamb i-sentiment, thangachi -sentiment, then this is probably the way to do it, with minimal fuss.\n\nBut despite these nods to Kollywood tradition, Thozha is different. It\u2019s heavy-handed, yet light. It\u2019s... pleasant. It\u2019s like Bangalore Days . There are no external villains to punch into orbit\u2014the conflicts are all internal. And everyone\u2019s fundamentally nice.\n\nWhen Vikram ends up hospitalised due to a lapse on Seenu\u2019s part, I thought there\u2019d be a showdown, with Vikram\u2019s friend (Prakash Raj) blaming Seenu\u2014but the scene that follows is a surprise, building on an amusing running gag about abstract art. Even the women around Vikram (they\u2019re played by Anushka and an astonishingly pretty Shriya Saran) have mini-arcs that are utterly unexpected.\n\n\u201cClosure\u201d isn\u2019t something we see in Kollywood films every day. Neither is the dignified first date. Throughout Thozha , we get the sense of a certain sensibility being respected, even as certain concessions to local audiences are being made.\n\nThozha may be Karthi\u2019s most important film since Paruthiveeran . That was an incandescent debut, but he seemed to have given so much of himself to that film that it appeared there was nothing left, nothing new.\n\nHe seemed to be coasting along on a set of Karthi-isms (even in interesting and varied films like Madras and Aayirathil Oruvan ).\n\nAs an actor, Thozha is no breakthrough\u2014performance-wise, we still get the same -isms. (It will be interesting to see what Mani Ratnam does with the actor in the film they\u2019re reportedly making together.) But as a star, this is a welcome move.\n\nAt a time when every leading man (including Karthi) seems to be participating in a game-show titled Who Wants To Be The Next Rajinikanth ?, here\u2019s a simple \u201cbuddy movie\u201d (in the Hollywoodian sense), with no punch dialogues, no action sequences, with just one duet (with Tamannaah, who plays Vikram\u2019s secretary; her romance with Seenu is strangely unresolved). We see, all the time, character actors striving to become larger-than-life heroes. For a change, here\u2019s a hero scaling himself down to play a life-sized character.\n\nbaradwaj rangan\n\nThozha\n\nGenre:Drama\n\nDirector:Vamsi Paidipally\n\nCast:Nagarjuna, Karthi, Tamannaah, Prakash Raj\n\nStoryline:A bromance between a fifty-something billionaire and his thirty-something caretaker\n\nBottomline:Not great cinema, but an entertaining film",
