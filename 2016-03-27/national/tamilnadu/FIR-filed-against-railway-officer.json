    "text": "A first information report (FIR) has been registered against Ajeet Saxena, the Chief Commercial Manager of Southern Railway, at Flower Bazaar police station in connection with an incident earlier this week, when a section of women railway employees barged into his office.\n\nFollowing a complaint from one of the women employees, a case has been registered against the officer under Sections 504 and 506 \u2014 intentional insult and criminal intimidation, among other sections, of Indian Penal Code.\n\nInvestigating policemen said they would be making a detailed investigation and if the allegation against the railway officer were false, the case would be dropped.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of women employees barged into Mr. Saxena\u2019s office and under the pretext of raising grievances, created a ruckus.\n\nSouthern Railway sources said the women had not sought a prior appointment and made false charges against the officer.\n\nThe incident drew sharp reactions from railway unions with some of them accusing their rivals of instigating the women employees against the officer, who, they said, was trying to crack down on certain malpractices by a section of the employees.\n\nNine of the women employees were placed under suspension, sources added.",
