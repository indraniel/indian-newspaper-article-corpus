    "text": "The wholesale price of egg was increased by 10 paise to be fixed at Rs. 3.45 here on Saturday.\n\nOfficials of the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC), Namakkal Zone, said that though intense heat was affecting the poultry resulting in drop in egg production, there was an increase in demand for eggs across the country. They added that the domestic demand in Tamil Nadu and Kerala was expected to pickup in the coming days as festival season was over and consumption rate would increase in coming weeks.\n\nOn March 1, the price of egg was Rs. 3.20 and increased to Rs. 3.33 on March 7. However, it dropped to Rs. 3.15 on March 17 and increased to Rs. 3.25 later. They said that the average price of egg in March was Rs. 3.27 when compared to Rs. 2.55 during the corresponding month last year.",
