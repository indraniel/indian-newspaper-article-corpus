    "text": "Dravidar Kazhagam leader K. Veeramani on Saturday accused MDMK general secretary Vaiko of attempting to betray the Dravidian organisation that nurtured him (DMK) and gave him an address for current political mileage. Mr. Veeramani\u2019s remarks come in the backdrop of Mr. Vaiko\u2019s claim that the DMK offered a huge sum to the DMDK in a bid to lure it to strike a poll deal.\n\nIn a brief interaction with journalists on the sidelines of the Periyar Maniammai University convocation, Mr. Veeramani alleged that Mr. Vaiko would always try to wear his loyalty on his sleeve and portray himself as more loyal than the king in whatever political alliance he was in.\n\n\u201cCasting aspersions on DMK president M. Karunanidhi is uncivilised and untruthful. This has been borne out of the statement made by DMDK leader Vijayakant\u2019s wife Premalatha countering Mr. Vaiko\u2019s allegation,\u201d Mr. Veeramani said.\n\nAmong the alliances in the State, only the DMK-Congress combine has ideological affinity, he claimed.",
