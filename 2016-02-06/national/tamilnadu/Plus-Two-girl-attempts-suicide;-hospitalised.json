Janaki claimed that the girl attempted suicide due to harassment by the school teachers, the school authorities denied the allegations.\n\nFamily members said that the girl\u2019s father passed away in June 2014 and her mother had separated.\n\nThe girl and her younger sister, also studying plus one in the same school, were under the care of Ms. Janaki.\n\nAccording to Ms. Janaki, the girl was sent back from school a week ago as she had symptoms of small pox. When she went back to school on Friday, her class teacher and headmaster allegedly scolded her for not being regular and raising allegations against the school to higher authorities.\n\n\u201cI had petitioned the District Collector before against the school for demanding more than the prescribed fee,\u201d Ms. Janaki said.\n\nShe said that her granddaughter was sent back from school on Friday. \u201cShe came back and consumed pills when I was away form home,\u201d Janaki said. She added that the girl\u2019s condition was critical and the doctors had suggested that she be kept under observation for two days.\n\nRefuting the allegations, P. Purushothaman, Headmaster of the school, said, \u201cThe girl had not come to school for many days.\n\nIt was we who asked her sister this morning to call her grandmother and ask her to come to school so that we can enquire about the girl,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the allegations of charging additional fee, Mr. Purushothaman said that, considering the family situation of the girls, both were given complete relaxation from paying any fee. \u201cEven their uniforms were provided from school,\u201d he claimed.\n\nWhen contacted, Chief Educational Officer of Madurai district, J. Angelo Irudayasamy, said that he was yet to ascertain the facts about the incident and an inquiry will be conducted soon.",
