A tobacco-based product, it is sold in sachets, each at Rs. 12. Teachers and parents are perturbed by the fact that students have easy access to such materials.\n\n\u201cCool Lip is sold in small sachets in many petty shops. Students roll it under their tongue even during class hours and sit in a daze,\u201d said a teacher of a government school in Kolathur on condition of anonymity.\n\nMeanwhile, another teacher from a government school in Saidapet said that many dropouts sell these intoxicants. \u201cThese children sell these substances to their former classmates. We cannot question them as they may even hit the teachers,\u201d the teacher added.\n\nR. Ardhanari, a former government school headmaster, said he was aware of a few students using such substances regularly.\n\n\u201cThey get a \u2018kick\u2019 from it. This habit affects their concentration and studies,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to teachers, it is difficult to get these children to give up this habit.\n\nA senior Corporation official said it was completely up to the headmaster of the school to take action.\n\n\u201cPetty shops should not sell such tobacco products in and around schools. The Principal concerned can inform the police and take action against them.
