    "text": "With the next Assembly elections due in a few months, several senior citizens\u2019 associations have asked the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government to fulfil one of the promises it had made in the run-up to the previous Assembly elections.\n\nThe AIADMK had promised to provide free bus passes for those aged above 58 years in its manifesto. Several forums for the elderly have pointed out that the promise has remained unfulfilled.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Elders Welfare Association had earlier passed a resolution in its meeting demanding that the government issue orders ensuring free travel for senior citizens on Metropolitan Transport Corporation buses.\n\nS.M. Chellaswamy, the association\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe free bus pass scheme for senior citizens may not affect the revenue of the government. Many pensioners spend at least 10 per cent on travel every month. The government now provides 10 per cent concession on fares on buses operated by the Tamil Nadu State Express Transport Corporation.\u201d\n\nThe association has also represented the issue to the Transport Minister. North Chennai Senior Citizens Welfare Association too has submitted a petition to the Chief Minister\u2019s cell, seeking speedy implementation of the free bus passes scheme.\n\nAssociation members said that though the association received a response that the demand would be scrutinised, the scheme was yet to be executed.\n\nAt least 10% of pension is spent on travel, says The Tamil Nadu Elders Welfare Association",
