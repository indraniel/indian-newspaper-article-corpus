    "text": "The three-day strike by power loom owners in Pallipalayam came to an end after the textile units agreed to increase the job processing charges from Rs. 35 to Rs. 39 for four towels. There are over 400 power loom units in Pallipalayam that manufacture towels in bulk quantities for the textile units. They were paid Rs. 45 as charges for manufacturing four towels weighing 90 gram. But, the charges were reduced over the year with the loom owners paying only Rs. 35. Hence, demanding increase in charges, power loom owners began an indefinite strike from February 2. On Thursday, loom owners held talks with textile unit owners in Erode. While loom owners demanded Rs. 40 as charges, textile unit owners finally decided to pay Rs. 39. Power loom owners agreed and the strike was withdrawn. Production activities began on Friday morning.",
