It may be recalled that at a time when the Mettur Dam shutters were expected to be closed last month, Chief Minister ordered release of 6,000 cusecs of water from the dam from January 28 to February 25 for the benefit of the farmers who commenced farm operations late and also taking into account the Mahamaham festival in Kumbakonam town.\n\nThe water level in the Mettur dam stood at 69.36 feet on Friday evening against its full level of 120 feet.",
