    "text": "Owners of power loom job working units, who are on a strike since January 28, have postponed the decision to go on a fast from February 7.\n\n\u201cThe decision has been taken as the authorities concerned promised to hold talks involving us and textile unit owners on February 9\u201d, said R. Velusamy, president of Tirupur District Job Work Power Loom Weavers\u2019 Association.\n\nThe power loom job working units owners went on an indefinite strike as they were reportedly not given the job work charges at the revised slabs mentioned in the agreement they signed in 2014 with the textile unit owners for whom fabrics were produced.\n\n\u201cAccording to the pact with the textile unit owners, we have to be given an upward revision of 27 per cent on the job work charges from the then existed charges. However, the revised rates have been given only for the first few months\u201d, said Mr. Velusamy.",
