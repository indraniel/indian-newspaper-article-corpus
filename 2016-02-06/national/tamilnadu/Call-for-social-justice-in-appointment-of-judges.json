However, to maintain social justice, it is essential to provide adequate representation to the downtrodden, other Backward Classes and women in the case of elevation of judges,\u201d he said in his farewell address.\n\nRequesting the Chief Justice and the collegium of judges to consider social justice in judges\u2019 appointments, Justice Mr. Tamilvanan said, \u201cThough I have never been in a political, communal or caste-based organisation, I am interested in social justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless, we create a conducive atmosphere, by providing reasonable opportunity to all sections of people, we cannot imagine anything on the implementation of fundamental rights, especially equality before law as enshrined in the Constitution,\u201d the judge said.\n\nJustice Mr. Tamilvanan was elevated as a judge of Madras High Court in 2005.\n\nRetiring judge makes an appeal to Chief Justice, collegium",
