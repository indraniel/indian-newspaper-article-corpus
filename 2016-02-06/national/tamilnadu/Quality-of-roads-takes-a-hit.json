    "text": "With contractors attributing drop in quality of roads that are being re-laid to shortage in bitumen, Greater Chennai Corporation on Friday started initiatives to fix the problem. As contractors pointed to bitumen shortage in IOC, HPCL and BPCL, the Greater Chennai Corporation on Friday conducted an emergency meeting with suppliers.\n\nSome contractors claimed that they also ended up procuring bitumen of substandard quality due to the shortage. During previous instances of sample examination, the Corporation had penalised contractors who had been found to reduce the quantity of bitumen to increase profit. The civic body has stringent norms for road relaying.\n\n\u201cThe supply has reduced to one-third of the requirement per day. But we are being forced to speed up the work ahead of Assembly elections. The material procured from a few private players was also substandard,\u201d said a contractor.\n\nCorporation officials said they feared that new roads that contained lesser quantity of bitumen could fall apart in a few months.\n\nThe civic body on Friday gave the companies the requirement schedule of bitumen.\n\n\u201cConsidering the extensive damages caused by floods to the roads, the main supplier, IOCL, and the other two suppliers have agreed to enhance their production capacity so that the supply is adequate,\u201d said an official of Chennai Corporation.\n\nOut of the production quantity of 2,200 tonnes, IOCL has agreed to apportion bitumen to Greater Chennai Corporation on a priority basis. BPCL has agreed to bring stock from Kochi and HPCL from Visakhapatnam.\n\n\u201cA nodal officer will prepare the work and bitumen requirement schedules and will channelise the schedules to the companies,\u201d said the official.",
