    "text": "The Alliance for Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF) has urged External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is in Colombo on a two-day visit, to secure the release of 79 mechanised fishing trawlers impounded by the Sri Lankan government after its navy arrested the fishermen on charges of poaching.\n\nIn a memorandum sent to Ms. Swaraj, a copy of which was made available to The Hindu here on Friday, ARIF founder-president U. Arulanandham requested her to initiate diplomatic action and secure the release of the trawlers and 15 Tamil Nadu fishermen languishing in Lankan prisons.\n\nGiving the list of registration numbers of the impounded boats and details of the fishermen who owned the boats, he said that the Lankan authorities, after releasing the fishermen, detained the boats with an ulterior motive to crush the livelihood of the hapless fishermen.\n\nRequest\n\nMr. Arulanandham also requested the Minister to take up the fishermen issue with the Lankan government and find a lasting solution by arranging resumption of fishermen-level talks, deadlocked after the second round of talks held in Colombo on May 12, 2014.\n\nTill the Tamil Nadu fishermen took to tuna long liner fishing and found alternative livelihood, they should be vested with the traditional fishing rights in the Palk Bay, he said.\n\nThe fishermen should be given time to phase out trawling and till then the Lankan navy should be restrained from arresting them, he said.",
