The posters derive its idea from popular culture. For instance, one of the posters urges the youngest voter, \u2018You know what you need to do when you turn 18\u2019, a play on the popular movie \u201936 Vayadhinile\u2019 starring actor Jyothika.\n\n\u201cTamil Nadu has 24 lakh voters who are around 18-19 years of age. Of this, around 18 lakh voters are registered, leaving 6 lakh unregistered voters. We want our campaign to speak directly to the youth in their own lingo instead of putting out our usual government ads. So far, the campaign has worked very well,\u201d says Rajesh Lakhoni, Chief Electoral Officer, who is in charge of the State Assembly elections in 2016.\n\nThe advertising company, Opn Advertising, has been roped in to run a campaign that would resonate with the youth of Tamil Nadu. The agency designs posters based on popular trending topics.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do the preachy ads. So, we take ideas from what is trending on social media. For instance, we improvised on \u2018Be Like Bill\u2019 memes and played around with movie names and popular dialogues. The idea was to recycle popular culture to reiterate our campaign,\u201d says Bala Manian, director (Strategy), Opn Advertising.\n\nMr. Bala says that the Election Commission has been co-operative and willing to do things differently. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be seen as bureaucratic. They wanted to really reach out to people to get as many people to vote,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe have been getting many calls from voters who want to know how to register,\u201d Mr. Lakhoni said.\n\nPosters and memes drive campaign to bring youth to polling booths",
