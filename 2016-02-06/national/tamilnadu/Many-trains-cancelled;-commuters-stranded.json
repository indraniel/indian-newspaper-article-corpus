He was postponing his trip to Bengaluru, he said.\n\nMany other passengers, after they were informed that all Bengaluru-bound trains were cancelled, either postponed their plans or hired cabs and autos and rushed to Koyambedu to board government buses from Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus or omni buses from the private bus terminus, commercial staff at the helpline said.\n\nHelpline\n\nSouthern Railway\u2019s helpline at Chennai Central station received plenty of calls from passengers checking the status of departure of trains from Chennai towards Coimbatore via Jolarpettai and Salem. They were informed that all trains on that route were being operated as schedule. K.P.Gurunath, who travelled on the Chennai \u2013 Bengaluru \u2013 Mysuru Shatabdi Express, thanked Southern Railway and the State Transport Department for arranging buses at Jolarpettai. \u201cThe train, scheduled to leave at 6 a.m., left after a delay of 40 minutes. We were initially told that an engine snag was the reason. But during the journey, we received SMS from friends and relatives about the derailment of Island Express,\u201d he said. At Jolarpettai, they were informed that their train was terminated there. \u201cWe were relieved that there were no major casualties. We were also pleasantly surprised when we saw buses arranged for taking us to Bengaluru without any halt in between,\u201d Mr. Gurunathan told The Hindu.\n\nSouthern Railway officials in Chennai said the Vellore district administration had arranged for 15 buses to pick up the stranded passengers at Jolarpettai.
