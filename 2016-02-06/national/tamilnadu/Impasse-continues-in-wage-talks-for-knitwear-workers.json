    "text": "Stalemate continues in reaching a new wage pact for knitwear sector workers as the trade unions stood firm on their demands during the talks held between the trade unionists and textile association representatives on Friday.\n\nWhen the trade unions stated that they wanted a 100 per cent hike on basic wages, the knitwear manufacturers put forward the view that they could give 19 per cent hike from the wages in the previous four-year pact, which ceased to exist on January 30.\n\nAs the trade unionists did not soften the stance, the textile unit owners said that they would come back to the trade unions after discussing with the respective members of the six textile associations.\n\nNext talks\n\n\u201cWe will be holding the next round of talks with trade unions on February 16\u201d, said the representatives of various textile associations.\n\nM. Chandran, State secretary of CITU, said it was demanded that apart from the hike in basic wages, the workers should be given house rent allowance and also education allowance for their children. \u201cWithout house rent allowance, it will be difficult for the knitwear industry to retain the skilled workforce as house rents have been soaring in the cluster during the last many years\u201d, he added.",
