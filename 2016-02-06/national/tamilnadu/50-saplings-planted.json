    "text": "Pondicherry Original Nativity Good Health Improvement Organisation has planted 50 saplings at Gorimedu a fortnight back. The organisation aims to plant at least one lakh saplings across Puducherry in the next two years.\n\nA.Razalikhan, who heads the organisation, said that they initiated this programme since many trees are destroyed to build the city. There is increase in pollution. \u201cTherefore, we decided to plant saplings in every street in Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam,\u201d he said.\n\nOn February 10, nearly thousand saplings would be planted at Police Grounds and quarters. Trees that provide shade would be the ones chosen for this programme. \u201cWe would take permission from each house to plant the saplings. School and college students would be involved in this programme,\u201d he said.",
