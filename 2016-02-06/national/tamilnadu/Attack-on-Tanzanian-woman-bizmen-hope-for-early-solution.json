For, the arrival of foreign students had changed fortunes for the local community, which is now worried.\n\nShop-owners and landlords there and nearby places like AGB Layout, Chimney Hills and MEI Layout, are now hoping for an early solution.\n\n\u2018Benefits all\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen the college first opened, we used to give a one bedroom house for a monthly rent of around Rs. 1,000. It has increased to around Rs. 6,000. The village has so many hotels and places for rent and the arrival of students has benefited all of us. We try and interact with the students anyway we can. Being violent towards them is of no benefit to us,\u201d said Vinayak, a provision store owner in Soladevanahalli who also lets out houses in his building for rent.\n\n\u201cThere are stretches of road between Soladevanahalli and the Tumakuru Road near 8{+t}{+h}Mile where most of the skirmishes take place.\n\nThey include places in Chikka Banavara, Bagalkunte and other small villages that do not benefit from students. These stretches also have several bars and no street lights,\u201d says Gangadhar, a landlord in MEI layout.",
