    "text": "Demanding that natural gas pipelines should be laid only along with National Highways and not through agriculture lands, members of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam staged a protest near Anna Statue at Old Bus Stand in Tiruchengode here on Friday.\n\nLed by district president Adinarayanan, State vice-president of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Growers\u2019 Association S. Nalla Gounder and sangam\u2019s district secretary P. Perumal, the members said that due to stiff opposition from people in Kerala, the pipeline was not laid through agricultural fields from Cochin to the State border. The pipeline proposed to be laid through 310 km farm fields in the Western districts would affect over 3,000 farmers. Despite many protests by the farmers, the court\u2019s order is shocking, they said. Members wanted the State government to file a review petition in the apex court.",
