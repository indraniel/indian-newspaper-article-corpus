Karunanidhi should become the Chief Minister if Tamil Nadu has to get on to the road of development, and for people to live with self-respect.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years of the AIADMK government, not a single infrastructure project has been implemented in the State. If industries have to come in Tamil Nadu, infrastructure such as road and airport have to be established, to pave way for economic growth and create job opportunities for youth,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that the law and order situation has worsened in the State, and women no longer feel safe.\n\nCriticising the government\u2019s stand on closure of TASMAC outlets, she said the government was concerned about revenue but was not worried about young widows and youngsters turning into alcoholics.\n\nShe assured that prohibition will be enforced in the State if Mr. Karunanidhi was voted to power.\n\nReferring to the death of three students in Villupuram, she said, \u201cOfficials failed to act when the students had attempted suicide a year ago as they could not tolerate harassment by the college management. The parents of Saranya, one of the students, said that the handwriting in the suicide note was not their daughter\u2019s.\u201d",
