Siva Saravanan\n\nResidents of a few housing colonies in Podanur staged a protest on Tuesday saying that the Coimbatore Corporation was planning to divert water meant for their areas at a time when they faced water shortage.\n\nThe residents of Shriram Nagar, Arul Murugan Nagar, Indira Nagar, Mettu Thottam, P&T Colony and other areas alleged that the Corporation had originally planned to directly fill a sump in Shriram Nagar by tapping water from the Pilloor I scheme pipeline that was in the vicinity.\n\nThe project was aimed at improving water supply by pumping the water from the sump to the overhead tank before distribution.\n\nResidential localities\n\nBut, the residents alleged that the Corporation had altered the pipeline pathway in such a way that the water tapped from the Pilloor scheme pipeline also went to a few residential localities in the nearby Ward 100.\n\nThey said that at present the Corporation supplied Siruvani water only once in 10 \u2013 15 days.\n\nIf the Corporation were to go ahead with its plan, they would see no improvement in supply.\n\nCorporation officials, who rushed to the spot, said that the force of water flowing into the sump from the Pilloor pipeline would be such that there would be enough water for all, including the Ward 100 residents.\n\nThere was no need to be apprehensive about lack of improvement in water supply as the water supply would improve to once a week, they added.",
