    "text": "The Congress high command is likely to form a high-level committee consisting of senior leaders of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) to manage all strategies for the upcoming Assembly elections.\n\nSources said the move was to ensure better coordination in the faction-ridden unit in Tamil Nadu, where multiple groups have openly ridiculed each other in the last few months.\n\n\u201cThe committee will take care of all electoral strategies, including alliance talks and identification of candidates. With elections just months away, the high command feels total coordination was crucial to improve the chances of the party,\u201d a leader said, on condition of anonymity.\n\nApart from TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan, the committee may include former Union Ministers P. Chidambaram, Sudarasana Natchiappan, Su. Thirunavukkarasar and former TNCC presidents K.V. Thangkabalu and M. Krishnaswamy.\n\nSources added that the TNCC has been worried about the delay in starting work for the elections. The high command has still not given its nod to receive applications from aspiring candidates. There has also been very little progress on the alliance aspect, with the DMK awaiting the decision of the DMDK to initiate talks. Meanwhile, Mr. Elangovan met national general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu, Mukul Wasnik, in New Delhi on Friday. Impressed by the support that Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi had received after his participation in a fast in Hyderabad on Rohit Vemula suicide incident, the TNCC has requested Mr. Gandhi to visit the families of three girls of the SVS Naturopathy and Yoga College who were found dead last month.",
