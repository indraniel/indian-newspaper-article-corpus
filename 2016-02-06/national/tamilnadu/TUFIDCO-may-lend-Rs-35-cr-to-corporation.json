A sum of Rs. 1 crore is sought for construction of retaining walls.\n\nA senior official of the corporation told The Hindu that it had sent the Detailed Project Report (DPR) to TUFIDCO. It had been appraising the report. It was likely to accept the proposal. The modalities and components of loan would be known shortly.\n\nIf the proposal was accepted, it would enable the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation to relay and develop city roads. Several roads were badly damaged in different parts of the city in recent rains. The corporation council had passed a resolution seeking financial assistance for developing roads in the city.\n\nVoices were raised for relaying the roads, lanes and bylanes, which are lounging for the attention of authorities for more than 10 years. Residents have demanded that major portion of the scheme should be used for developing interior roads in the city.",
