The Government should also play a more proactive role and introduce heritage regulation and guidelines to ensure buildings that are over 100 to 150 years old are not demolished.\n\n\u201cThough Puducherry does not have iconic monuments like Taj Mahal, Qutub Minar and the Meenakshi Temple, tourists still visit the city to see the streetscapes, the French and Tamil quarters, the layout, grid plan, seashore and the peaceful life all of which together make Puducherry a heritage place,\u201d Mr. Piplani said.\n\n\u201cWe can only improve on this by conducting heritage walks, training programmes and workshops for private homeowners like what incentives can be given to them to showcase Puducherry as a heritage town,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Piplani said that the use of non-conventional materials like Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) for reconstruction of heritage buildings in Puducherry will set a precedent and completely wipe out the historic layers \u201cEveryone who is either for the reconstruction of the Marie or against reconstruction should make their opinion heard or arrive at a consensus. Neither the experts nor the government decides but it is the people of Puducherry who ultimately decide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGovt. should ensure that buildings that are over 100 to 150 years old are not demolished\u201d",
