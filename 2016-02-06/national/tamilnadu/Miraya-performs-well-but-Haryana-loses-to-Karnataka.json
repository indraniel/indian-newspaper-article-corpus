Though her appearance has been widely anticipated, Ms. Priyanka has not yet ventured to visit the venue.\n\nAfter a loss to the Kerala girls by 63-45 in the third league, Haryana had a lot to play for in the match against Karnataka. In the third quarter, Miraya was allowed a free throw by referee and she scored.\n\nKarnataka scored 69 to Haryana\u2019s final tally of 47.\n\nMathab Singh, coach of Haryana girls team said the team was not able to win because two players in team were ill.\n\nMiraya\u2019s team will next face Telangana in their pre-quarterfinal match.\n\nMeanwhile, some members of the audience have complained of poor air-conditioning at the venue.
