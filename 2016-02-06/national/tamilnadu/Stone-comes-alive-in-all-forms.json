What is rescued for operations is hardly five per cent of the availability. We need to address the situation with care to raise our export market to Rs. 1 lakh crore in the next three years, from the present Rs. 15,000 crore,\u201d said Mr. Balvinder Kumar.\n\nThe fair brings the choicest stones slabs, machinery tools and art decoratives from across the world. The event is on till February 6.\n\nThe towering 8 feet statue of former President (late) Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam by Kani Granites of Coimbatore is a crowd puller. \u201cI have sourced jet-black granite from Chamarajanagar near Mysuru to make his replica,\u201d informs V.S.S. Pillai of Kani Granites.\n\nIt took 45 days of meticulous work for 10 people to complete this statue.",
