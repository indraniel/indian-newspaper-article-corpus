    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Friday issued fresh non-bailable arrest warrants against 12 of the 17 accused in the 2007 Dinakaran newspaper office attack case after Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) reported that it could not execute the warrants issued by the court on January 27 along with a direction to produce the accused by February 4.\n\nJustices A. Selvam and G. Chockalingam directed the High Court Registry to issue fresh warrants to the investigating agency and adjourned the hearing to March 11.\n\nThe warrants were issued since it was felt that the accused were \u201cplaying hide and seek\u201d with the court by not cooperating in disposing of an appeal filed by CBI in 2010 challenging their acquittal from the case in 2009.",
