Siva Saravanan\n\nState Highways Department has started works on a bridge at Podanur, across the railway crossing.\n\nAn official of the department said that the Rs. 25-crore project will be completed in one-and-a-half years. A road over bridge will be constructed for 833 metres (including the railway portion) and it will be 12 metres wide. There will be 5.5 metre wide service roads on either side. The project involves acquisition of land to the extent of 12,000 sq.mt. Nearly 9,000 sq.mt is railways land and the remaining are patta land, the official said.\n\nTraffic diverted\n\nThe department is waiting for permission to take the railway land on lease for 35 years. Traffic has been diverted on the stretch after getting approval from the Collector.\n\nGeetha, a resident of Podanur, says the railway line passes through three locations at and near Podanur.\n\nRoad over bridge work has been taken up at only one location. For the works at this crossing, the traffic diversions are at two places and those residing in colonies near the railway crossing are affected. Residents who have two-wheelers are able to use the by-lanes.\n\nHowever, children going to school by autorickshaw or school vans have to come to a place before the diversion starts to board the bus or auto. Road over bridges should be constructed at the other two crossings, too, for the benefit of the public, she says.",
