Dakshinamoorthy, District Collector, in his inaugural address, said that the Consumer Protection Act was implemented in 1986. The government organised various programmes, particularly in the education institutions, with the objective of creating consumer awareness among the younger generation.\n\nThe eatables which will have harmful impact on the health of the people will automatically vanish from the scene, if all sections of society boycotted the same.\n\nThe younger generation should take a vow that they will consume only natural traditional drinks and avoid other cold drinks.\n\nK.K. Chockalingam, a consumer activist and trainer, spoke on the topic \u2018consumer rights\u2019 and how to take advantage of them.\n\nPalanisamy, District Revenue Officer; N.S. Balasubramaniam, District Supply; and Consumer Protection Officer, spoke.\n\nMr. Dakshinamoorthy declared open a mini exhibition and gave away prizes to the consumer clubs of schools and colleges for organising activities which created awareness on consumer rights among the common people.",
