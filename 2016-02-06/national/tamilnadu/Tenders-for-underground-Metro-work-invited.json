    "text": "Chennai Metro Rail has finally started the retendering process for the final stretch of the underground work that was abandoned by Gammon India last year.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they have now called for tenders for the second time for the construction of the line between Government Estate and AG-DMS stations. A few months ago, CMRL had invited bids for two stretches: between AG-DMS and Saidapet, and Government Estate and AG-DMS. While the contract was awarded for station building to L&T, officials decided to recall the tenders for the other stretch owing to some issues.\n\n\u201cL&T has started work and it is going on in full swing. By March, we hope to award the contract for this stretch as well,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe new contractor has to complete the tunnelling and construction work for this stretch between Government Estate and AG-DMS stations.\n\nThis is unlike the other stretch where Afcons Infrastructure Limited had finished the tunnelling work between AG-DMS and Saidapet and L&T had to construct the stations. In 2011, Gammon India and Russian firm Mosmetrostroy were awarded a contract by CMRL worth Rs. 1,947 crore for the design and construction of seven underground stations along Anna Salai. But early last year, the Russian firm left the project owing to fund crunch. CMRL terminated the contract of Gammon India for non-completion of work on time.",
