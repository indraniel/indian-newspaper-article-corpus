Commuters will also feel more secure and safe in stations. The number of shops will eventually increase in stations,\u201d an official said.\n\nBut commuters cannot bring in food items beyond the non-paid area, the official said.\n\n\u201cThey can carry packed items in their bags. But they cannot eat in the paid area or on board trains,\u201d he added.\n\nLakshmi Ram, a commuter, said such facilities made for better travel, atmosphere and safety.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the lessons MRTS has to learn; I dread travelling through MRTS stations like Indira Nagar after 7 p.m. because we feel so unsafe. Had there been a few shops and better atmosphere, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to travel. I travel by the Metro Rail now and it would be great if they added more such shops on this stretch, besides the ones that would come up soon,\u201d she added.\n\nGitakrishnan Ramadurai of IIT-Madras said commercial exploitation of space in a mass rapid transit also helped reduce the number of trips.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if a passenger uses the Metro Rail for getting home from his workplace, it will help if he finds a grocery store or an ATM or eatery in one of the stations.\n\nSuch an effort will urge people to use this mass rapid transit facility,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf shops are put up, we expect some increase in ridership. Commuters will also feel more secure,\u201dsay officials",
