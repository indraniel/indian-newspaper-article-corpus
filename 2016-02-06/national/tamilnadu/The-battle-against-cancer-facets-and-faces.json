The theme this year for World Cancer Day is \u2018We Can. I Can\u2019 to explore how everyone \u2013 collectives and individuals \u2013 can do their part to reduce the burden of cancer.\n\nAt Stella Maris College, the department of public relations conducted a cancer awareness campaign \u2018Sthree\u2019, in association with Global Hospitals. Students held events at women\u2019s colleges, campaigned at the trade fair on Island grounds and the college also hosted a cancer screening camp. Posters were displayed and presentations made on the myths surrounding cancer and the facts about the disease, said Keerthana Devabalan, a final-year student of the college.\n\nThe Department of Medical Oncology at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital also held an awareness event. Students of Loyola College performed a street demonstration and doctors from the department then interacted with members of the public explaining to them the importance of early detection, the availability of free treatment at all government hospitals and the necessity of completing treatment and regular follow-ups. Pamphlets were also distributed. \u201cQueries were also answered and we stressed that habits such as smoking and drinking should be avoided, diets must be healthy and residents should come in for regular screening,\u201d said K. Kalaichelvi, Head of the department.\n\nOne resident of Chennai donated his blood stem cells on Thursday. M. Haribabu, a resident of Old Washermanpet, who works with a BPO in Ambattur, underwent the procedure at Apollo Hospitals. His blood stem cells will be used to treat a patient from Kolkata, who has blood cancer, said Revathy Raj, paediatric haemato-oncologist at the hospital. DATRI, a blood stem cell registry, facilitated the donation.\n\n\u201cDATRI came to my company a few months ago and spoke to us about the importance of blood stem cell donation. I, along with some of my colleagues, registered. A few weeks ago, I got a call from them saying I was a match, and asking if I was ready to donate. I was,\u201d said the 28-year-old. After undergoing a number of tests and a series of injections to boost his stem cells production, Mr. Haribabu made the donation on Thursday. \u201cIt was completely painless \u2013 just like donating blood. It took two hours and 10 minutes. There was no disruption to my schedule at all,\u201d he said. Mr. Haribabu is back at work for a night shift on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf it was someone in my family, I would donate without even thinking about it. So why not for someone else, who can live if I help out,\u201d he asked.\n\nOther events scheduled in the city for Wednesday included a cancer awareness programme at Dr. MGR Janaki College, and an event by Unity of World Peace at Marina Beach.\n\nEvents, including seminars, were held in colleges, pamphlets were distributed",
