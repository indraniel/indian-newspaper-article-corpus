Devotees, who thronged the four rath streets and Palani Main Road, offered a huge quantum of flowers to the goddess. The flower offering ceremony began with special pujas and abishekam to the presiding deity. Later, the goddess ascended a florally-decorated rath. A temple elephant led the procession. Small raths carrying deities of Krishna, Vinayaka, Murugan, Lakshmi and Saraswathi were also drawn the holy procession.\n\nThe car procession started from the temple premises near Rock Fort and returned to the temple after passing through West Car Street, Vanivilasmedu, Dindigul-Palani highway, Gopal Samudram West Bank Road, and north, east and south car streets.
