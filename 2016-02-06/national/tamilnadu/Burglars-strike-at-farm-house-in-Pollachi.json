    "text": "Five masked burglars struck at a farm house in Pill Chinnampalayam village near Pollachi in the small hours of Friday and decamped with jewellery weighing nearly 15 sovereigns, a kg of silverware and Rs. 10,000.\n\nAccording to Coimbatore Rural Police sources, two of the five burglars broke the window of 79-year-old P.K. Paramasivan\u2019s house, accessed the door latch and entered the house where the elderly man and his wife, Krishnaveni, were fast asleep.\n\nThe house is in the midst of a 50-acre farm.\n\nOn hearing the noise of window getting smashed, when Mr. Paramasivan woke up to see what was happening, he encountered the two men in the drawing room of his house.\n\nHe tried to raise an alarm but the men hit his head with the wooden logs they carried.\n\nHis wife rushed to his help but the two burglars threatened her and snatched her gold chain, ear rings and other jewellery she was wearing.\n\nThey then entered the \u2018puja room\u2019 to lay their hands on the silverwares.\n\nThey also opened the safe to take away Rs. 10,000, said the police.\n\nAfter threatening the couple of dire consequences if they raised an alarm, the five consumed liquor and soon thereafter left the venue.\n\nAfter they left, Mr. Paramasivan rang up his son Sethu Sengaliappan for help. Mr. Sengaliappan is a member of a Hindu organisation.\n\nMr. Sengaliappan in turn informed the Pollachi Police who rushed to the spot. Senior police officers also visited the crime scene.",
