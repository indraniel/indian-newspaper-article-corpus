    "text": "Coimbatore Corporation on Thursday severed water supply connection to five persons in West Zone as they had failed to clear property tax dues.\n\nA release from the civic body said that even after repeated reminders, N.K. Ramasamy and Indumathi (two assessments) of Ward 11, M. Palanisamy of ward 16 and Muthusamy of Ward 23 had failed to pay property tax. Together, they owed the Corporation over Rs. 55,000 in property tax.\n\nTherefore, the Corporation had little choice but to severe the connection, said an officer.\n\nThe Corporation had been focussing on top five property tax defaulters in each of the five zones for action. Thus far it had severed around 25 water connections, he adds.\n\nAs of February 5, 2016, the property tax collection stood at Rs. 96 crore and the outstanding at Rs. 34.43 crore. The officer says that in the next few days the civic body will intensify its water disconnection drive as the last date for payment was October 15, 2015 for the second half-year.",
