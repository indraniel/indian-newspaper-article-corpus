Sriram inspected the High Court Bench campus on Friday and told The Hindu that it was only a preliminary inspection to appraise the Public Works Department officials of his requirements and additional civil works that need not be carried out. Asked as to when his men would take over the security of the High Court Bench from the local police, he said: \u201cThat will be decided by the Security Committee (comprising Justices R. Sudhakar, K.K. Sasidharan, N. Kirubakaran and G. Chockalingam) of the High Court.\u201d\n\nPublic Works Department Assistant Executive Engineer V. Sugumaran said that the CISF officials had sought for creation of many facilities, including a new road to be laid inside the campus, and hence a proposal had been sent to the State government seeking sanction for around Rs.42 lakh. \u201cOnce the sanction is granted, we are confident of completing the works within 45 days. Now, CISF officials want sheds to be put up outside the two sub entrances flanking the main entrance to the court buildings. We have to estimate the cost for these and send another proposal,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a High Court official said that the delay was basically owing to lack of funds to provide the various requirements of CISF which wanted to cordon off all four roads around the building housing the administrative block as well as court halls. \u201cThe CISF wants to lay two new pathways \u2014 one for the court staff to reach their vehicle parking bay after entering the campus and another for advocates to go to their chambers directly without driving or riding through the roads around the main court building as they were doing at present.\u201d \u201cWhile baggage scanners, metal detectors and other gadgets have been planned to be placed in the lobby succeeding the main entrance to the court buildings, the CISF wants sheds on the two additional entrances flanking the main entrance. All this requires huge amount of money,\u201d he said.",
