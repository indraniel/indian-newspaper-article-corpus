The challenge will be to reach the destination in two-and-a-half hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impractical as this is no race, but a rally. Only motorable roads have been chosen and the endeavour is to create awareness and draw women into driving,\u201d said Rati Dhandhania Mundrey, Chairperson, FICCI Ladies Organisation, which is hosting the event with Karnataka Motor Sports Club.\n\n\u201cWe are setting a platform for women to shed their inhibitions,\u201d she said.\n\nParticipants are allowed to bring in a navigator, but have to follow the Road Book issued by the Karnataka Motor Sports Club (KMSC). Specified routes and check points will be unveiled before the rally. According to the organisers, security is in place with rally permits from the police and ambulance accompanying them.\n\nThe rally will be flagged off at 9.45 a.m. on February 6 at Tata Motors Whitefield and will end at Hotel Royal Orchid in Devanahalli.\n\nThe response was phenomenal according to the organisers.",
