    "text": "Power generation in the first 1000 MW reactor of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) was suspended on Thursday night after it suffered a breakdown.\n\nThe generation came to a halt at 10.35 p.m. following a minor steam leak in the secondary line of the turbine, KKNPP sources told The Hindu on Friday. A team of experts is attending to the problem and power generation is expected to resume in a day or two.\n\nAfter a long gap, the first reactor commenced on January 30 generating 300 MW, which later went up to 730 MW. The generation was suspended for a planned shutdown on January 31, sources added.\n\nHowever, R.S. Mugilan, an anti-nuke activist, alleged that suspension of power generation in the first reactor was not a surprise since \u201call materials used in the nuclear power plant are of inferior quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, after synchronisation, commercial production could be achieved in a period of 60 days but for KKNPP it took one-and-a-half years. The steam boiler burst in May, 2014 and six persons were injured. But, the condition of the injured persons is not known,\u201d he charged.",
