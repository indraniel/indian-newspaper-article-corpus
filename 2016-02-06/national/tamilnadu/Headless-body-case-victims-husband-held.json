    "text": "The Chennai City Police has solved the case relating to the murder of a 27-year-old woman, whose torso was found near a garbage bin on Mount-Poonamallee Road in Ramapuram a month ago. The police have arrested the victim\u2019s husband and his accomplice.\n\nRecounting the gruesome crime, senior city police officials said Ramesh (33), the victim Sasirekha\u2019s husband, and his accomplice Lathika are reported to have murdered her in the first week of January and cut off her head.\n\nThey threw her head into a stormwater drain in Kolapakkam, while they disposed of the body near a dustbin in Ramapuram.\n\nSasirekha was Ramesh\u2019s second wife, police sources said, adding that he was also very close to Lathika.\n\nAll three of them were television serial actors. As she did not approve of Ramesh\u2019s friendship with Lathika, the two of them decided to do away with Sasirekha, the police said, adding that the murder took place on the evening of January 4.\n\nIt took them a while to establish her identity, police said. They sifted through the details of more than 100 women-missing cases registered in the city and suburbs before establishing Sasirekha\u2019s identity.\n\nPolice continue to search for the dead woman\u2019s head.\n\nThe suspects threw the victim\u2019s head into a drain and disposed of the body near a dustbin",
