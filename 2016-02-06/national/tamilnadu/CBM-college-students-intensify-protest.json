    "text": "Students of the CBM College of Arts and Science intensified their protest on Friday as the proposed tripartite talks involving them, the college faculty, and management representatives in the presence of Revenue Department and police officials did not take off.\n\nAccording to the students, just ahead of the meeting time, the Revenue Department officials called them to say that the talks would be held at the Perur Taluk Office and not at the college, as proposed. They did not want a change in venue, that too at the eleventh hour.\n\nSources among the faculty said that the students prevented them and also the principal in-charge from going to the taluk office and squatted in front of their vehicles. A few among the protesting students rushed to the terrace of the third floor threatening to commit suicide. A few students cut their wrists as well.\n\nBut with police help and the intervention of a few senior students, the students were brought down from the terrace and those who had cut their wrists were provided first aid.\n\nThe students said that they wanted the College Secretary to visit the college, participate in the talks and the officials to inspect the facilities available to understand the cause of their protest. Their only demand was for the State Government to take over their institution and they stood by the demand.\n\nOfficials in the Collegiate Education department were unavailable for comments.\n\nThe police sources said that they had suggested holding the meeting on February 8 at the taluk office as the Secretary was reluctant to participate in the talks in the college, given his experience during the last talks.\n\nThe students had gheraoed the Secretary who was forced to spend the night in the institution. The boys and girls relented only after he fainted due to ill-health.",
