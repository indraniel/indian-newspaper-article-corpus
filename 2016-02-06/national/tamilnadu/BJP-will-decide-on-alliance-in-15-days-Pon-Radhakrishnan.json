    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party would take a decision on alliance for the forthcoming Assembly election in another 10 to 15 days, Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan said here on Friday.\n\nAddressing reporters after inspecting the progress of the Suchindram bridge across the Pazhayar, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the decision on alliance would be announced by the party high command. The Congress remained isolated in Tamil Nadu as no party was ready to have an alliance with it, he said.\n\nThe visit of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Sri Lanka would facilitate the return of fishermen languishing in various prisons in Sri Lanka and seized fishing boats.\n\nThe Centre was taking serious efforts to rescue 49 fishermen from Kanyakumari district stranded in Iran, he added.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s recent visit to Tamil Nadu was a big boost to the party. In his speech, Mr. Modi had clearly explained the strategies of the government for development, he said.\n\nWhen asked about the Colachel port project, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that it would not affect the livelihood of fishermen but would help in overall development of the region.",
