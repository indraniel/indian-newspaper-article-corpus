    "text": "Several buses and a special train brought back passengers to Bengaluru while the line clearing work began. Passengers who traveled in 7 buses to the city were dropped off at various points before the buses made their way to the City railway station. This came as a surprise to Railways staff who had arranged for food packets for the arriving passengers. \u201cSome buses came empty as the driver had dropped off the passengers at places like Town Hall and the bus station as they said that they had work to attend to,\u201d an official manning the help-desk at the station said. Undamaged coaches of the derailed train were also shunted back to Bengaluru by afternoon.\n\n\u201cTrains will begin running normally by Saturday morning. We will investigate further,\u201d said Divisional Railway Manager, Bangalore, Sanjiv Agarwal, who reached the spot to co-ordinate rescue and restoration operations.",
