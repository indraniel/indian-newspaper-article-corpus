    "text": "The officials of the Public Works Department have inspected a few water bodies in Petthanayakkanpalayam and Vazhappadi blocks and have written to the revenue authorities for removal of encroachments.\n\nThe spacious Periyeri Lake in the tail-end of River Vasishta continues to remain dry. The water holding area has also shrunk to a big extent due to encroachments. The presence of seemai karuvelam trees in abundance in the tank bed is another problem confronting the PWD authorities and the farmers alike.\n\nP. R. Samikannu, a farmer of Periyeri village, urged the PWD and revenue department to take steps for retrieving the original water holding area of the lake.\n\nThe Manivizhunthan Lake is another water body in Attur block which has badly lost its shape due to illegal encroachments.\n\nThe PWD authorities when contacted said that the Department had conducted survey of a few lakes including Periyeri Lake for identification of encroachments. The department has written to the Revenue people for the removal of the same.\n\nMeanwhile, the District Collector V. Sampath also favoured similar survey for the identification of the encroachments in the other water bodies too and directed the PWD and Revenue officials to issue notice to all those who had illegally encroached into the canals, tanks and lakes.",
