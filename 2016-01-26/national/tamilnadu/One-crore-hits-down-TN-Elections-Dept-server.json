    "text": "After publishing the electoral rolls on January 20, the Chief Electoral Officer, Tamil Nadu, encouraged the voters to check their names and other details online. What he did not expect was the crashing of server.\n\nBombarded with more than one crore hits over the past five days, the TN Elections Department\u2019s server functioning from Ahmedabad in Gujarat almost crashed.\n\n\u201cWithin five days since the release of the rolls on January 20, we have seen more than a crore hits in our server. It almost crashed and was down for half-a-day. We wrote to the BSNL to double the capacity with one more server. Now, it is functioning,\u201d Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. on Monday, the average hits per minute were 450 and over 7,500 persons had used system in just half an hour cramming the servers. On Monday alone, the server received over 4.5 lakh hits.\n\n\u201cThough we are happy with the response we also doubt whether auto checking programmes are being used to check their names by voters. Anyway, increasing the capacity of the server is the solution for this issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 18 per cent to 20 per cent of the hits were from mobile phones and the remaining was from either laptops or desktops.\n\nThe software used by the CEO\u2019s office also shows that names in the electoral roll being checked are that of persons who are between 18 and 27 years.",
