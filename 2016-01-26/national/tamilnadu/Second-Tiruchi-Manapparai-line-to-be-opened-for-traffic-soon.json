This is part of the Villuppuram-Madurai doubling project.\n\nThe work, executed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, between Manaparai and Dindigul is in an advance stage and is likely to be completed by August. Once the entire stretch of doubling work is completed, the travel time of express trains would come down.\n\nFor instance, Pandiyan Express would take a little over seven hours, instead of the nine hours it takes now between Chennai Egmore and Madurai.\n\nDisclosing that RVNL General Manager had a discussion with him last week about the doubling of Madurai-Tirunelveli-Nagercoil and Vanchi Maniyachi-Tuticorin sections, Mr. Garg said the work may be taken up soon.\n\nUnion Railway Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had announced the project of doubling the remaining the line in Tamil Nadu (connecting Chennai with Nagercoil) through extra budgetary resources during the Railway Budget, 2016.\n\nUnder the project the railway officials have decided to provide two main lines and two loop lines in each railway station in the section. \u201cThis would help smoother running of trains in opposite directions without having to wait for crossings,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, the safety aspect would in Madurai-Tirunelveli section would also be significantly improved with elimination of 73 level crossings under the project, expected to be completed within four years.\n\nThe level crossings would be replaced either with sub-ways or with road overbridges, he said.",
