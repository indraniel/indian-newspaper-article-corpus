Periasamy\n\nResidents of Pudhu Muthu Nagar at Thudiyalur, on Monday petitioned the district administration seeking power connection for 70 residents.\n\nThe residents said that they had been living for the past 30 years and 22 of those with pucca houses. But they have not got power connection to date. This had affected them, more particularly the school and college students. A few among them had discontinued studies.\n\nTherefore, the district administration should provide power connection, they said.\n\nIn another petition to the district administration, residents of Cheripalayam hamlet in Andipalayam panchayat led by AIDWA members demanded removal of Tasmac-run liquor outlet.\n\nThe petitioners said that for long they had been demanding the closure or shifting of shop no. 2276 but to no avail. The Tasmac managers in the district promised to shift the shop by August 2015 but failed to keep up their assurance.\n\nThe residents also sought early disbursement of money to those who took up toilet construction under a government programme.",
