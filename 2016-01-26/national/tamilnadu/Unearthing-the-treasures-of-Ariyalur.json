    "text": "There is now a general agreement among geologists that the areas now called Ariyalur and Perambalur was under the sea 65 to 145 million years ago. This fact is reflected in the huge amount of marine fossils identified in the districts.\n\nFascinated by these fossil deposits, two amateur palaeontologists \u2014 Nirmal Rajah and Anurag Amin, working in Dubai, decided to pay a visit to Ariyalur and their explorations have been filmed into a documentary titled \u2018Unearthing the treasures of Ariyalur\u2019.\n\nVaishnavi Sundar of Lime Soda Films, the maker of the documentary, says that the idea behind the film was to inspire children to take up geology and palaeontology.\n\nMs. Vaishnavi says while the \u201cfossil treasure\u201d of Ariyalur is surprisingly well known outside India, there was little awareness about this geologically unique place domestically. \u201cAbroad, a place like this would have been converted into a great tourist attraction,\u201d she feels. Adding to this was the fact that the lime deposits seem to be heavily exploited by local cement factories.\n\nThe film has been done under the banner of Nirmukta, a freethinkers group with presence across India. It will be released on Tuesday.",
