The government should order a judicial probe into the death of the students and provide adequate compensation to their families. The government should also transfer students studying in the college to other institutions, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, senior police officials convinced parents who refused to accept the bodies of girls of a fair investigation.\n\nThe post-mortem of Saranya and Priyanka was conducted on Sunday evening and the bodies were handed over to the families. However, parents of Monisha from Chennai stood their ground and refused to accept the body after the post-mortem on Monday.\n\n\u2018Government should order a judicial probe into the death of the students\u2019",
