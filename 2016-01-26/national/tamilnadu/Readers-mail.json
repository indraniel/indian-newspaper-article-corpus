    "text": "Operate additional bus service\n\nPrivate buses plying between Thanjavur New Bus Stand and Tiruchi do not stop at SASTRA University during morning hours. Students or their parents going to the university depend on TNSTC buses resulting in overcrowding and causing inconvenience.\n\nThe Transport Department should operate additional buses on this route.\n\nG. Sathyanarayanan Iyer,\n\nThanjavur.\n\nEnsure smooth\n\nflow of traffic\n\nA college, school, museum, darbar hall, Saraswati Mahal Library, fire service and police station are situated in Thanjavur palace complex apart from passage to Sarafoji vegetable market at East Main Street. This street is quite busy due to a large number of vegetable vendors, public, tourists and students from dawn to dusk.\n\nTo ensure safety, speed breaker on either side of the road to the entrance of the palace complex should be set up.\n\nIt will ensure smooth flow of traffic and avoid accidents.\n\nN. Natarajan,\n\nThanjavur.\n\nRegulate parking\n\nIn Kumbakonam, there is a long road from high school to Saraswathy Padasala Girls school.\n\nEven though this road is narrow one, there are LED lamp posts. Parking of two-wheelers on this segment should be regulated and organised to avoid congestion.\n\nA road in front of Vijayalakshmi Theatre should be re-laid.\n\nS.Krishnan,\n\nThippirajapuram.\n\nNeed to repair\n\nbad roads\n\nThe new road laid recently in the Kumbakonam-Sakkottai area has uncovered pits of manholes which are about four inches in depth.\n\nThis is hazardous for two-wheelers. Authorities should take some corrective measures immediately.\n\nH. Sheik Abdul Kadhar,\n\nNachiarkoil.",
