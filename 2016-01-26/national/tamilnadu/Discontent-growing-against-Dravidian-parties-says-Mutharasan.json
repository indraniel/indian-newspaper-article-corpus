    "text": "People will throw out the AIADMK and the DMK in the forthcoming Assembly elections as they did to the Congress in the 1967 Assembly election and elected DMK alliance led by C.N. Annadurai. Discontent and dissatisfaction against the Dravidian parties was spreading rapidly, said CPI State Secretary R. Mutharasan.\n\nTalking to The Hindu here on Monday, he said that the Dravidian parties came to power on the basis of discontent only. In 1967, people were disgusted against the Congress-led government.\n\n\u201cThe political situation which was prevailing in 1967 is back in the State now. Discontent against the DMK and the AIADMK is high as all sections of people were affected,\u201d he added.\n\nStating that the People\u2019s Welfare Front was intact, Mr. Mutharasan said that alliance would continue after even after the Assembly elections. The PWF was a five-month-old baby and some parties tried to strangulate it. They have been using visual and print media to make false propaganda against the front in order to disintegrate it. The PWF was the only alliance formed on the basis of policies and common minimum programme. All the previous electoral alliances among political parties in the State were based on seat-sharing, he pointed out.\n\nMr. Mutharasan condemned the death of three college girls in Villupuram district and blamed the government for not initiating stern action against the college management and educational institutions that did not follow government norms.",
