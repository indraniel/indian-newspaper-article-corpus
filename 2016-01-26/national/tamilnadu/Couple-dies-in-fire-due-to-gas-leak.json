    "text": "Leaking gas comes into contact with sparks from switch board where a charger was kept plugged\n\nIn a fire accident caused by a gas leak, two members of a family in B.V. Nagar, Vyasarpadi, died on Monday morning.\n\nPolice sources identified the deceased as M. Rajendran, 57, who was employed as a security guard, and his wife Rani, 49, a homemaker. The couple\u2019s son, Dinesh, sustained severe burns.\n\nCylinder not turned off\n\nThe investigating policemen said the leaking gas came into contact with sparks from a switch board where a cell phone charger had been kept plugged, which resulted in a fire. The cylinder had not been turned off on Sunday night, they said.\n\nThe fire spread quickly and engulfed the house. Noticing smoke billowing from the house, neighbours called the fire control room and also informed the M.K.B. Nagar police station.\n\nFire and Rescue Services personnel and police managed to break into the house.\n\nThe three persons, who had lost consciousness, were moved to a hospital nearby. While Rajendran died soon after he was shifted to the hospital, Rani succumbed to her injuries later in the evening. Dinesh continues to receive treatment, police said.\n\nSimilar incident\n\nOnly on January 18, three men were injured in Villivakkam following a similar accident caused by gas leakage.\n\nNagaraj, along with his friends Srinivasan and Babu, sustained burns after he failed to turn off the gas supply in his house at Barathi Nagar 2nd Street, Villivakkam. The next morning, when Nagaraj switched on the light, the gas-filled room was engulfed in a fire, leaving the three persons seriously injured.\n\nTheir son, Dinesh, sustains severe burns and is undergoing treatment",
