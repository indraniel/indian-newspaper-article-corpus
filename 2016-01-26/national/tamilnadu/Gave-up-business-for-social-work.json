    "text": "D.K. Srinivasan, an octogenarian, has been involved in social service for more than three decades. A successful businessman, he gave it up to start the Hindu Mission Hospital, Tambaram as its honorary founder secretary, which serves thousands of poor people from the city\u2019s southern suburbs and even beyond. Mr. Srinivasan said it was a recognition for his work in the fields of medicine and education, which he attributed to teamwork. A desire to improve the quality of lives of less-fortunate in society motivated him to take a plunge into social work. He attributes his success to his wife Hema, their sons and daughters-in-law.\n\n- T. Madhavan",
