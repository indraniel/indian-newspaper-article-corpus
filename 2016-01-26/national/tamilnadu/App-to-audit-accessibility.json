    "text": "To find out if the polling stations for the upcoming State elections are accessible to those with disabilities, the Disability Rights Alliance, Tamil Nadu (DRA) has developed an app that volunteers can use to audit the stations.\n\nThe app, to be called \u2018Election Audit\u2019, has been developed by software company Ardhika, and will be available on the Android platform, but can only be used by registered volunteers, said Sathya Madurantakam of DRA.\n\n\u201cWe have to ensure the information we gather is authentic, and we are planning to give volunteers an orientation on how to use the app,\u201d he said.\n\nA series of questions forms the basis of the app, said Smitha Sadasivan, a member of the DRA. \u201cEach question has features listed under it \u2013 whether the road the polling station is on, is accessible, has lighting, ramps, toilets, seating areas, hand rail and grab bars, space for wheelchairs etc. If a particular feature is missing at the station, the volunteer can take a photograph and attach it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to perhaps link it with the server at the office of the chief electoral officer. If this does not happen, we will deploy it on our server, gather the data and then give it to the CEO\u2019s office,\u201d said Mr. Madurantakam.",
