    "text": "Principal District Judge R. Poornima on Monday adjourned the pujari suicide case to February 9 as the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court reserved its judgment in the case seeking appointment of a lawyer instead of special public prosecutor to argue the case in the Dindigul court.\n\nManimaran, one of the seven accused, appeared before the court for hearing.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel informed the judge that the HC did not pronounce the judgment on the appointment of lawyer. Defense Counsel S. Kannappan submitted petitions on behalf O. Raja, prime accused in the case, and others. Lawyers hoped that the High Court would pronounce its judgment before the next hearing. The police registered cases against Mr. Raja, brother of Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam, and six others \u2013 Thenkarai town panchayat chairman Pandi, Manimaran, Loganathan, Sivakumar, Gnanam and Saravanan \u2013 in connection with the suicide of S. Nagamuthu (22) of T. Kallupatti, a Dalit.\n\nNagamuthu, who was a pujari at Sri Kailasanathar Hill Temple near Periyakulam, committed suicide by hanging on December 8, 2012, after he was allegedly subjected to harassment. Charges were framed against the seven accused recently.\n\nInitially, Thenkarai police filed a suicide case under 174 Cr. PC and later altered it to 306-A IPC as per the direction of the High Court Bench. Unconditional bail was already granted to Mr. Raja.",
