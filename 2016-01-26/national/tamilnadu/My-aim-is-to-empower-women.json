Wherever I go, I tell them that I am not here to sell machinery but to create a social change by empowering women. I hope to inspire more youngsters to take the technical platform and become social entrepreneurs,\u201d he said. In the last ten years, the social entrepreneur has installed 2,460 machines across the country and 17 other nations.\n\n- M. Soundarya Preetha",
