Gopalakrishna Endowment Oration on \u2018Holistic and Integrative Medicine: The Medical Approach for the Future,\u2019 Dr. Mathai said, \u201cUnfortunately, the western medical concept mostly treats a person like a consumer and sells the service. You can generate money. You should see how ancient China worked. There, the doctors who treated fewer patients were paid more,\u201d Dr. Mathai said.\n\nHe said that according to World Health Organisation, 80 per cent of the world population was still dependent on traditional medicine. \u201cBreathing is one of the most important tools for improvement of health. It has been scientifically proven now that breathing tools have a positive impact on the brain,\u201d he added.\n\nR. Seshasayee of Infosys said Mr. Gopalakrishna had faced several challenges during his time with regard to the industry.\n\n\u201cStarting something then was very difficult, from getting an approval from the Central government to licenses. In every way, he swam against the current with determination and courage,\u201d he said.",
