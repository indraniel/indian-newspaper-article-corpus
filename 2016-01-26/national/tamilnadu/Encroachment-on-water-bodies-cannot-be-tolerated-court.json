    "text": "Stating that encroachment in water bodies cannot be tolerated, specifically in view of a Full Bench decision, the Madras High Court on Monday directed the Collector of Erode district to take immediate steps to remove encroachments in and around canals branching out from Perumpallam dam of Surampatti village in the district.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana passed the order on a PIL moved by T. Ravichandran seeking a direction to remove the encroachments in the canal of Perumpallam dam and the surrounding areas of the dam.\n\nIn its counter affidavit, the district administration submitted that out of 589 encroachers, already 17 have vacated and 572 have refused to vacate despite sending notices sent in 2012. The authorities sought time to relocate the remaining encroachers and submitted that the encroachments were only on the banks of the canal, not affecting the free flow of water.\n\nRefusing to accept their contentions, the Bench said, \u201cAction should be immediately taken in pursuance to the encroachment removal notices.\n\nEncroachment in water area can\u2019t be tolerated specifically in view of the Full Bench decision of this court.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of taking action promptly, a long drawn out plan is sought to be envisaged affecting the very removal of these encroachments.\n\nIn fact it is stated that there is no sufficient vacant land available in Erode district and thus housing in the form of dwelling apartments has to be given.\n\nThese dwelling apartments are still at the drawing board stage. We are unable to accept the explanation and the time plan submitted by the authorities,\" the Bench said.",
