This mobile toilet facility is now being put to use in crowded places such as exhibitions.\n\nPresently, the mobile toilet has been stationed near the Collector\u2019s office due to the huge inflow of persons, especially women, for the ongoing interviews for the job of noon meal organisers.\n\nIt is also being stationed at the ongoing government exhibition on Fort Ground in the evening.\n\n\u201cWe remodelled a mini-lorry used in garbage collection into a mobile toilet for the use of vendors in Mandy Street nearly a month ago. They were facing difficulty due to absence of toilet facility in the area. Constructing a toilet here will be a hard task for want of space,\u201d said Janaki Raveendran, commissioner, Vellore Corporation.\n\nThe vehicle consists of three toilets for women and one toilet, three urinals for men. It has an attached tank filled with water.\n\n\u201cThe waste water gets collected and is let out at the underground drainage pumping station,\u201d she said. The Corporation is looking at the response from the public to come up with more such mobile toilets.",
