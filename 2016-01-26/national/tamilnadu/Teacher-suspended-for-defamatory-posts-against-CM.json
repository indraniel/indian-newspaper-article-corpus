    "text": "A teacher of government primary school was suspended for defamatory posts on Facebook against the Chief Minister and local officials here. The action was taken by the District Elementary Education Officer Rajashekar on the recommendation of the Chief Education Officer K.P. Maheshwari here on Friday.\n\nThe teacher, Moorthy, of Mulluvaady Government Primary School in Pennagaram, had posted a snap shot of an alleged interview of the 1980s, purportedly given by Ms. Jayalalithaa to a Tamil magazine, on his FB page.\n\nHe also posted allegations against Chief Education Officer and Collector. \u201cThe posts are in total violation of conduct rules of government employees who have no right to criticise the government,\u201d CEO Maheshwari told The Hindu . \u201cMoreover, Government school teachers are also entrusted with election duty. Teachers are expected to be role models for children,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nAccording to Ms. Maheshwari, all posts were made during working hours and had triggered unnecessary gossip, making it difficult for higher officials to perform their duties. The recommendation for disciplinary action and the suspension was made under Section 17 E of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants Conduct Rules.",
