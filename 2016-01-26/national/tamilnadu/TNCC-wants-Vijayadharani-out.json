    "text": "Citing alleged \u201canti-party activities\u201d, the TNCC has apparently urged the Congress high command to take disciplinary action against MLA S. Vijayadharani.\n\nSources in the Congress said following her removal from the post of State Mahila Congress president, Ms. Vijayadharani had given multiple interviews to the media questioning the decision of party vice president Rahul Gandhi. \u201cShe has also accused the Congress of being \u201canti-women\u201d. A detailed report, collating all the press interviews, had been sent to the Central leadership,\u201d a senior leader said. The report has also cited the \u201csudden\u201d pro-AIADMK stand that Ms. Vijayadharani has taken by airing views in support of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa when the TNCC was actively campaigning against the \u201cfailures\u201d of the State government.\n\n\u201cThe TNCC has taken the position that her continuation in the party is no longer tenable,\u201d the leader said, requesting anonymity.\n\nHowever, Ms. Vijayadharani maintained that she met Ms. Jayalalithaa in the Tamil Nadu Assembly to submit a file with her views regarding a government project.\n\n\u201cI am waiting to meet Mr. Rahul Gandhi to explain my position. Talking against E.V.K.S. Elangovan and his manner of functioning is not anti-party activity,\u201d she said.",
