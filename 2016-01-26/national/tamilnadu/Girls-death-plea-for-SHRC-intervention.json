    "text": "Madurai-based non-governmental organisation, People\u2019s Watch, has demanded the immediate intervention of the Chairperson of State Human Rights Commission in the recent death of three girls who were studying second year in SVS College of Naturopathy and Yoga Science at Bangaram in Villupuram.\n\nThe organisation had urged that SHRC should ensure that all the students of the college were transferred to other medical colleges in the State free of cost. Alleging that the death was the result of wilful negligence by officials who failed to take action against the college for various violations, People\u2019s Watch had also demanded the immediate suspension of all those authorities who were approached by students highlighting the issues plaguing the college.\n\nIt had also urged the Tamil Nadu government to fill up all the vacancies in colleges at least now. The organisation called for the government, particularly officials from police and higher education departments, to treat students\u2019 unions with dignity as they were the ones who brought out issues and fought for democratisation of educational institutions.",
