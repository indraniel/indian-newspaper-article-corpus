Vijaya Bhaskar said the headquarter hospital was the first GH in the State to have such facility. Earlier, it was set up only in the GHs that were attached to medical colleges.\n\nThe bank has Rs.5 lakh worth of equipment to process and preserve milk. With an effective implementation of mother and childcare schemes, Tamil Nadu stood second in the country in low child mortality rate.\n\nAlready, mother's milk banks were established at Tiruchi GH, Theni Government Medical College Hospital, Salem Mohan Kumaramangalam GH, Thanjavur Raja Mirasdhar GH and Egmore childcare hospital.\n\nJoint Director of Health Services M. Ravi Kala said that this facility would cater to the milk needs of newborns who were unable to get mothers\u2019 milk due to various reasons. Sometimes, mothers could not have sufficient milk to feed newborns. Abandoned children, babies who lost their mothers and babies of sick mothers would also benefit.",
