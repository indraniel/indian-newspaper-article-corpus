While the number of children \u2014 1,250 seems to be high compared to the previous years \u2014 412 in 2013 and over 300 the following year, officials said documentation of such children who had either run away or lost their way had increased and hence the steep figure. Of this, over 30 per cent were from States outside Tamil Nadu.\n\nOfficials said that interaction with such young boys and girls revealed that a number of factors drove them from their homes to far-off destinations. \u201cPoverty drives many children out of their homes. Some of them leave after being scolded by their relatives or by teachers for not completing their homework, some others leave for trivial reasons,\u201d said an officer.\n\nHowever, they have also stepped up efforts to unite the children with their parents and in the worst case of being unable to do so, they will hand the children over to the local child welfare committee. As part of Operation Smile \u2014 an initiative to trace missing young boys and girls or unite runway children with their parents \u2014 199 of them were taken back to their homes, while the remaining were handed over to government shelters or private welfare homes authorised by the government. Some of the boys who were rescued were in conflict with the law, officials said.\n\nThey had appointed Child Welfare Officers in 25 railway police stations in Chennai region that include Vellore, Salem and Coimbatore districts.",
