    "text": "Velachery might have emerged as an important terminal on the railway map of the city, but several hundred commuters find it extremely difficult to have quick and easy access to the station.\n\nNot just commuters who reach the Velachery station to board the MRTS trains, but motorists passing using the service road to reach Inner Ring Road also complain that the road width has been reducing. The absence of a pavement makes it risky for pedestrians to walk on the stretch, they say, adding that the problem is due to encroachments by hawkers and commercial establishments.\n\nWith several commercial establishments coming up along the service road, visitors to these shops rob space for pedestrians. Makeshift shops too eat into the road space, residents complain.\n\nS. Harishkumar, of Ram Nagar third Main Road in Velachery, said with the service road being narrow, pedestrians were exposed to risks. Traffic police were coming up very little initiatives other than placing temporary barricades. The service road should be widened and pavements created for pedestrians, he added.",
