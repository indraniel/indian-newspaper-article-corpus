    "text": "On seeing 103 years mentioned against a name in the draft rolls during an inspection in Antiyur Taluk on Monday, District Collector S. Prabakar altered his itinerary and went straight to the house of the oldest voter in the district. T. Rathnasamy, who, according to his family members, has been exercising his franchise without fail, was honoured with a shawl by the surprise visitor, much to the delight of his family members.\n\nMr. Rathnasamy who had lost his hearing capacity was, however, brisk enough to walk by himself.\n\nHe is the only voter in the taluk aged over 100, said Anthiyur tahsildar P. Boopathy. The voter identity card states that Rathasamy was born in 1912, and wife in 1939.",
