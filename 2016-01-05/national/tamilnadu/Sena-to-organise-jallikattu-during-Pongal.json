    "text": "Shiva Sena district president K. V. Saravanan said that Sena members would organise jallikattu and rekla race during Pongal if the government machinery did not take steps to lift the ban before that.\n\nHe told this soon after giving a memorandum to Collector G. Govindaraj on Monday highlighting the need to lift ban on jallikattu and other traditional sporting events involving animals and fowls.\n\nThe Sena members came to the Collectorate with cattle and country fowls.\n\nMr. Saravanan pointed out that a sporting event such as jallikattu was embedded in the Tamil culture and hence, the ban should be lifted by making certain amendments in the existing legislation.",
