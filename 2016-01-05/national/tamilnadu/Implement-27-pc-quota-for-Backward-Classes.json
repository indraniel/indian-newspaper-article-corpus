    "text": "Seeking implementation of 27 per cent reservation for persons from Backward communities in Central Government offices, members of the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) picketed the BSNL office, near the Collectorate, here on Monday.\n\nState general secretary of the organisation Ku. Ramakrishnan said that in 1990, the then Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced that 27 per cent reservation would be set aside for persons from Backward communities. \u201cBut the order is in existence only in paper,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ramakrishnan claimed that less than 12 per cent of persons from the communities were employed in the Central Government offices. \u201cOf the total of 79,483 personnel in the A, B, C and D categories in Central Government departments, only 9,040 are from Backward communities,\u201d he added.\n\nStating that none from the communities were employed in the President\u2019s office, he claimed that the percentage of staff in the higher education sector was less than six per cent. The kazhagam would be organising more protests if the Centre failed to implement the reservation.\n\nOver 40 TPDK personnel, who picketed the BSNL office, were arrested by the Race Course police and released later that day.",
