Abdul Kalam\u2019s Wings of Fire . \u201cMahatma Gandhi\u2019s words \u2018Be the change you wish to see in world\u2019 always inspired me. I wanted to inculcate reading habits in younger generation, and a passion towards knowledge,\u201d signs Prasanna, and the interpreter communicates it.\n\nFriendship is about love and camaraderie on campus, with subtle commentary on class discrimination.\n\nThere were 1,000 participants from across the country. The films from Kerala were especially moving. It felt great to be one of the participants, representing Coimbatore, says Madhan.\n\n\u201cWe felt honoured to receive the awards competing with best of filmmakers. The competition was tough, but it helped us gain confidence to face a bigger challenge.\u201d\n\nMadhan is an employee at AutoCAD and Prasanna is an artist. But, both are passionate about movies. Madhan is a self-taught video editor too.\n\nPrasanna says that this was their debut film and that he was astonished at the results.\n\nHe sees movies as a powerful tool that can bring about a change in the sensibilities of society.\n\n\u201cThe audience learns new ideas and easily gets influenced by visuals. Our aim is to create awareness, and to prove that the differently abled too can produce great movies.\u201d",
