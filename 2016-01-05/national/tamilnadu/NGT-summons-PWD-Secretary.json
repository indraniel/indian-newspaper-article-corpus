Jyothimani and expert member R. Nagendran directed the officers to appear in their chamber on January 8.\n\nThe Chennai Corporation had earlier stated that it identified over 1,000 illegal sewers spilling into the canal and had blocked them. A joint committee involving Metro Water and Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board was set up to deal with the issue.\n\nThe petitioner had alleged that due to the unmonitored flow of toxic effluents into it, the canal posed health hazard to the public and sought for direction to de-silt the entire canal, stop illegal effluents and plug them.",
