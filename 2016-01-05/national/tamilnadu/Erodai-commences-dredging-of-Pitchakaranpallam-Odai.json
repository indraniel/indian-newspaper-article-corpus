Erodai and five other organisations UNWO - Masjid Sevai Kuzhu, Erode Spice Round Table - 211, Youth Christian Commitment, Erode Siragugal and Selva Charitable Trust that are together implementing the task, have taken on board industries also to ensure their fullest cooperation.\n\nErodai, said its Project Director Sudhakar, the managing director of Sudha Institute of Medical Sciences, will be getting water samples from the two canals tested on a periodic basis to detect presence of untreated effluent, in order to prevent the rate of spread of cancer and other serious ailments.",
