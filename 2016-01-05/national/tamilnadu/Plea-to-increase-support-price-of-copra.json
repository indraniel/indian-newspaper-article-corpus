    "text": "Coconut farmers are keenly looking for government intervention to get the support price for copra increased as the diminishing market prices pose a severe threat to the profit margins.\n\nRaising the matter at the grievances redress meeting organised by the district administration for farmers here, C. Manoharan, the district secretary of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, said that the market price for copra had come down from Rs. 110 a kg to almost Rs. 56 a kg in the last one year.\n\n\u201cHoarding by traders and import of palm oil in large quantities can be cited as some of the reasons for the fall in prices,\u201d he said.\n\nK.C.M. Balasubramanian, another farmer, said that apart from increasing the support prices, steps should be taken to distribute coconut oil through public distribution system so as to boost up the demand for coconut.\n\nThe farmers who attended the meeting requested the District Collector to allot a bus stop in front of the new Collectorate building to provide an easy access.\n\nEarlier, Collector G. Govindaraj distributed modern tractors and rotavators to 10 farmers at subsidised rates in an attempt to enthuse them to use latest technologies.",
