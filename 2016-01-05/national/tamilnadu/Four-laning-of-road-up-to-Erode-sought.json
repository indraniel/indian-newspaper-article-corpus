    "text": "The trade and industry sector here desires extension of the proposed four-laning from Namakkal to Tiruchengode up to Erode.\n\nAccording to representatives of trade organisations, the density of vehicular traffic is more between Tiruchengode and Erode when compared to Namakkal - Tiruchengode stretch.\n\nA second bridge across Cauvery river connecting Karunkalpalayam on the side of Erode district with Pallipalayam town in Namakkal district is expected to enable hassle-free movement of vehicles. But, crossing the congested Pallipalayam town is a major hurdle. There are several thousands of employees of government and private organisations commuting every day to work between Erode and Namakkal districts, according to Ramasamy of Karunkalpalayam who travels from Erode every day to Namakkal for work.\n\nAccording to sources in the Highways Department, the widening of a part of the stretch is likely in the coming years.\n\nA Detailed Project Report is under preparation to study the scope for widening of a little over 20-km stretch between Thokkavady and Pallipalayam. The DPR will encompass economic analysis, environmental and social assessments of project-affected people, and social and environmental action plans as per the World Bank appraisal requirements, it is learnt.\n\nThe four-laned road is expected to be of 30-metre breadth encompassing 20-metre road surface, median, and paved shoulders and drainage. Once the DPR is completed, the State Government will decide on funding. The sanction is most likely during the current year, sources said.",
