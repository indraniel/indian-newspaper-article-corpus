Madeswaran said that there are six railway tracks with three platforms in the station and passengers board and align from trains in the station.\n\nHowever, due to absence of reservation centre, passengers have to either go to Mettur or Salem to reserve their tickets. \u201cThis poses hardship for passengers as they have to spent time and money.\u201d\n\nHe urged the committee to pass a resolution demanding reservation centre at Omalur Railway Station.\n\nMr. Madeswaran also said that water was drawn from overhead tanks in Chikkampatty panchayat in Omalur taluk by realtors without obtaining permission from the panchayat.\n\nHe warned that water shortage will happen if the situation continues and demanded action against the realtors.\n\nCommittee Chairman Sathish Kumar said that a resolution would be passed and sent to the Railway authorities for necessary action.\n\nEarlier, when the meeting began AIADMK councillor of Mecheri block Ayyandurai said that he has 3.55 acres of land at Thippampatti in Konur panchayat.
