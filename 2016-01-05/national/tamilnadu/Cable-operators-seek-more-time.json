Saleem, president of Puducherry Cable TV Operators Association said that operators were trying to speed up the process but attributed the delay due to practical difficulties in the wake of the recent incessant rains and subsequent flooding.\n\n\u201cAround 20 per cent of connections in the city have switched over from analog to digital transmission and three months more time is required for all connections to switch over to the digital system. There are only two to three players supplying STBs in the country and there is a huge demand,\u201d Mr. Saleem added.\n\nPuducherry falls under the third phase of digitisation and around 5 crore STBs are in demand in the country for the third phase alone. We have already placed orders and the STBs are likely to be shipped in a week\u2019s time.\n\nThe switch from analogue to digital will include the introduction of the Conditional Access System (CAS) by which customers can choose the television channels they want. We have requested the administration to extend the deadline by three more months, said Mr. Saleem.\n\nHowever, cable operators are unlikely to cut off signals. Multi System Operators have been asking the local Cable Television operators to urge consumers to install STBs. Several states have already approached the court seeking extension of the deadline, a cable operator said.",
