    "text": "Owing to sudden spurt in the arrival\n\nWith a sudden spurt in the arrival of small onion (shallots) from major production centres within the district, its price crashed in the wholesale onion market here on Monday.\n\nTraders struggled to sell new onions that were damp even for Rs.8 a kg. Price of onion was hovering between Rs.30 and Rs.40 a kg last week, owing to slump in arrival and availability of limited stock of old onions. (Onion prices touched Rs.100 a kg a few months back owing to poor arrival. The market had received around 1,200 bags only.) The market received 4,500 bags from Iyyalur, Eriyode, Vadamadurai and Gujiliamparai on Monday morning. Recently, harvested onions were in damp condition. Shelf life was very less and these shallots would perish quickly, opined a wholesale trader S. Marimuthu.\n\nRecent showers shattered shallot production in major onion production centres in the district and affected its quality. Fresh onions had to be consumed within a few days. Otherwise they would perish. Despite a good yield, the quality of onions was not as expected, said onion traders.\n\nThe market will stabilise only on the arrival of onions from other districts and from Mysore, they added.\n\nExport was not at all picking up owing to poor quality of onions.",
