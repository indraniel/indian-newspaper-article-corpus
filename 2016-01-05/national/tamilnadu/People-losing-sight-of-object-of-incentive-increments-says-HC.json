    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has expressed concern over people losing sight of the object of granting incentive increments to government schoolteachers for acquiring additional qualifications and wondered how could a physical education teacher seeking increment for acquiring a postgraduate degree in History.\n\nDismissing a writ appeal filed by a physical education teacher who sought increment after her retirement in 2005 for having acquired a degree in History in 1991, a Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran said: \u201cIt is quite unfortunate that the object of grant of advance incentive increments to teachers is, many a times, lost sight of.\n\n\u201cThe object is to encourage teachers to pursue higher education so that the education they pursue enures to the benefit of the students. In this case, the appellant is a physical education teacher. We do not know how the acquisition of an undergraduate and postgraduate degree in History would have enured to the benefit of students from a physical education teacher.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the claim of the appellant was to an increment that was due in 1991. She retired in 2005 and came to the court in 2014. Therefore, the learned single judge was perfectly justified in dismissing the claim fortunately without imposing costs.\u201d",
