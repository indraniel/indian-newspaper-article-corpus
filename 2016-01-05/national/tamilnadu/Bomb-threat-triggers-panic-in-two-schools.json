    "text": "Bomb threat at two matriculation schools triggered panic among students and their parents in Kovilpatti on Monday.\n\nBomb disposal squad, along with police personnel, rushed to the schools and launched combing operations. However, no bomb was to be found. Additional Superintendent of Police D. Kandasamy denied reports of anonymous calls received at these schools. He said that graffiti written on a water tank on Puthu Road that bombs would explode in the two schools at 9 a.m. triggered the panic. The police were informed about it around 8 a.m.\n\nAnxious parents turned up at these schools to take their children home. Almost all students had left the schools by 10.15 a.m.\n\nSources from Education Department said that most of the students from other schools in Kovilpatti were also picked up by their parents. There was a melee as auto-rickshaws and other vehicles thronged the schools to pick up the students.",
