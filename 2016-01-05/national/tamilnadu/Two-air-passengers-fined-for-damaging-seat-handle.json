    "text": "Two air passengers who travelled by an Air India Express flight to Tiruchi from Kuala Lumpur were fined for having allegedly damaged a seat handle inside the aircraft.\n\nS. Abdul Basit (28) of Chennai and S. Sheikh Abdullah (27) of Ilayangudi in Sivaganga district had occupied seats other than those assigned to them, prompting the crew to ask them to take their respective seats when the aircraft was flying.\n\nThe two reportedly argued with the crew claiming that they had occupied other seats to recharge their mobile phones.\n\nThe crew alerted the captain who apparently questioned them. The two allegedly were rude with the captain.\n\nUpon arrival of the flight in the early hours, an airline staff preferred a complaint with the Airport police station where the two were brought for questioning by the police.\n\nHours later, the airline staff withdrew the complaint stating that a compromise had been reached wherein the two would be fined Rs. 60,000 for having caused damage to the seat handle.",
