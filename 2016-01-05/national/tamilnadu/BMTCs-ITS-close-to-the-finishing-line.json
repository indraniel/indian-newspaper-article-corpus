Moreover, other issues were met. Finding out real-time traffic conditions for the system was difficult and we had to buy licences from Google,\u201d said Mr. Mishra.\n\nCumulatively, the information will first be fed into the basic mobile app of the BMTC which is scheduled for a revamp to make it \u201cmore useful\u201d in a couple of weeks. Currently, the app doesn\u2019t have real-time data, and displays bus schedules, irrespective of traffic or availability.\n\nHowever, Mr. Mishra said the ITS would see the app suggest alternative bus routes from a source to destination based on timings of the bus as well as a colour-coded scheme to suggest \u201ccongestion\u201d in oncoming buses.\n\nAfter years of being in cold storage, the project is expected to be completed by January 15",
