More exciting things are about to happen in the next 35 years in computing, biology and brain science,\u201d he said. The workshop will introduce interested students and faculty to research in computing and brain studies in progress across the world.\n\nIndia, as a big supplier of IT professionals to the world, has a large pool of talent that could be used for collaborative research, said Mr. Gopalakrishnan. \u201cThe workshop will be a key milestone as India could leverage its ecosystem and look at larger goals, and come up with innovative solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nIf for scientists Mriganka Sur from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Partha P Mitra, organisers of the workshop, it is about understanding how the circuitry of the brain works, scientist Anand Raghunathan of Purdue University is looking for opportunities to understand how to apply the circuitry of the brain and improve computer systems.\n\nTo a question on how the scientists could draw the students away from high-paying IT sector jobs, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said, \u201cA substantial number of students are already into innovating with applications. What they need is a role model, incentives and aspirations to achieve their goals. We are here to do that.\u201d\n\nWorkshop to\n\nfocus on ongoing research in computing and brain studies across the world",
