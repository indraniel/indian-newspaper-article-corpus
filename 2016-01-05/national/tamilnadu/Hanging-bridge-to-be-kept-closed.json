    "text": "The \u2018hanging bridge\u2019 that lends a crossover to the rocky edges for a bird\u2019s eyeview of the gushing falls in all likelihood will be kept closed for the foreseeable future, much to the dismay of tourists.\n\nThe bridge provides access to the reserve forest shared by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\n\nView point\n\nFor several months now, the entry to the bridge enclosure has been open to tourists only as a viewpoint.\n\nNo entry is permitted to the forests or the open rocks to view the falls.\n\nAccording to Collector K.Vivekanandan, the bridge cannot be opened till the edges are fortified by barricades from a 10 feet distance.\n\n\u201cThe closure of the hanging bridge has made a tangible difference to casualty.\n\nSince that part falls under the Forest Act no permanent structures can be constructed,\u201d says Mr.Vivekanandan.\n\nSources say the decision was impelled by the reckless behaviour of several tourists at the spot.",
