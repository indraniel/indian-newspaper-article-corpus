The team inspected the queue system formed for frisking of devotees and scanning of articles carried by them. They also inspected various watch towers erected around the temple on Chithirai Streets and also on Aadi Streets and reviewed the access control measures on the temple premises. The team visited Aadi Streets, prakaram, 1000-pillar hall and terrace of the temple. While police officials claimed that it was a routine inspection, the visit assumed significance in the backdrop of beefing up of security to all vital installations across the nation following the terrorist attack in Pathankot in Punjab.\n\n\u201cAfter the review, the NSG would propose any changes, if required, in the security measures already adopted for the temple,\u201d a police officer said.",
