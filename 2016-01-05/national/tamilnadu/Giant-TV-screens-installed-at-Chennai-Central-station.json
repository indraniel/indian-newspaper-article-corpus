These, however, may be a thing of the past with the Southern Railway installing a couple of giant LED screens in addition to plasma TVs at this bustling station.\n\nThree LED screens have been installed on the concourse of the station where passengers wait to board long-distance trains. While the screen at the centre displays the arrival and departure of trains, the two screens flanking it telecast entertainment shows, commercials, movie trailers and other messages. The screens were installed over a month ago. A number of small LED screens have also been connected.\n\n\u201cThe giant screens are helpful. Earlier, we had to crowd around small television screens to be updated with the timings of train arrivals and departures,\u201d said Narendra, a software professional and waiting to board a train. The Southern Railway is improving passenger amenities and the digital boards and plasma TV are part of them, officials said.",
