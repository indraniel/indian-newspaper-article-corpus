    "text": "As many as 117 members of Tamil Nadu Makkal Nala Paniyalar Sangam, including 32 women, were arrested for staging an agitation in front of the Christopher bus stand in Vadaseri here on Monday. Though the forum did not get permission for staging the agitation, the police allowed them to stage the protest with placards. But, suddenly, few of them, wearing only a towel, ran inside the bus stand and started begging from passengers. They demanded the State government to reinstate over 13,000 employees and withdraw an appeal petition filed in the Supreme Court against their reinstatement. They were released in the evening.",
