    "text": "Genuine cases will be considered, say police officials\n\nFamily members of about 50 police personnel in Coimbatore district thronged the office of the Inspector General of Police (IG), West Zone, at Race Course here on Monday seeking cancellation of their transfers. They claimed bias in the transfers.\n\nIt is learnt that about three months ago, more than 300 police personnel in lower ranks, who served in the same police station for more than three years, were transferred to the other police stations in the district. Last week, a few personnel were once again transferred for the elections.\n\nThe women - mostly from Pollachi - that their husbands were among many constables who were transferred for the second time in less than three months and that affected the studies of children and their families as they had to shift to another place.\n\nIG K. Shankar said that their grievances were over transfers and that they had to meet Superintendent of Police (SP) of Coimbatore district R.V. Ramya Bharathi as she was the transferring authority.\n\nIt is learnt that the SP asked the women to represent their grievances in writing.\n\nPolice officials said that on studying the individual petitions they would consider genuine cases (such as those on health grounds) as the welfare of police personnel was also important. However, the motive behind their demand for cancellation of transfers would also be studied as some personnel had served in the same station for long and wanted to remain there comfortably.",
