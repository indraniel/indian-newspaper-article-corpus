Radhakrishnan had a brush with a jallikattu bull when a group of villagers along with the animal were presenting him a petition on the issue on Monday.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan suffered a bruise in his hand at Sembikudi near Ariyalur on Monday when a bull suddenly shook its head while he was interacting with the group of people, which had brought their bulls along to urge the Central government lift the ban on the sport.\n\nThe Minister sustained the injury apparently when he placed his hand at the bull\u2019s horns, to feel its sharpness, party sources said. After getting treatment at the spot, the Minister resumed his programme.\n\nLater, speaking to reporters at Ariyalur, Mr.Radhakrishnan downplayed the incident and expressed confidence that the ban on jallikattu would be lifted.",
