    "text": "Seeking government\u2019s permission for mercy killing of their mentally deranged daughter, a couple from Kottakulam near Shencottai in the district submitted a petition to Collector M. Karunakaran on Monday.\n\nAs the 32-year-old woman is mentally ill since birth, the poor parents took her to several hospitals for treatment, but the treatment could not improve her mental health. When her condition worsened after she suffered from jaw deviation, the couple took her to Tenkasi Government Hospital and then to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for treatment.\n\nReferred to Chennai hospital\n\nWhen the treatment did not yield desirable results, her case was referred to Government Dental Hospital, Chennai, for specialised treatment, but the medical interventions did not provide any significant remedy to the woman, who cannot eat properly as the mouth remains opened.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sold whatever we had to meet her medical expenses. As all our efforts went in vain, my wife\u2019s health deteriorated. The small earnings of my two sons from their work as labourers in a saw mill at Shencottai are not sufficient to meet my daughter\u2019s medical expenses and run the family. Hence, the Collector should forward our case to the State government and obtain permission for mercy killing of our daughter as we\u2019ve lost all our hopes,\u201d said the father of the woman after submitting a petition to the Collector.",
