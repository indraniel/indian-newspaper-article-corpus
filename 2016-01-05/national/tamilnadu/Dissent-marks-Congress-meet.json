    "text": "In yet another case of dissension in the State Congress, a section of district presidents, said to owe allegiance to former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, boycotted a party meeting chaired by TNCC E.V.K.S. Elangovan on Monday accusing the latter of arbitrary functioning.\n\nIn a statement, the dissidents alleged that Mr. Elangovan was flagrantly violating party rules and was appointing and removing office-bearers according to his whims and fancies. The statement, also signed by a few TNCC vice-presidents and general secretaries, said the removal of district presidents in Salem and bifurcation of the party\u2019s Tirupur unit were examples of high-handed functioning.\n\nIn reaction, Mr. Elangovan claimed that the office-bearers were instigated by Mr. Chidambaram. \u201cFifty-four district presidents attended the meeting. Those who opposed are a miniscule minority. I know how to deal with this. I will expose the anti-party activities of Mr. Chidambaram at the appropriate time,\u201d he claimed.\n\nCentre slammed\n\nMeanwhile, the district presidents meeting passed six resolutions including one slamming the Centre for ignoring Tamil Nadu by not releasing adequate funds for flood relief and another demanding a judicial investigation into the alleged discrepancies in releasing water from Chembarambakkam lake on December 1 and 2 last year.\n\nChidambaram loyalists accuse Elangovan of arbitrary functioning",
