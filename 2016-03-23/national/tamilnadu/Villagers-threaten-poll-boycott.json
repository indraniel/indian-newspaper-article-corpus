    "text": "Condemning the delay in removing encroachment made by a brick kiln in their village, residents of Kandigaiperi have threatened to boycott the May 16 Assembly election.\n\nAfter the land meant for public use at Kandigaiperi, housing 860 voters, was allegedly encroached upon by a few individuals running a brick kiln, the villagers submitted a petition to Revenue Department officials seeking removal of the illegal structures. When the eviction drive got delayed, the villagers approached the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, which also directed the officials to remove the encroachments.\n\nHowever, the court\u2019s direction is yet to be translated into action.\n\nUpset over this, the villagers have kept a flex board at the village announcing their decision to boycott the election.\n\n\u201cAfter removing the illegal construction from the public utility land, the officials should take steps for constructing an anganwadi on the retrieved land and Kandigaiperi farmers, who suffered crop loss during the northeast monsoon, should be compensated adequately,\u201d the villagers said. To highlight their demands, the villagers also tied black flags in some houses, electricity poles and other public places.",
