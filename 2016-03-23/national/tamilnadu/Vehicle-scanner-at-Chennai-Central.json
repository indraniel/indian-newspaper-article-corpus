    "text": "In a move to step up security at the Chennai Central railway station, police have installed a new system \u2014 Under Vehicle Scanning System (UVSS). It was acquired and installed at the entry point on V.O.C. Salai (Wall Tax Road).\n\n\u201cWe had submitted our proposal last year itself, but it was approved now,\u201d said an officer of Railway Protection Force (RPF). The UVSS has a digital line scan camera and a sturdy weatherproof x-ray unit that scans the vehicle\u2019s chassis. It also scans both the front and back registration plates. The driver\u2019s face is also recorded in the megapixel camera installed in the front. \u201cThe monitor is manned by a policeman round the clock,\u201d he said.\n\nThe system will also help track crime and property offenders on the run as the numbers and photographs of the vehicle and driver will be automatically recorded, the officer said.\n\n\u201cIn case of such events, police officials can make use of the data and help track suspects,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cWe have not come across any suspicious vehicles so far, but we are vigilant,\u201d the officer added.",
