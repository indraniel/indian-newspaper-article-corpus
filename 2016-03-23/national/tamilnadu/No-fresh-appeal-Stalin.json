    "text": "DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Tuesday clarified that his party had not made any fresh appeal to actor Vijayakant to join the DMK alliance.\n\nAsked about DMK leader M. Karunanidhi\u2019s claim that he was hopeful of a tie-up with the DMDK, Mr. Stalin said the party supremo was only referring to his earlier appeal. \u201cIt has been construed as if a fresh appeal has been made and it caused the problem. We never held talks with the DMDK in the past and are not holding talks now. Of course, we made an appeal and it is up to the DMDK to take a decision. The appeal is still there,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the presence of three Muslim political outfits would not cause any seat-sharing problem. \u201cToday, the MMK firmed up the alliance with us. They will hold talks with the DMK-seat sharing committee after forming a committee of their own,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Stalin also said drafting the election manifesto had reached its final stage and it would be released soon.",
