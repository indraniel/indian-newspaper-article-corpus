Printers should obtain declarations from the publishers in two forms. The forms should have details of the number of posters or hand bills printed and the exact cost of the printing.\n\nThe printed material and the forms should be submitted to the Collector office within three days of printing.\n\nThe pamphlets should not be against law or point to any individual person, religion, caste, language, or community. Action as per law would be initiated against press owners if guidelines were violated and the licence of the press would be suspended, he said.",
