Amma will call us later,\u201d says an MLA in Chennai.\n\nParty seniors admit that not many sitting MLAs had been called over to Poes Garden. Perhaps party supremo Jayalalithaa is looking for fresh faces \u2013 has been the common refrain. According to party sources, around 50 candidates who had applied for ticket from constituencies in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Vellore, Dindigul and Madurai districts were called to Poes Garden for the interview on Tuesday.\n\nBut from Tirunelveli district, none of the sitting MLAs appeared for the interview, sources in the district confirmed.\n\nNot many might get to contest again in the May 16 elections due to various reasons, they added.\n\n\u201c Amma gives opportunities to youth as they have more energy and can devote more time to serve the people,\u201d claimed a party senior. In the first round, Ms. Jayalalithaa interviewed former MLA of R. K. Nagar, P. Vetrivel, who vacated his seat for her. Chennai Corporation Deputy Mayor Benjamin, Chennai Corporation Councillor Noorjahan Beevi, former member of Parliament Chitlapakkam Rajendran and sitting Uthankarai MLA Manoranjitham Nagaraj were also interviewed.\n\n( With additional inputs from P. Sudhakar in Tirunelveli )",
