Tuesday\u2019s seizure takes the total money seized to Rs. 1 crore.\n\nAnother release said that the district administration was watching mainstream media and also social media for paid news. While there was nothing wrong in carrying the interviews of candidates or leaders of parties, partisan news aimed at supporting one candidate or the other would be taken note of and acted upon. The news reports should also be in such a way that they did not incite a particular group or community.\n\nIt also said that the administration had earmarked 41 places for political parties to conduct meetings. For street corner meetings, the parties should get permission from returning officers.",
