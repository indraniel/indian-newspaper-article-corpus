Thirumavalavan, leader of the Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VCK), another constituent of the PWF, said talks were going on with the DMDK and efforts were being made to rope in Mr Vijayakant into the front. \u201cA turning point in the electoral politics of Tamil Nadu might happen anytime,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\nMr Thirumavalavan said Mr Vijayakant\u2019s speech at the state conference at Kancheepuram shutting the doors on the DMK and another speech at the party\u2019s women wing conference eliminating the BJP from the race gave the PWF the confidence.\n\nThree-cornered contest\n\n\u201cThere was a three-corned contest to win over the DMDK and now only the PWF is in the fray,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Vaiko said since the actor-turned-politician had declared a fight against rampant corruption in the State, he could not afford to join hands with the DMK and the AIADMK, the parties that were responsible for the current state of affairs.\n\nAsked about DMK leader M. Karunanidhi\u2019s recent remarks on a possible tie-up with the DMDK, Mr. Vaiko countered the question quoting DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin\u2019s assertion that no fresh appeal had been made to Mr. Vijayakant.\n\n\u201cNever in the history of the DMK has a statement of a party leader been denied in 24 hours. The DMK has been infiltrated by elements who have no idea of the history and ideology of the party. All the stalwarts of the party have been sidelined. It is a sad thing. I can only feel sorry for Mr. Karunanidhi,\u201d he said.",
