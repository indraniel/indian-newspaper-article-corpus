    "text": "Study finds that 94 per cent of the homeless in city live on the streets\n\nTwo days ago, 60-year-old Sivakumar, a blind homeless man living near Egmore railway station, entered the station to use the washroom.\n\nHe was beaten up and pushed away by the police officials manning the platform.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use their washrooms as we are not passengers. But we find a way to sneak in, as we have no other place to go to,\u201d said Sivakumar.\n\nAround 42 families live on the pavement near the Egmore station, while there is pay-and-use public convenience, most use the open tracks or pay Rs. 30 or Rs. 100 and sneak inside the station to use the toilet and take a bath.\n\n\u201cIt depends on why we need to use the toilets, if we want to use it for a longer time we have to pay Rs 100, or if any police official spots us we will be fined Rs. 500,\u201d said Soundarya, a flower seller who has been living on the tracks with other families for over 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe public toilet here is in a very bad state, the women\u2019s toilet has been shut for months now. Nothing has changed over the years, we continue to live in hell, in terms of both sanitation and safety,\u201d said Navodaya, another pavement dweller.\n\nWhile the Greater Chennai Corporation is coming up with 20 additional shelters for the homeless, in addition to the existing 31, a permanent solution is what these families seek. \u201cThese are just temporary accommodations; if allotted a proper house we will be able to live a lot better and without fear,\u201d said Navodaya.\n\nA study, conducted by the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities last year, reveals that 94 per cent of the homeless in Chennai live on the streets as families and 72 per cent of them have been living on the streets for over 30 years.\n\nWhile discussions with the people have revealed that they required housing, there was no provision to rehabilitate the homeless in any such facility as they do not come under the Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1971.\n\n\u201cThese are vulnerable communities who have lived here since generations, they need to be provided with proper documents and housing facility like other slum dwellers. Else, they will continue to live a precarious life,\u201d said Vanessa Peter, Policy Researcher at IRCDUC.\n\n\u201cThere is no State guidelines on providing housing for them as many are migrant workers,\u201d said a senior official of the Greater Chennai Corporation.\n\n\u201cThey must make use of the shelters at night and get a job to take care of their living, houses are only built for slum dwellers,\u201d he added.\n\nThere is no provision to rehabilitate them as they are not under the ambit of law",
