    "text": "The recently inaugurated Collectorate here is becoming an eyesore and unpleasant to visit due to the unattended garbage and foul smell constantly emanating from the toilets situated in all the first six floors.\n\nRubbish and food wastes can be seen lying on the \u2018cut spaces\u2019 provided in the main building itself to ensure adequate ventilation and to take pipelines.\n\nMost of the food wastes and used bottles are thrown by people working in the offices in each of the floors as it looked convenient for them to litter through the \u2018cut spaces\u2019.\n\nStinking toilets in each of the six floors are making the entry into the building uncomfortable. It is a daily sight to watch officers and visitors rushing past the toilet areas with their nose covered.\n\n\u201cCivic sense is lacking much as could be evident from the way the food wastes, plastic covers and bottles are dumped carelessly in the building itself. The district administration should take steps to provide bins for dumping the garbage and also remove the wastes periodically. Any person who throws wastes into the \u2018cut spaces\u2019 from the top should be punished,\u201d said N. Shanmugasundaram, president of Nallur Consumer Welfare Association, who is a frequent visitor to the Collectorate.\n\nAccording to activists and visitors, the administration should take steps to periodically disinfect the toilets and also the floors in general. \u201cIt look obvious that floors are not cleaned for many days,\u201d said P. Sundaram, who visited the Collectorate to enquire about welfare assistances.",
