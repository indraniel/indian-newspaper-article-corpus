Later, he was lodged at Salem Central Prison.\n\nRevenge killing\n\nIn 2015, conservancy worker Vijayakumar was murdered by a gang led by history-sheeter Suri of Kitchipalayam in Salem city. To take revenge on Suri, another gang led by Chelladurai killed Suri\u2019s son Napoleon. Chelladurai and his accomplice John were arrested by the police and were on conditional bail.\n\nAs per the bail condition, Chelladurai and John had to sign at the Judicial Magistrate Court No. II in Salem every day.\n\nOn February 22, when the duo was leaving the court after signing at 5 p.m., a 15-member gang hurled country-made bomb at Chelladurai and John outside the court premises. But they escaped unhurt as the bomb hit the court wall and exploded. In the impact, lawyer Murugan sustained injuries.\n\nThe gang chased Chelladurai and John on the court premises and hacked Alaguvel, who had come there for a case, and fled the scene.\n\nTeams formed\n\nHasthampatti police registered a case and six special teams were formed to nab the accused. The police said that Suri\u2019s son Silambarasan was behind the murder attempt.
