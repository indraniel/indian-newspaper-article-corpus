Rajaraman, said that the differently-abled persons need not wait in the regular queue of voters at any polling station. They can jump the queue and cast their votes.\n\nBesides, all the polling stations in the district have been provided with ramps for their benefit. \u201cWe have planned to provide wheel chairs for all required people at the polling stations on the day of polling,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a special camp organised for the visually challenged persons held at Sattur, the importance of voting and the means of enrolment, incorporating changes in the names and other details of facilities at polling stations were read out by a visually challenged person through the Braille guide provided by the Election Commission.\n\nUsing an online facility, the officials, in the presence of the Collector, checked whether the names of the differently abled persons figured in the voter list. The officials also handed over the details of the polling station, including its location, the part and serial numbers of the voters in the voter list, so that they could positively turn up at the polling station. \u201cOur aim is to ensure that 100 per cent of the differently-abled persons participate in the polling,\u201d the Collector, said.\n\nSattur Revenue Divisional Officer Krishnammal, Returning Officer Dhanalingam, Sattur Tahsildar R.K. Pushparajan took part.",
