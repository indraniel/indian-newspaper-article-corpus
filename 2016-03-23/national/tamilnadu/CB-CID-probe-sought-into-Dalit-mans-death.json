The family members, however, did not open any line of communication with the district administration that had invited them for talks to sort out the issue.\n\nBacked by a few organisations, the relatives had demanded that a case of murder be registered against a few upper caste persons.\n\nNo injuries on body\n\nThe police, however, maintained that the post-mortem had indicated that there was no internal or external injury on the body that is kept at the Mortuary of the Government Hospital in Coimbatore.",
