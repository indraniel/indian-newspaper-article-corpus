    "text": "Bracing up for a dry summer ahead in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, the Forest Department has focussed attention on water holes created in the interior areas.\n\nIn a handful of interior locations in STR, the Forest Department had, in recent years, installed solar-powered bore wells to fill water troughs.\n\nThe working of the bore wells was being set right in five interior locations, District Forest Officer of Sathyamangalam Division K. Rajkumar said.\n\nThe Department had dug bore wells to depths of 300 to 400 feet and had installed 3 hp motors for filling the water troughs. For water holes in a few other locations, replenishment was being carried out with pick-up vehicles, Mr. Rajkumar said.\n\nThe apprehension of water sources drying up in the forest area surfaced a few weeks back when a herd of Indian Gaur had reportedly strayed into a human habitation in T.N. Palayam Range.\n\nBut, Forest Department officials say sighting of Indian Gaurs on the fringes of Forest area is not unusual.\n\nNevertheless, the Department has set its sight on attending to the water points on the fringe areas so that the scope for straying of the wild animals, particularly, elephants, deer and Indian Gaurs, could be minimised.",
