I will not give up the constituency and will certainly contest from the same place.\u201d\n\nRecalling his contribution to the constituency, Mr. Vaithianathan said he believed he had fulfilled the needs of the people of the constituency. \u201cI extended all assistance to the needy. I never abused the post for personal reasons.\u201d He said he had convened the meeting after people started asking him why another MLA from another constituency was going around Lawspet seeking support for AINRC.\n\nMr. Vaithianathan said there was no concrete response from the party leadership when he questioned the move to field an alternative candidate in the constituency. He also said that he would announce his poll strategy in two days.",
