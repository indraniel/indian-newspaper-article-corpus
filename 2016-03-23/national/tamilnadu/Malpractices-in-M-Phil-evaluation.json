Phil examinations conducted in November 2015.\n\nIn a representation made to Higher Education Secretary Apoorva, ahead of the MKU Syndicate meeting scheduled to be held in Chennai on Wednesday, JAC-MKU has demanded the constitution of a committee with members from inside and outside the university to probe the alleged irregularities.\n\n600 answer papers\n\nClaiming that revaluation was done for more than 600 answer papers, JAC-MKU had alleged that 176 candidates had applied for revaluation from MKU Evening College in Periyakulam alone.\n\n\u201cOur allegation is that almost all the candidates passed after revaluation,\u201d an office-bearer of JAC-MKU told The Hindu .\n\nApart from this, JAC-MKU has also requested that the committee inquiring into the irregularities of lateral entry admissions through distance education in 2014-15 be reconstituted.\n\nPointing out that all the members in the present committee are from MKU, it had demanded the appointment of external members in the cadre of Deputy Secretaries to ensure free and fair probe.\n\nOther demands made by JAC-MKU included appointment to senior posts from the talent pool available within the university instead of choosing persons outside MKU so that the financial commitment of the university can be reduced.\n\nJAC-MKU had also pointed to the non-representation for SC / ST members in senior posts in the recent past.",
