    "text": "Southern Railway, which launched an initiative to do away with pasting reservation charts on two trains on a trial basis as part of a Go Green policy, announced that it had dropped the proposal following feedback from passengers.\n\nA press release said the Railways had conducted the trial to see whether the pasting of charts on compartments could be avoided as confirmed ticket holders were aware of their coach and berth numbers at the time of booking tickets.\n\nFurther, there was also a provision for passengers with tickets on the waiting list to check their coach and seat numbers by sending an SMS to 130.\n\n\u201cHowever, in response to the feedback received from passengers, Southern Railway has decided to go back to pasting of charts. Charts will now be pasted on all trains as done before,\u201d the release said.",
