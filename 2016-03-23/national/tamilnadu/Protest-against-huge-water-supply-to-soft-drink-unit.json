    "text": "Condemning Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board\u2019s reported decision to give 20 lakh litres of water from the Tamirabharani to a franchisee manufacturing Coke\u2019s beverages at Gangaikondan, People Welfare Front functionaries staged a demonstration on the banks of the river at Seevalaperi near here on Tuesday in connection with World Water Day (March 22).\n\nThe protesters alleged that Public Works Department had constructed a check dam across the river near Seevalaperi to ensure adequate flow and stagnation of water around infiltration wells supplying 20 lakh litres a day to Coke\u2019s beverage manufacturing unit at Gangaikondan, which had increased its production capacity. \u201cThis decision will kill farming operations and affect the public who rely on the Tamirabharani for their drinking water needs,\u201d they charged.\n\nDistrict secretary of Communist Party of India Kasi Viswanathan said that the Tamirabharani water was quenching the thirst of several million people in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar districts, besides nourishing a range of crops cultivated over a lakh hectares of land. If water from the perennial river was sold to Coke, it would seriously affect farming operations in the region and the drinking water schemes executed on an outlay of several crores of rupees would become meaningless as there would be no flow of water in the river.\n\n\u201cThe State government should withdraw its decision to sell water to Coke and also its rival Pepsi, both having their manufacturing units at Gangaikondan,\u201d Mr. Viswanathan said.\n\nDistrict secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist) K.G. Bhasakaran said that the transnational beverage giantshad established their units at Gangaikondan despite protest by political parties and agriculturists. \u201cGiving 20 lakh litres of water from the Tamirabharani to these companies for a throwaway price would only encourage them to go in for uncontrolled expansion,\u201d Mr. Bhaskaran said.\n\nMarumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\u2019s Tirunelveli Rural district secretary T.M. Rajendran said that the PWF would launch a series of agitation against the decision. MDMK\u2019s Tirunelveli City district secretary K.M.A. Nizam, party\u2019s State legal wing deputy secretary Arasu Amalraj, former Principal of MDT Hindu College V. Ponnuraj, office-bearers of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and Social Democratic Party of India participated in the demonstration.",
