    "text": "MSMEs stand to GAIN\n\nSome micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) here have been in the defence sector for some years now, some others have got into it in the recent past and there are many industries that aspire to become suppliers to defence sector.\n\nAs many as 80 MSMEs in Coimbatore are vendors (programme partners) for Larsen and Toubro in Coimbatore for manufacture of components for the defence sector.\n\nThe advanced technology centre of Lakshmi Machine Works also outsources some of its requirements.\n\nFurther, there are parts that are in need for the Air Force.\n\nOpportunities on the defence sector are only growing in Coimbatore for the MSMEs.\n\nApart from those supplying to the manufacturing facilities in the city, there are many MSMEs that make parts for the tier-one suppliers in other cities too.\n\nE.K. Ponnuswamy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries\u2019 Association, says that except for the standard components, the product requirements of the defence sector could be smaller in number.\n\nThe micro and small-scale units might not have the resources to develop the required tools or might require more orders to make the investments in production facilities viable.\n\nIn such cases, they need handholding \u2013 either by the Government or the private large-scale companies that are into defence products.\n\nHowever, the country is importing these components and at a huge cost. With focus on indigenisation, the MSMEs should be encouraged to get into the sector with common facilities and support from the Government.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nM. Soundariya Preetha)",
