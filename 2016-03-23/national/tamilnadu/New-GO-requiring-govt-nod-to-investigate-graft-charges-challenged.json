    "text": "The Madras High Court on Tuesday issued notice to the State government on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition that challenged a Government Order mandating prior approval of the government for initiating enquiry on corruption charges against public servants, irrespective of their rank or group.\n\nThe issue pertains to a petition filed by advocate P. Pugalenthi in 2010 challenging a GO that mandated prior approval of the Chief Secretary to probe corruption charges against IAS and IPS officials in the State. Replying to an order of Supreme Court dated May 6, 2014, which scrapped a similar provision in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, the petitioner claimed that the GO is in contravention to the judgment.\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the High Court directed the government to revisit its stand on mandatory approval to probe All India Service Officers on corruption charges in view of the law enunciated by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe government issued a GO on February 2 stating that the mandatory prior approval will apply to all the public servants irrespective of their rank or group.\n\nClaiming that the latest GO is in contempt of the apex court directions, the petitioner sought the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the government.\n\nBut the court refused to accept the plea, noting that the PIL has become infructuous as the government has passed a new GO. The court then disposed of the petition setting the advocate at liberty to challenge the latest GO. Mr. Pugalenthi has moved the present petition as advised by the court. When the PIL came up for hearing, the Bench admitted it and ordered notice to the government returnable by June 13.",
