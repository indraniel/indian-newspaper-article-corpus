Patients referred from these medical camps were admitted, treated and in case of need undergone surgery free of cost.\n\nDuring the camp, the community was also counselled on the spread, prevention and control of common diseases, especially disorders that are spread in conditions of poor environmental hygiene.\n\nMedical students also distributed pamphlets and brochures to the community members to raise awareness regarding early detection of oral cancer.\n\nApart from providing information regarding available health facilities to manage these diseases, medical students also explained procedures to avail benefits under various government social welfare programmes.\n\nAccording to PIMS doctors, through this community based activity, students were not only sensitised towards health needs of the rural people but also to the realm of conducting research. Students were trained in carrying out the various steps of research from protocol writing to the preparation of final report.\n\nA Swachh Bharat Campaign was conducted in Chunampet that featured an awareness rally highlighting the importance of cleanliness.",
