Siva Saravanan\n\nWorks on one section (first level) of the flyover coming up at Gandhipuram are scheduled to be completed by June this year.\n\nHowever, this section (from Nanjappa Road to Sathyamangalam Road) can be completed only after taking the High Tension power cables on 100 feet road underground.\n\nSources say the cables are expected to arrive by the end of this month. The Highways Department will take up the underground cable work under the guidance and supervision of Tangedco as it is a challenging work. The work is expected to commence in May and get over by June.\n\nConstruction work for the Rs. 162-crore project took off in July last year and is scheduled to be completed by mid 2017. It includes a four-lane flyover for 1.75 km from Nanjappa Road to Sathyamangalam Road (first level) with service lanes on either side, and a two-lane second level flyover from 100-feet road to Avarampalayam junction.\n\nK. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, says that this shows lack of planning in executing different works in the project. The underground cable work should have been taken up earlier.\n\nWhen the proposal was approved, all departments should have taken necessary action simultaneously.\n\nRegarding the two-lane service road on either side of the flyover, he said that if space was available under the flyover, it should be provided for parking of two-wheelers.",
