These \u2018fire lines\u2019 will help avoid any dry plants from catching fire which could eventually spread deep into the forests,\u201d said District Forest Officer A. Periasamy.\n\nFor ensuring adequate water inside the forests itself, the officials have now repaired two check dams, and impounded water over an expanse of 1.5 acre each and 15 ft deep.\n\nTen artificially created troughs inside the forests in Udumalpet and Amaravathi ranges have been cleaned now to periodically fill with fresh water.\n\n\u201cWe will be filling four of the troughs with water drawn from solar-power operated borewells. The remaining six troughs will be filled by forest officials with water taken through tractors,\u201d said Mr. Periasamy.\n\nForest officials said that animals which were found consuming agriculture crops in many areas actually come out for water.\n\n\u201cWhen they see the crops, they tend to eat them. So providing enough water sources can prevent man-animal conflicts,\u201d they said.",
