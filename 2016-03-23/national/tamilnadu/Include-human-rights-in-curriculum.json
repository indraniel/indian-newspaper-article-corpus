Despite advocating the need for human rights education in syllabus, universities were reluctant to include it. Calling it unfortunate, he said nevertheless, teachers should mould students with a sense of social equality in their minds to end caste discrimination. He said human rights literacy was not widespread and its value was largely unknown to people.\n\nBeula Shekar, Department of Victimology, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, and B. Radha, Department of Communication, MSU, also spoke.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Tiphagne released a book, \u2018Promoting Human Rights Culture in Higher Education Institutions,\u2019 and Mr. Ganesan received the first copy. . A. Joycilin Shermila, Principal, welcomed the gathering.",
