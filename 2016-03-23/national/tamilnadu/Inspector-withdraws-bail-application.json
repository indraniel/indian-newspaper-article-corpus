    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday dismissed as withdrawn a bail application filed by Inspector of Police S. Gopinathapandian (now under suspension) in a highway dacoity case registered against him by Thadikombu police in Dindigul district last month.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel chose to withdraw the application after Justice P.N. Prakash expressed strong reservations over granting the relief to the petitioner who happened to be a police officer. According to the prosecution, the Inspector robbed cigarette dealer Sivaperumal of Thathaneri here of cigarette bundles worth Rs. 36 lakh and Rs. 2.5 lakh in cash when the latter was nearing Dindigul in a van, along with two of his friends, after purchasing the bundles from Bangalore on February 12.\n\nClaiming to have been arrested by Thadikombu police on February 13, the Inspector said that the police kept him under illegal custody for three days before remanding him in judicial custody on February 15. He also pointed out that a Sessions Court in Dindigul dismissed his first bail application on March 14.",
