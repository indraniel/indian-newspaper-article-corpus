    "text": "Three sisters suffering from vitiligo have approached the district administration, accompanied by their grandfather, who also had the skin ailment, seeking assistance for survival.\n\nDue to poverty, Nandhini (20) remained illiterate all through, while her sisters Keerthana (7) and Nithya (8) were studying in school. Their other two sisters Renuka (11) and Jothika (15) who were free from the skin ailment were also in school.\n\nAll the three vitiligo-affected sisters had 75 per cent affliction, and were entitled to government assistance, but the help had eluded them for the last few years, despite repeated representations.\n\nHailing from Karattupalayam in Gobi Taluk, the sisters had lost their mother three years ago, who, according to their father Ganesan (50) died of worry over the plight of their daughters. Their eldest daughter Nandhini was not in a position to work anywhere.\n\nAnalysing their predicament, District Collector S. Prabakar reportedly instructed the Gobi Tahsildar to process the request of Nandhini for monthly assistance of Rs. 1,000 within the earliest possible time. According to their grandfather Mani (67), he had been given to understand that the two school-going granddaughters will be provided assistance on an annual basis.\n\nOfficials had reportedly told Mani and Ganesan that their case was genuine and had wondered why they had not secured the entitled assistance for long.",
