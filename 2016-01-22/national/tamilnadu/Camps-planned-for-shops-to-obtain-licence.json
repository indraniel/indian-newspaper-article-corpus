For these shops to obtain trade and labour licence, the Office of the Labour Officer (Enforcement) is holding special registration camp from January 20 till February 17. However, only 18, 256 are registered in Puducherry region.\n\nUnder the Puducherry Shops and Establishments Rules, 1964, within 30 days from the date of commencement of the shop or establishment, an employer has to send a statement in Form-1 seeking registration to the concerned area inspector. However, many shops continue to run without registration certificate causing huge revenue loss and affecting the safety and rights of the employees.\n\nLabour officer (Enforcement Cell) S.K.Rao, in Puducherry, on Wednesday said that the Labour Department along with the Chamber of Commerce have organised the special camp to facilitate registration and renewal of the Establishments in all commune panchayat or municipalities.\n\nThis is an annual drive which began in 2011. \u201cTill 2010, there were only 8,484 shops registered under the Shops and Establishment Act. Beginning from 2011 to 2016, the number of shops registered has increased by 9,772. This has led to an increase in the revenue to the government as well,\u201d he said.\n\nIn total, there are 24,105 units registered under Shops and Establishments Act having a workforce of 68,281 and 2,472 units registered under the Catering Establishments Act, having a workforce of 14,627 in the Union Territory of Puducherry.\n\nUnder the Shop Act and Catering Establishment Act, every employer has to obtain registration certificate and renew the same every year for three years. Running the business without obtaining registration certificate is a violation of the provisions under the acts and liable to prosecution. \u201cWe have the powers to inspect shops and slap fine up to Rs 2500. Hence, we request all the employers of the shops and establishments, catering establishments and motor transport undertakings to register and renew their establishments,\u201d he said. Tourism and Welfare Minister P.Rajavelu inaugurated the special camp.",
