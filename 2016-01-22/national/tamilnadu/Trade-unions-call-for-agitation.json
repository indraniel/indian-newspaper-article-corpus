    "text": "A meeting of leading trade unions here has resolved to organise an agitation on February 2 in protest against the delay in arriving at a new wage pact for the textile workers here.\n\nCITU State secretary M. Chandran told The Hindu that AITUC, ATP, LPF, MLF, INTUC, BMS, and HMS along with his union would jointly hold the agitation in front of the Tirupur Exporters Association office.\u201cThough the existing four-year wage agreement is going to end this month, the textile associations are delaying the final round of talks citing one reason or another,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trade unions decided to distribute leaflets containing the new set of demands to the textile associations, and textile workers and make them aware of their rights.\n\nThe trade unions had been demanding 100 per cent raise in wages as the inflation had shot up significantly in the last four years.\n\nBesides, the unions wanted introduction of perks like house rent allowance and educational allowance.",
