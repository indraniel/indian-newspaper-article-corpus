Only after it is done will we be able to continue the trial run of trains on the new stretch,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe next stretch of Chennai Metro Rail from Little Mount to Nanganallur Road may be commissioned in about six months. Though officials say this disruption of trial run will not affect the deadline, sources say it is likely to delay the process. The track work was completed sometime ago and it was decided to start the trial run. Now effort is on to complete the remaining work.",
