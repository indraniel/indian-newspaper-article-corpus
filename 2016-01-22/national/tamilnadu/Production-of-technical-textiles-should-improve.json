In the global scenario, the ratio is exactly the reverse. However, we think that there is no need to overcome the disparity for the mere reason that cotton is also an important natural fibre on which lots of employment, livelihood and agriculture is dependent,\u201d she told The Hindu here on Thursday.\n\nAccording to her, the Ministry has now been giving focus to improve the domestic production of technical textiles as an \u2018import substitution\u2019 by coming out with value-added products through research. \u201cWe are already in the process of developing prototypes and medical textiles meant for artificial implants, among others,\u201d the Textile Commissioner said.\n\nNew facilities\n\nOn the day, Union Minister of State for Textiles Santosh Kumar Gangwar inaugurated workers\u2019 hostel and a building for an industrial unit.\n\nHe also laid the foundation for buildings for two more industrial units, all on the premises of Palladam Hi-Tech Weaving Park.\n\nThe total expenditure for the projects was Rs. 34 crore, with Rs. 13 crore coming as government grant under different schemes.",
