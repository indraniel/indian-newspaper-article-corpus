Stalin and party MLAs address the media after staging a walkout from the Assembly in Chennai on Thursday.- Photo: B. Jothi Ramalingam\n\nThe Assembly witnessed a heated exchange between the ruling AIADMK and the DMK on Thursday with senior members questioning each other if their respective parties had the courage to face the elections alone.\n\nDuring the debate on the Governor\u2019s address, DMK MLA J. Anbazhagan raised the issue of alleged mismanagement of the Chembarambakkam reservoir during the December 2015 floods.\n\nPublic Works Minister O. Pannerselvam refuted the charges with an elaborate reply that quoted statistics to support the government\u2019s action. He also took on DMK president M. Karunanidhi for spreading lies on the issue.\n\nLater, Mr. Anbazhagan and Deputy Leader of the DMK Durai Murugan commented that the public would not believe the government irrespective of the length of the reply.\n\nOn his feet immediately, Housing Minister R. Vaithilingam said the AIADMK, under the leadership of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, was confident of people\u2019s support and it was the DMK that went \u201cbegging\u201d for allies. He also asked if the DMK had the courage to contest the elections alone.\n\nIn response, Mr. Durai Murugan asked if the AIADMK was prepared to face the polls without the support of even smaller parties such as the Forward Bloc. Later, gesturing towards the treasury benches, he said that Mr. Pannerselvam had given a long reply posing several questions, which would be answered in June. Rebutting, Minister Natham. R. Viswanathan said the dream of the DMK to come back to power will never be fulfilled.",
