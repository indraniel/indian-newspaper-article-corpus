    "text": "Minister for Prohibition and Excise Natham. R. Viswanathan on Thursday categorically said imposition of prohibition in the State was not possible in the current scenario.\n\nReplying to comments made by DMDK MLA B. Parthasarathy, he said that since States all around Tamil Nadu have not implemented prohibition, such a policy here would lead to growth of spurious liquor.\n\nHe said if the Centre decides to implement the policy across the country and compensates the resultant revenue loss for the States, Tamil Nadu would be the first to welcome the move.\n\nDuring the reply, Mr. Viswanathan also recalled what DMK president M. Karunanidhi said in 1972 when prohibition was first lifted.\n\n\u201cMr. Karunanidhi likened the State to a camphor surrounded by a ring of fire,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his feet, DMK MLA Durai Murugan said that instead of saying yes or no when asked if the government would implement prohibition, the Minister was making unnecessary remarks. To this, Mr. Viswanathan repeated that Tamil Nadu would welcome the move if prohibition is imposed across the country.\n\nHe also took a dig at the Left parties saying they did not impose prohibition in States ruled by them.\n\nLater, CPI (M) MLA K. Balakrishnan urged the State to ban liquor gradually.\n\nSuch a policy\n\nhere would lead\n\nto growth of spurious liquor, says Minister",
