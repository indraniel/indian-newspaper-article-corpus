    "text": "The ban on the jallikattu rocked the Assembly on Thursday with the Opposition demanding at least a resolution in favour of the sport and the ruling party lambasting the Congess-DMK combine for the ban.\n\nAs the zero hour started, the DMK MLAs led by M.K. Stalin sought for a discussion on jallikattu. Speaker P. Dhanapal, however, denied permission and asked them to take it up during the debate on the Governor\u2019s address.\n\nDespite repeated pleas, the Speaker refused any discussion forcing the DMK MLAs to walk out. CPI(M) floor leader A. Soundararajan and CPI\u2019s S. Gunasekaran wanted the House to at least adopt a resolution .\n\nFinance Minister O. Panneerselvam said as the matter was subjudice the resolution could not be adopted. The Chief Minister was taking legal efforts for holding the sport, he pointed out.\n\nThe Left leaders argued that the House has passed many resolutions earlier on issues pending in the court. As there was no favourable response, they also walked out.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress MLA S. Vijayadharani asked the State to bring ordinance in support of the sport.\n\nIn reply, Mr. Pannerselvam said it was the UPA government led by the Congress of which the DMK was a constituent that issued a notification banning bulls from being used for performances. Therefore, both the parties had no locus standi to raise the issue.\n\nOutside the House, Mr. Stalin told reporters that the DMK government had, in 2009, enacted the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act by prescribing norms (to ensure the safety of animals, participants and spectators). The sport was banned in 2014 as the subsequent AIADMK government failed to implement the safeguards, he alleged.",
