Sundar, site director, KKNPP, told The Hindu .\n\nAfter the control rods were gradually lifted to increase neutron concentration inside the core, where 163 bundles of enriched uranium fuel bundles have been kept, the dilution of boron solution started to facilitate early chain reaction.\n\nOnce the boron dilution is started, it would allow neutron concentration to go up and eventually kick-start nuclear fission that will generate the heat required for producing water vapour which, in turn, would operate the turbine to generate electricity. As the FAC and boron dilution were smooth, the reactor attained criticality at 4.19 p.m., Mr. Sundar said.\n\nThe FAC is an important step towards the beginning of power production. The approval has been given by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) after in-depth review of safety aspects. The clearance for the FAC is the culmination of in-depth review of all safety aspects, commissioning results, corrective measures of the identified non-conformances and submissions regarding fulfilment of regulatory requirements.\n\nThe reviews had included checks to ensure if quality assurance norms have been followed and the commissioned systems meet the acceptance criteria for safe operation.\n\n\u201cPower generation will commence within five days. It will be further raised in stages. At every stage, mandatory tests will be conducted and technical parameters verified,\u201d Mr. Sundar said.\n\nThough the KKNPP administration had originally planned to restart the reactor within 60 days from the date (June 23, 2015) on which it was stopped for removal of spent fuel, this exercise and allied tests consumed more time than anticipated as the technology involved in the 1,000 MW VVER reactor supplied by Russia is completely new to the scientists and engineers of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, the proponent of the project.\n\nMoreover, every mandatory test was conducted twice to reassure the smooth functioning of safety systems.",
