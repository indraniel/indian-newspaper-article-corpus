Water management is the most essential for the survival, economic prosperity and security of the state. However, the promises have not been implemented.\n\nWith Mettur Dam receiving all the sewage from Karnataka and with the citizens of both urban and rural areas dumping the wastes and sewage in water bodies, the crisis has already been blown over and over again.\n\nDespite the huge disaster striking the state, the government has not launched any effective step for proper water management.\n\nThe members of the Forum distributed pamphlets containing the details of the encroachments to the passersby, seeking their support.\n\nMr. Piyush said that the protest campaign will be continued and the tricycle will visit various parts of the city to mobilise people\u2019s support from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.",
