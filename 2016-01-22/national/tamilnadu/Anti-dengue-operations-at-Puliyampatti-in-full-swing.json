They complained that their repeated appeals to their village panchayat for launching a massive cleaning operation in the hamlet to avert a possible dengue outbreak was not given due attention.\n\nThe local body, following stringent warning from the Assistant Director of Panchayats, started cleaning operations only after the village lost one of its citizens, they complained.\n\nThe protestors were pacified with the assurance that all-out efforts would be taken to weed out dengue from Puliyampatti.\n\nAfter Thalarkulam near Mukkoodal in the district witnessed dengue outbreak before the start of northeast monsoon last year, anti-dengue operations were conducted in an intense manner to contain the disease.",
