The move comes in the wake of dengue cases being reported in the neighbouring Tirunelveli district.\n\nInitially, anti-dengue operations were taken up at Tooveypuram here. A team comprising urban health nurses, sanitary inspectors, sanitary workers, supervisors and malarial mazdoors identified breeding sources of dengue-causing mosquitoes and worn out things left near houses by conducting a door-to-door exercise, City Health Officer, Thoothukudi Corporation, Pradeep V. Krishnakumar told The Hindu .\n\nAnti-dengue operations would be carried out in 40 wards of the corporation. Breeding sources would be destroyed by spraying abate solution and indoor and outdoor fogging would also be done extensively. To raise awareness about dengue, pamphlets highlighting do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to maintain cleanliness to prevent the outbreak of the disease were also being distributed to residents. More importantly, defrost trays attached to refrigerators should be cleaned once in five days as the stagnant water in such trays could turn into a breeding ground for mosquitoes.\n\nThe siddha concoction \u2018Nilavembu kudineer\u2019 was also being distributed to people as a measure of building immunity against the vector-borne disease. He also sought the cooperation of the people in carrying out cleaning operations in houses.",
