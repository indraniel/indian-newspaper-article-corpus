Gokulraj.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing, Public Prosecutor Ramesh said that nine cases were pending against Yuvaraj and provisions under the Goondas Act have been invoked against him.\n\nIf he was released on bail, he may threaten witnesses. Yuvaraj\u2019s lawyer R. Krishnan said that there was no evidence against him, and hence should be released on bail.\n\nIt is for the second time that the bail petition of the founder of Theeran Chinnamalai Gounder Peravai was being dismissed.\n\nOn December 7, the judge had dismissed the bail petition field by Yuvaraj.\n\nYuvaraj\u2019s lawyer said that Madras High Court would be moved seeking bail. Yuvaraj is lodged at Vellore Central Prison.\n\nThe CB-CID had on January 7 filed a 725-page charge sheet, naming 17 people as accused in the Gokulraj murder case.",
