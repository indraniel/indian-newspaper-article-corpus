Gajalakshmi, has said.\n\nMs. Gajalakshmi made this announcement while releasing the final electoral rolls on Wednesday. DMK representatives claimed that names of deceased voters were still in the list published in September, after the summary revision.\n\nThey said Booth Level Officers (BLOs) had refused to entertain applications for deletion of names that they had submitted along with death certificates. The BLOs insisted that such applications should be presented by the kin of the deceased voters only. When the DMK representatives asked the DEO to clarify whether the EC had issued any instruction in this regard, she said if there were any discrepancies or duplication of voters\u2019 names in the final rolls published on Wednesday, they could be set right during special camps that would be on January 31 and February 6.",
