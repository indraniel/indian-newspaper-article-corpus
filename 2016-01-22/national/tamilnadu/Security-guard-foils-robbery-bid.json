In the meantime, the public joined in and pinned down the offender.\n\nThe Chithode police rushed to the spot on information and admitted Jamal to a private hospital and the injured offender to a government hospital. Superintendent of Police M.R. Sibi Chakravarthy invited the guard and the public who had overpowered the offender.",
