    "text": "The invoking of the provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, to arrest three men in connection with the death of four persons, including three manual scavengers, due to asphyxiation while entering a septic tank of a restaurant at Okkiyam-Thoraipakkam on Tuesday, has been welcomed by activists.\n\nThe police are probing whether the restaurant staff had supplied alcohol to the workers before they entered the septic tank.\n\n\u201cWe have been fighting to ensure that cases are filed under the Act whenever some person is found involved in manual scavenging or a life is lost due to this. All these years, these were treated as accidents. Finally, our efforts have paid off,\u201d said S.K. Siva, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Odhukapattor Vazhvu Urimai Iyakkam. M. Ravanaiah, organising secretary, Tamil Nadu Adi Andhra Arunthathia Maha Sabha, said he was happy that the police had finally taken strict action under the Act.\n\nWas alcohol supplied?\n\nMeanwhile, the police are investigating whether liquor was provided to the victims before they entered the septic tank. Investigators said if the victims consumed liquor, their ability to escape from the difficult situation would have been weakened. Whether the hotel management arranged for liquor could be ascertained based on the statement of Viji, another person who swooned while trying to rescue the persons trapped in the septic tank.",
