    "text": "Categorically denying allegations that discharge of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir was mismanaged during the December floods, Public Works Minister O. Panneerselvam on Thursday said the Opposition was spreading falsehood on the issue.\n\nReplying to DMDK MLA B. Parthasarathy during the debate on the Governor\u2019s address, Mr. Panneerselvam said the people were well aware that the floods happened due to unprecedented rain in a century. Even the Opposition did not raise any questions on this till December 9.\n\nMr. Panneerselvam said as per norms, water levels in reservoirs were to be maintained at two feet lower than capacity during the monsoon season. On November 30, the reservoir\u2019s water level was 22.05 ft against maximum level of 24 ft. The inflow into Chembarambakkam began to rise on December 1. While it was the duty of the Assistant Engineer to monitor the water levels, a senior PWD officer was also pressed into duty given the situation. The release was 10,000 cusecs at 10 a.m. and gradually went up to 29,000 cusecs by 6 p.m. This level of discharge was maintained till the afternoon of December 2 and then was gradually decreased. According to him, Chembarambakkam constituted only 44 per cent of the total catchment of the Adyar river. The heavy rain of 47 cm in some catchment areas and 30 cm in Chennai city and the excess water from 166 waterbodies joined the Adyar flow.",
