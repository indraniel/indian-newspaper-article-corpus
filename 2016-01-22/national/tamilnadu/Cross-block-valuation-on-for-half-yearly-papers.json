    "text": "In a new arrangement introduced this year, half yearly exam answer sheets of class X and XII students in government schools in every block of Tiruvannamalai district is to be valued in other blocks. The answer sheets would be exchanged between schools in neighbouring blocks and teachers would value them in the school itself.\n\nUsually the half yearly answer sheets would be valued by the teachers of the same class and same school. Chief Educational Officer Pon Kumar introduced the cross block valuation with a motive of doing reality check on the progress of students before the public exams.\n\nMr. Kumar told The Hindu , \u201cSince there is a chance of teachers showing lenience in the valuation of papers of their own students, this arrangement has been introduced. This system is already there in districts like Kancheepuram but it is new for our district. Valuation of papers of completed exams has already begun. Papers would be valued a day after the exam. It will enable us to evaluate the student precisely and let us know the problem areas. This will give us valuable time before public exams to work on the students and schools performing poorly.\u201d",
