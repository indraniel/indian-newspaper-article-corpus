Venkaiah Naidu.\n\nAddressing reporters here on Thursday, Mr. Naidu wondered why Mr. Gandhi did not visit the University of Hyderabad earlier where nine students had committed suicide between 2008 and 2014.\n\nThe Left parties which had lost the people\u2019s faith launched a false campaign against the NDA government.\n\nThe suicide note of the scholar clearly mentioned that no one was responsible for his death, Mr. Naidu noted.\n\nThe NDA government had allotted over Rs. 50,000 crore for improving infrastructure. A sum of Rs. 10,000 crore had been earmarked for disbursal as crop insurance to protect the interest of farmers, he said. The Centre was taking efforts to establish scores of ports and airports to connect every part of the country.\n\nAnswering a query, Mr. Naidu said that though price of crude oil had plummeted to an all-time low in the international market, the prices of petroleum products were not reduced in India because the revenue earned from taxes on petrol and diesel were used for various development works.\n\nPeople were fed up with the two Dravidian parties which ruled Tamil Nadu for over four decades, and wanted a change of guard now. Except the Congress, all parties had alliance with BJP in the past. As the Assembly elections come closer, more parties would join with BJP, Mr. Naidu said.\n\nUnion Minister of Stare for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon. Radhakrishnan and State BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan accompanied Mr. Naidu.",
