Halli on Monday morning.\n\nThey had come looking for her nephew Subhan who had allegedly assaulted them in K.J. Halli police limits. He has been missing ever since a police case was registered. His aunt Maulunnissa was alone at home when the men arrived. As soon as she opened the door, they barged in with knives and machetes, and ransacked the house searching for Subhan. When Maulunnissa objected, they assaulted her.",
