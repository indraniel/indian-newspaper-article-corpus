    "text": "Noting that it is quite apparent that government officials are in collusion with illegal miners in Tiruppur district, the Madras High Court has directed the CB-CID to file a charge sheet on the illegal mining operations.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a contempt application moved by D. Prabakaran seeking to punish the Tiruppur Collector and his subordinates for disobeying the court\u2019s orders.\n\nOriginally, Mr. Prabakaran filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking to prohibit illegal mining of gravel and sand in Aeripalayam and Pudhupalayam villages of Avinashi taluk, Tiruppur.\n\nThe High Court passed an interim stay against the authorities from granting permission for mining pending disposal of the petition. Claiming that despite the order, the authorities are allowing mining in the specified areas, Mr. Prabakaran moved the contempt plea seeking action against the officials.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing, the Bench said, \u201cThere is a prima facie case of collusion between the officials and the miners.\u201d It then directed the CB-CID to make requisite permission from the government to file FIR against the officials.\n\nThe Bench further observed that the court expects the government to decide on the permissions sought by the CB-CID within 15 days.\n\nThe judges then posted the matter to June 27 for compliance.\n\nPetitioner said that illegal mining was on despite a\n\ncourt order against the activity",
