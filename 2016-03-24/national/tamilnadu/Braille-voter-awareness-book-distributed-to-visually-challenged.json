Dakshinamoorthy distributed the handbook prepared by the Election Commission to the visually challenged voters in the district.\n\nThere are around 300 visually challenged electors in the district and the Collector asked them to exercise their democratic right without fail. The handbook educates them on how to register themselves as electors, deletion of names, online registration and exercise their rights during voting.\n\nMr. Dakshinamoorthy said that of the 1,569 polling booths in all the six Assembly constituencies in the district, 636 polling booths will have a ramp so that visually challenged voters can enter the polling booths without difficulty. Also, wheel chairs with helpers would be available in these polling booths.\n\nHe said that the Braille handbooks are available at voters\u2019 facilitation centres established at collectorate, District Library, Revenue Divisional Offices and Tahsildar offices. He assured the visually challenged electors that all facilities for enabling them to cast their vote without any trouble would be in place in polling booths.",
