Karuppaiah, State joint general secretary of the Movement, told reporters that Vasuki, the Dalit woman, had given an application for the certificate at the office of Revenue Divisional Officer at Dharapuram in December 2015.\n\nThough the RDO has asked a report from the Tahsildar before the issuance of the certificate, the taluk level official is yet to give the report, he said.\n\n\u201cDespite our repeated representations, no action was taken,\u201d he added. When contacted, revenue officials said they would look into the complaint on its merit.",
