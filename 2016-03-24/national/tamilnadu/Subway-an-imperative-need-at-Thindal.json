GOVARTHAN\n\nRapid development of Thindal and surroundings in the Erode-Perundurai stretch has caused proportionate problems for pedestrians to walk along or cross the road.\n\nUrbanisation is fast spreading in Thindal and surroundings, and the residential localities are bound to grow by leaps and bounds once the third phase of Ring Road project gets complete.\n\nThe road already witnesses heavy movement of vehicles. While accident prevention in Thindal area is ensured through placing of barricades, crossing of the road continues to be a nightmare for pedestrians.\n\nThe struggle of pedestrians, particularly students of the various educational institutions in the area and elders visiting the famous Thindal Murugan Temple, becomes quite noticeable during the morning and evening hours.\n\nPedestrians cross the road with constant fear of being hit by vehicles.\n\nElders find it difficult to cross the road without the support of others, C.S. Gowthaman, Member Zonal Railway Users' Consultative Committee, said.\n\nAccording to locals, residents\u2019 associations in several localities in and around Thindal had made umpteen representations to the City Corporation in the past. They have been given to understand that their demand would be accommodated in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan.\n\nA few associations had also mooted the idea of foot over bridges. But, by and large, the general opinion is that subways are safer than foot over bridges.",
