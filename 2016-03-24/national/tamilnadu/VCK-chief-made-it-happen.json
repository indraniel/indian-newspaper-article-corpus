    "text": "Convincing the DMDK to join hands with the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) was perhaps an important landmark in the political journey of VCK founder Thol. Thirumavalavan, who first gave shape to the idea of a non-DMK, non-AIADMK front.\n\nThe seed for the front was sown during the run up to the Lok Sabha elections when the VCK was treated poorly by the DMK with an initial offer of a lone seat. Following the polls, Mr. Thirumavalavan decided to explore the idea of bringing together smaller parties on the platform of \u201ccoalition government\u201d.\n\nIn early 2015, the VCK decided to hold a conference on the topic. Weeks earlier, he met CPI (M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan and tossed the idea of an alternative front. \u201cThe Left was very receptive. I then met the then CPI State secretary D. Pandian, who also readily welcomed the idea,\u201d he said. An alternative front was also considered necessary as the two major Dravidian parties failed to even condemn atrocities against Dalits strongly.\n\nWhen the MDMK was first approached, there was reluctance as the DMK had been sending feelers to them. But together, Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Thirumavalavan brought Mr. Vaiko on board, post which the alliance took off thanks to Mr. Vaiko\u2019s aggressive propaganda.",
