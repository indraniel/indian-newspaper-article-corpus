    "text": "Federation of Bar Associations of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry has decided to withdraw the proposed court boycott on March 24 and instead would file a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking due representation for lawyers practicing in district courts for appointment as judges in Madras High Court. Addressing media persons here on Wednesday, federation chairman P. Paramasivam, quoting Bar Council of India, said that the issue was argued before a constitution bench in the Supreme Court earlier. But, the orders were not favourable to us, he added. He said that the details of the case in the apex court came to the federation\u2019s knowledge only now and they decided to withdraw the proposed court boycott. He said that more than 60,000 lawyers would attend the court proceedings on Thursday. - Staff Reporter",
