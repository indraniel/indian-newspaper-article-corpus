Sarathkumar at her Poes Garden residence on Wednesday. \u2014Photo: Special Arrangement\n\nLess than a month after parting ways with the ruling AIADMK to join NDA, actor and leader of All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi R. Sarathkumar, on Wednesday, met Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and renewed the friendship between the two parties.\n\n\u201cWe had a cordial meeting and decided to contest the elections together. Other modalities will be discussed later,\u201d Mr. Sarathkumar told The Hindu .\n\nAsked why he had agreed to be part of the AIADMK front after holding talks with BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, Mr. Sarathkumar said there had been no progress on the front.\n\n\u201cWe waited. But it could not move forward. We already convened a meeting of the party functionaries at various levels, and it was suggested that we could renew our relationship with the AIADMK,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Sarathkumar said even though DMDK leader and actor Vijayakant had joined the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) it is unlikely to make a difference for the front. \u201cEven if you put together the vote share of all the constituents of the front they cannot cross nine per cent. As people always prefer a stable and strong government their natural choice will be the AIADMK,\u201d he said.\n\nSenior AIADMK minister R. Vaithilingam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami were present when Mr. Sarathkumar met Ms. Jayalalithaa.\n\nNotably, senior ministers Panneerselvam and Natham R. Viswanathan, who had played a major role during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, were absent.",
