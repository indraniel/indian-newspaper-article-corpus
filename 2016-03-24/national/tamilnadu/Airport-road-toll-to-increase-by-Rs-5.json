    "text": "Taxi and car owners will be spared an increase in the toll collected at Devanahalli plaza but other vehicle users will have to pay Rs. 5 extra from April as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has approved the hike sought by the concessionaire.\n\nLast year, the fare went up by Rs. 5 for all classes of vehicles. However, this year, NHAI has decided to increase the toll across classes exempting only car, jeep, van or the light motor vehicle category for which the current toll is Rs. 120 for the return trip.\n\nIn 2014, a massive increase in toll attracted the ire of thousands of users (it was increased from Rs. 30 to Rs. 75 for a single trip). The fare for a round trip was hiked from Rs. 75 to Rs. 115. Taxi owners were eventually forced to pass on the increase to customers.\n\n\u201cThe increase in toll is calculated based on Wholesale Price Index. Keeping this in mind, we have approved a price hike of Rs. 5 for categories other than cars,\u201d an NHAI official said.\n\nLight commercial vehicles, light goods vehicles and mini buses will have to pay Rs. 125 for a single journey and Rs. 185 for return. Buses and trucks will have to pay Rs. 370 for a return trip. The hike is effective from April 1.",
