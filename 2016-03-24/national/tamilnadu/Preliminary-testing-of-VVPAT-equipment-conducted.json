    "text": "Preliminary testing of the Voters Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines that is proposed to be used for Krishnagiri constituency here was conducted by election officials.\n\nVVPAT as a verifiable system enables voters to verify their cast vote and prevent fraud is being introduced in select 17 Assembly constituencies in the forthcoming Assembly elections here. About 299 polling booths are designated to use the VVPAT system, which provides voter feedback on the vote cast, and as proof of vote for a candidate to prevent potential tampering.\n\nKrishnagiri Assembly constituency is among the 17 constituencies in the State. About 351 VVPAT systems have arrived here from Bihar for use. The VVPAT machine will be placed adjacent to the EVMs, and once the vote is cast, a paper slip of the vote cast would be generated. However, the slip would not be issued, but instead, the voter may view on an electronic screen the vote cast as intended.\n\nEarlier, in a bid to verify the operational credibility of the VVPAT machines, preliminary vetting of the machines was undertaken here. The administration has taken up extensive demonstration of the system for the public here in public places.",
