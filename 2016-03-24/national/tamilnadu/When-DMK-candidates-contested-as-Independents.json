    "text": ": In 1957 when the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) entered the electoral fray for the first time, its candidates contested as independent candidates as the party was not officially recognised by the Election Commission of India. Interestingly, some of the candidates had to seek votes on free symbols individually allotted to them.\n\nThe party founder C.N. Annadurai had fielded candidates in 112 Assembly constituencies and 11 Lok Sabha constituencies. Prominent among those who entered the fray were Annadurai in Kancheepuram; V. R. Nedunchezhian in Salem-I; M. Karunanidhi in Kulithalai; K. Anbazhagan in Egmore; N. V. Natarajan in Basin Bridge; A. V. P. Asaithambi in Thousand Lights; P. U. Shanmugam in Tiruvannamalai; noted lyricist Kannadasan in Tirukottiyur; actor S. S. Rajendran in Theni; and Sathiyavani Muthu in Perambur (Reserved constituency).\n\nThe party had made a request to the Election Commission to allot the \u2018Rising Sun\u2019, an independent symbol then, to all its candidates. But the Election Commission expressed its inability to oblige. However, it assured to allot the \u2018Rising Symbol\u2019 to DMK candidates wherever it was not demanded by other independents.\n\nAs such, a majority of the DMK candidates got the \u2018Rising Sun\u2019 symbol. A few DMK men got other symbols. Nedunchezhian was allotted the \u2018Rooster\u2019 symbol.\n\nThe DMK candidates faced many handicaps -- not having intimate knowledge of the constituencies and their voting behaviour, very little experience in campaigning, lack of resources and absence of an uniform election symbol. But the party managed to get 15 of its candidates elected including Messrs. Annadurai, Karunanidhi, Anbazhagan, Sathiyavani Muthu, Asaithambi, P. U. Shanmugam and M.P. Subramaniam (who later joined the Congress and became the TNCC president).\n\nNedunchezhian lost to a Congress candidate in Salem I seat by a mere 207 votes. Poet Kannadasan, S. S. Rajendran and Anbil Dharmalingam were the other notable DMK leaders who suffered a defeat.\n\nThe DMK won three seats in Chennai district, four seats each in South Arcot and North Arcot districts, two in Salem district, and one seat each in Tiruchi and Chengalpattu districts.\n\nTwo DMK leaders \u2013 E. V. K. Sampath and Dharmalingam \u2013 were elected to the Lok Sabha. Anna was elected as the DMK Legislature Party leader, K. Anbazhagan as his deputy and M. Karunanidhi as party whip.",
