Selvakumar, a research scholar in textile technology, has all that he wants for his academic pursuit at the PSG College of Technology Centre of Excellence for Industrial Textiles. The Rs. 28-crore facility is also the sought after facility for not only many research scholars like him but also undergraduate and post graudate students.\n\nIn the absence of the centre, he would be travelling to different corners of the country just to carryout one or two experiments. But the centre had ensured that he gets all machinery and support under one roof, says Mr. Selvakumar adding that for this reason the centre has been attracting students, researchers from other parts of the country.\n\nThe Head of the Department, Textile Technology, PSG College of Technology, G. Thilagavathi says that the centre has students and researchers from Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and other parts of the country. The Centre also gets students, who, sometimes undergo workshops.\n\nForge Accelerator recently began operations at the Kumaraguru College of Technology Tech Park. Promoted by the Sakthi Group and supported by the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Development Board, the innovation accelerator is planning to attract engineers and students from the area and also across the country to help them convert their ideas into proof of products and proof of business, says vice president Vishwanath Sahasranamam.\n\nSoon the centre will be reaching out to engineering graduates and also students from other disciplines in the area. It will support them with hardware and software so that they come up with innovative products and a good business plan.\n\nAcademics say such centres will boost the city, an education hub, by drawing talents from far and wide.\n\nKarthik Madhavan",
