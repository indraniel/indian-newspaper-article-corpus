    "text": "Star Vijay\u2019s popular reality television show, Super Singer, which completed nine seasons a few days ago, was trending on social media for all the wrong reasons. The channel has been accused of \u201chiding information about the participant\u201d to the audience after details emerged post the awards ceremony that the winner, Anand Aravindakshan, was already a \u2018playback singer\u2019.\n\nIt emerged that Anand Aravindakshan had already rendered a few songs in Tamil movies. Since the show has a reputation of finding new singing talent and giving them the exposure and platform to shine, social media users were critical of the channel not being upfront about the fact that a professional singer had participated in the show and accused the channel of wrongdoing.\n\nActor and filmmaker Lakshmi Ramakrishnan, whose film \u2018Aarohanam\u2019 features a song sung by Anand Aravindakshan, wrote on Facebook saying that \u2018this cannot have happened without the channel\u2019s knowledge\u2019.\n\n\u201cUnethical practices have resulted in victimising not just Anand, but other participants and, of course, the audience, who spend time and money by sending SMS to support talented youngster,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhen asked for his comment, Pradeep Milroy Peter, creative head, Star Vijay, said that there was \u2018no rule that playback singers should not compete\u2019 in the show. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why everyone is talking about this. In the first few years, we had the rule. But we don\u2019t have such a rule anymore. We get hundreds of applications from those who have religious songs, chorus and tracks for films, released single albums. We cannot eliminate all of them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven those who have sung for movies have lost. Take for instance, Latha Krishna who has sung songs in Malayalam and for James Vasanthan,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics point out this year\u2019s winner is already a professional singer",
