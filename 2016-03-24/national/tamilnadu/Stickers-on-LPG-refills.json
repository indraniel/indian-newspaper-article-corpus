    "text": "With the Election Commission targeting cent per cent polling in the Assembly elections, district authorities here are pulling all the stops to reach out to the voters to persuade them to exercise their franchise without fail.\n\nAlongside a series of awareness initiatives, officials are trying to reach out to the 5.57 lakh LPG consumers in the district through the refills supplied to them. LPG refills supplied to the consumers till the elections will carry awareness stickers on the importance of voters to exercise their franchise.\n\nStickers carrying messages such as \u201cIs your family 100 per cent ready to vote?\u201d are being pasted on the LPG cylinders that would be supplied to the consumers. Collector K.S.Palanisamy inaugurated the process of sticking the pamphlets on LPG cylinders at an assembly of LPG suppliers at the Uzhavar Sandhai grounds in the city on Wednesday. In a press release issued later, Mr.Palanisamy said the Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) was under way. Screening of short films, signature campaign and awareness rallies were also under way across the district. In the latest initiative, stickers to sensitise voters were being pasted on the refills supplied by the Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation. On an average, about 11,400 LPG refills were being supplied by these three agencies in the district every day.",
