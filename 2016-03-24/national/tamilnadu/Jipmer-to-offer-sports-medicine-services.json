    "text": "Jipmer, an institute of national importance under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, will now offer sports medicine and arthroscopy (key-hole surgery) services through a special clinic.\n\nThe clinic, which began functioning on Tuesday, will function on the afternoon of the fourth Tuesday of every month at the outpatient department of Orthopedics from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nPatients suffering various injuries and ailments of knee, shoulder, elbow sustained by people participating in recreational and professional sports will benefit from the clinic.\n\nScreening of patients\n\nInformation regarding physical fitness and prevention of injuries will be emphasised. The clinic will also screen patients requiring arthroscopic surgery.\n\nArthroscopic surgery involves visualising, diagnosis and treatment of problems within a joint using a tiny camera. This operation requires very small incisions (key-hole surgery) which helps the patient recover almost immediately from surgery, doctors said.\n\nTreatable disorders\n\nExamples of disorders that can be treated by an arthroscope include repair of tears of the ligaments of the knee, removal of loose fragments within the joint or correction of recurrent dislocations of shoulder, a JIPMER press note said.\n\nJIPMER has a state-of-the-art armamentarium to successfully perform these complex surgeries and a dedicated physical medicine and rehabilitation department for sustained physiotherapy required after such operations, it added.",
