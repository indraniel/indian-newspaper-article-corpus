Then, a team headed by Mylapore crime inspector Tamilazhagan was formed. They studied the CCTV footage in and around the temple for many days,\u201d said a senior police officer.\n\nAfter careful scrutiny, they found that it was a team of juveniles who committed the crime.\n\n\u201cThey used to mainly target those who keep their mobile phones in their shirt pockets. The children, carrying a newspaper, would stand in the queue with the adults. Then they would keep fanning the paper from behind and quietly steal the phone,\u201d said a senior police officer.\n\nThe police then posed as devotees and identified the juveniles.\n\n\u201cWhen we asked them, they pointed at a man who was standing a few hundred meters away. They said he was also from Jharkhand. However, the man has been eluding us,\u201d added the officer.\n\nThe police have sent the boys to a home in Royapuram.\n\n\u201cWe have special juvenile police units and apart from this, one policeman has been allotted to each station to handle juvenile cases. We have tied up with NGOs to identify and rescue children who are brought to the city from other States and pushed into crime,\u201d said the police officer.\n\nMeanwhile, child rights activists say that many runaway children from places like West Bengal, Tripura and Mizoram are rescued when they arrive in the city.\n\n\u201cThey are brought here for domestic work. However, such children can also be pulled into the world of crime,\u201d said an activist.\n\nSpecial team studied CCTV footage in and around a temple\n\nin Mylapore",
