    "text": "Five years after the nuclear disaster of Fukushima Daiichi, survivors recalled the calamity and said that countries must be cautious in setting up nuclear power plants.\n\nEmiko Fujioka, Secretary General of Fukushima Beacon for Global Citizens Network, along with two other residents of Fukushima, had come to the city to highlight the magnitude of the meltdown. .\n\n\u201cThe meltdown was the result of the negligence of the government, who should have considered all safety precautions while setting up the plant,\u201d said Masami Yoshizawa, a cattle rancher pointing to photographs where over lakhs of men, women and children had to flee the city through the mountains.\n\n\u201cEven the mountains are now contaminated and you cannot enter inside,\u201d he said. 1,64,224 people were evacuated from Fukushima one year after the disaster and 1,01,282 more left in four years. Members of 80 families among those that stayed back, committed suicide.\n\n\u201cA family of three who used to grow apples committed suicide a year after the accident, as they couldn\u2019t leave behind the life they built here,\u201d said Mizuho Sugeno, an organic farmer and president of Seeds of Hope.\n\n\u201cOur fields have become toxic and our cattle have died we have been subjected to radiation in our bodies and go for check-ups to ensure it is minimal,\u201d said Masami. \u201cIt\u2019s every country\u2019s responsibility to take steps to ensure the safety of their citizens,\u201d she said.",
