The work on the construction of four stations \u2014 AG-DMS, Teynampet, Nandanam and Saidapet\u2014 started in December last year and the contractor L&T has been in the process of completing various levels like surface, platform and concourse, inside the stations.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the surface level of the stations has been completed and the work on the next level will be taken up.\n\n\u201cWe hope to complete the work as soon as possible,\u201d an official said. But commuters have to grapple with traffic on this stretch for another one-and-half years for it may take that long for the work to be complete.\n\nThis construction of underground stations along Anna Salai has run into several problems ever since it began.\n\nInitially, Gammon India and Russian firm Mosmetrostroy were awarded a contract for Rs. 1, 947 crore for the construction of seven underground stations along Anna Salai. But CMRL had issued show cause notices during the course of the project for the delay in completing the work.\n\nBut Mosmetrostroy suddenly abandoned the project in May last year owing to a severe financial crunch.",
