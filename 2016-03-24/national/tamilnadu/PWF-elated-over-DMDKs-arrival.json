Now that an alliance has been struck by our leader, we are happy about it,\u201d said a party aspirant for the Tiruchi West Assembly constituency who did not want to be identified.\n\nFor the four constituents of the PWF, the alliance has definitely come as morale booster. The parties, especially the Left parties, appear to the confident about their prospects in the Central region, where they hold pockets of influence.\n\nThe two Left parties have substantial presence in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts. The CPI (M), which contested the 2011 elections as part of the AIADMK combine, won from the Kilvelur (SC) constituency and the CPI from the Thiruthuraipoondi (SC) constituency in the delta region.\n\nIn 2006, the Left parties, which were then part of the DMK alliance, had won from Nagapattinam (CPI-M), Thiruthuraipoondi, Mannargudi, Nannilam and Alangudi (all CPI) in the central districts. The VCK had finished second in Sirkali in the previous two elections. The DMDK which went it alone then, had finished third in most of the constituencies across the Central region. The party candidates had polled over 10,000 votes in the six of the nine Assembly seats in Tiruchi district. The MDMK also has scattered pockets of influence, especially in Karur and Tiruchi districts. Apart from their combined strength, office-bearers of the PWF partners believe, that they would be able to swing the neutral votes in their favour as Captain Vijayakant Front projects a \u201cviable and formidable\u201d alliance this time.\n\n\u201cThe parties together have substantial presence in many of the constituencies across the region. Apart from this, we will garner the support of neutral voters, who are a decisive factor,\u201d said S.Sridhar, State committee member, CPI (M). People who were looking for an alternative to the two Dravidian majors did not have a viable alternative all these years. \u201cIn fact, the two Dravidian parties have been winning alternatively only with the help of negative votes,\u201d he said.\n\nSome feel that the front could now be projected as a mega alliance and winning combination. \u201cPeople are definitely looking for an alternative and we will now provide it with a strong front,\u201d observed K.Suresh, Tiruchi City Secretary, CPI.",
