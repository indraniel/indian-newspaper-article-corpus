    "text": "Government Rajaji Hospital administration is mulling over buying new models of battery-operated cars as the two battery cars bought recently at a cost of more than Rs. 10 lakh for use by patients have proved unusable within the campus due to their size and design.\n\nOfficials at GRH said that the campus is smaller with congested lanes for using the battery cars in an effective manner. One of the cars has space to keep a stretcher while the other car, which is relatively smaller, has seats to carry three to four people.\n\n\u201cMoreover, we are also finding it difficult to use the cars on ramps,\u201d said a senior official at GRH, adding that the same model of cars have proven immensely useful on big campuses like Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital.\n\nRecently, the hospital administration came under criticism for not using the vehicles despite investing a huge sum of money, which could have been otherwise used for improving other infrastructure in the hospital.\n\nAfter the complaints, the administration has instructed the employees to use the cars at least during night time. \u201cWe also need to keep the cars in use so that the batteries do not get damaged,\u201d the official said.\n\nHospital authorities said that they are planning to handover the two cars to the Government Hospital for Thoracic Medicine at Thoppur, which has a sprawling campus.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, some of the banks have approached us to donate battery operated cars as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. We have asked the company which supplied the first two cars if the design can be altered to suit the GRH campus. If they provide an alternative, we will go for it,\u201d the official said.",
