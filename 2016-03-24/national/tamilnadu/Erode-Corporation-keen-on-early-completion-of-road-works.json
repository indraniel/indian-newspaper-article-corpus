GOVARTHAN\n\nThe City Corporation is reportedly keen on completing the on-going process of re-laying damaged roads at the earliest, possibly in a month\u2019s time.\n\nRuling party councillors are believed to have exerted pressure on the civic body to complete the works since opposition parties have been using the issue as a handle to assail the civic body.\n\nThe roads that were dug up for laying pipelines for underground drainage witnessed severe damage during the rainy season.\n\nFunds crunch\n\nThe Corporation could not take up the works immediately at that point of time for two reasons: there was no funds and even if the road were to be laid during the rainy season, it was bound to cave in.\n\nFortunately for the civic body, the start of the summer season coincided with the sanction of Rs. 86 crore by the State Government for the purpose of re-laying the roads along with construction of storm-water drains.\n\nThe Corporation has taken up 48 road works in the four zones, requiring relaying to a cumulative length of over 100 km. The works were first initiated at Kumalankuttai, Soorampatti, Bus Stand, Molapalayam, Theeran Chinnamalai Street, Netaji Nagar, Eashwaran Kovil-Thiruvenkatasamy Kovil street junction, Karunkalpalayam police station road, and Sriram Nagar.\n\nIt is now nearly a month since the works commenced and there are visible signs of progress. According to Corporation sources, a momentum has been generated and the works will be completed in all probability in a month\u2019s time.",
