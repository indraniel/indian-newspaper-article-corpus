Sabapathy to expeditiously take action against AINRC MLA P. Angalane who switched loyalty to the Congress.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Wednesday, R. Viswanathan, convenor of PWF said the Rangasamy headed AINRC government had lost majority. The strength of the party has now come down from 15 to 14 with the defection of Mr. Angalane to the Congress.\n\nMr. Rangasamy has already lost the confidence of the people and should not face the Assembly elections as Chief Minister.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor A.K. Singh should also immediately intervene and take action against Mr. Angalane under the provisions of the anti-defection law.\n\nThe practice of defection in Puducherry has its origin in 1955 and it has been replicated by the Congress and various other political parties.\n\nMr. Viswanathan said that seat sharing talks between the constituents of the PWF in the Union Territory was going on smoothly. It is not proper to announce the Chief Minister before elections in a democracy.",
