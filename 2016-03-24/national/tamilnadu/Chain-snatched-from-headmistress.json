Thamaraiselvi (46), the headmistress of a Panchayat Union Primary School in Angappankottam village, was returning home with her husband V. Ovireddy (55) when the incident happened.\n\nA three-member gang, of which two were hiding their faces with handkerchiefs, coming in a motorbike in the opposite direction threw a plastic bottle at Mr. Ovireddy. As he stopped to question the three men, they took a turn and came near his bike.\n\nOne of the men allegedly sprayed alcohol from a bottle on Ms. Thamaraiselvi\u2019s face while another attacked Mr. Ovireddy with a knife. Fearing for her husband\u2019s life, Ms. Thamaraiselvi gave away the gold chain weighing 6.25 sovereigns. The gang also took a cell phone from the couple and sped away.\n\nThe Vadipatti police have registered a case in this regard.",
