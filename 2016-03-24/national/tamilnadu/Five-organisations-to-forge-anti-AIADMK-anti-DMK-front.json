    "text": "A five-organisation front from Coimbatore will strive to forge an anti-AIADMK, anti-DMK coalition, said the front leaders.\n\nAddressing journalists in Coimbatore on Wednesday, they said that Kongunadu Jananayaka Katchi, Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam, non-partisan Farmers\u2019 Association, Nermai Makkal Iyakkam and Akhila Bharatha Brahmanar Sangam had come together to bring together parties that were opposed to the AIADMK and the DMK.\n\nWith the objective of opposing the two Dravidian parties, the five-organisation front was talking to political parties to bring them on a common platform. If it let the opportunity miss, there was every possibility that either the AIADMK or DMK would return to power.\n\nThe front leaders felt that DMDK joining the People\u2019s Welfare Front would serve no purpose and that the Front would not be able to win the election.",
