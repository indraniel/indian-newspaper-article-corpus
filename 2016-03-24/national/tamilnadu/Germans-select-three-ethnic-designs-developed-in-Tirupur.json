Sivasangavi, a post-raduate student, Laveena Elizabeth and L.Lavanya, both undergraduate students, all pursuing Apparel Fashion Design courses, are elated after the individual designs created by them were selected by the German firm.\n\n\u201cWe developed the designs inspired by ethnic wears and chose orange, red, maroon, and majenta. It took almost three months for us to come out with 113 designs,\u201d said Ms. Sivasangavi.\n\nThe students\u2019 joy doubled as the German firm will give credit to the designers in the product catalogue used for promotion of the products.\n\nAlready, the company has been giving attribution to the efforts of under privileged women who were employed at the company\u2019s production unit based in New Delhi by attaching a tag with the apparels that tells that the products are made by under privileged women.",
