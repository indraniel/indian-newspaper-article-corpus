When the AIADMK cadres stopped his car a few yards before the venue, the DMDK cadres congregated on the road and vociferously protested the action of the AIADMK cadres.\n\nThe situation turned worse when both the party cadres got ready for a clash with each other on the road. Road users and shopkeepers were in the grip of fear. Meanwhile, police officials pacified the party men and allowed the DMDK party functionary to leave the spot. Later, the members of the DMDK and its allies celebrated the formation of an alliance.",
