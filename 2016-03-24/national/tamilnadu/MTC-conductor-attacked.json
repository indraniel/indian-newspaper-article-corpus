Unions complain that there are specific routes on which the bus crew are often attacked. According to the police, Ponnusamy (25) works as conductor on MTC bus route 44C plying between High Court and Indian Oil Corporation. On Tuesday night, when the bus reached Tondiarpet, three passengers hopped onto the footboard.\n\n\u201cSince they did not have tickets, an argument broke out between the conductor and the passengers. When they got down, they slashed Ponnusamy\u2019s left shoulder with a blade,\u201d said a police officer. Ponnusamy was rushed to Stanley Medical College Hospital. A complaint has been lodged with Tondiarpet police station.\n\nA week ago, Thiruvengdam, an MTC bus conductor, was attacked by a passenger with a knife at Pallavaram bus stop.",
