    "text": "A group of organisations working for the rights of sexual and gender minorities are requesting all political parties to give opportunities to members from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities in the upcoming Assembly elections.\n\nThe group held a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting the Election Commission to reserve seats for these communities to ensure representation of their needs. When such representation is available, it will give them an opportunity to improve their status as well as participate in serving others in society,\u201d said A. J. Hariharan, founder-secretary, Indian Community Welfare Organisation.\n\nJaya, general manager, Sahodaran, said a few transwomen had already applied with their parties \u2014 Ragasiya with the DMK, Radhika with the DMDK and Sudha with the AIADMK.\n\nOne other transwoman, Devi, had been nominated from Naam Thamizhar Katchi, she said. \u201cEvery leading political party should nominate at least one person from the LGBTQ community,\u201d she said.\n\nEven today, there is no clear statistical data on the number of transgenders in Tamil Nadu, which makes it very difficult to develop policies for their benefit.\n\nAmong the 14 organisations that are behind this request are Nirangal, South India AIDS Action Programme and SAATHI.",
