    "text": "The Federation of Bar Associations of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have withdrawn the proposed boycott on Thursday in view of a request/direction made by the Bar Council of India (BCI).\n\nThe federation had decided to boycott the courts in protest against non-consideration of advocates practising in lower courts for appointment as judges of High Courts. Declaring the boycott as illegal and unwarranted, the Bar Council of India issued a communication to the State Bar Council and the Federation requesting / directing to withdraw the boycott. In the communication sent by J.R. Sharma, Additional Secretary of BCI, it was explained that the issue raised by the association has been argued before the Supreme Court during the hearing of the National Judicial Appointment Commission case by the Chairman of the BCI.\n\n\u201cBut from the judgment delivered by the apex court, it could be found that the suggestions were not entertained. Even the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) drafted by the Centre the issue does not find a place,\u201d the BCI said.\n\nStating that the issue is beyond the jurisdiction of any particular High Court or its collegium, the BCI said, \u201cUnder these circumstances the call for boycott is totally illegal and baseless.\u201d\n\nConfirming the decision to withdraw the boycott, P. Paramasivam, Chairman of the Federation said, \u201cWe are not aware that this subject matter had been decided by the Supreme Court. The Federation was not a party before the Supreme Court in that case. Only after the Federation issued a boycott call, the BCI has brought to our knowledge that the issue was argued before the Supreme Court and the plea was rejected. Therefore, the only option available to us is to move a review plea before the Supreme Court.\u201d",
