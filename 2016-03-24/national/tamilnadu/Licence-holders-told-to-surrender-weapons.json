Rajesh on Wednesday asked the licence holders of arms and ammunition to surrender their weapons immediately as per the directions of the Election Commissions of India (ECI).\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of bankers and election officials held here, he said since the code of conduct was in force in the run up to the State elections all licence holders had been asked to surrender their weapons at their respective police stations.\n\nOut of 453 licence holders, 333 persons had surrendered their weapons. Twenty six licences had been issued to the persons in the name of various banks so as to provide security to their respective premises.\n\nHence, they had been given exemption. If any banker wanted special permission to provide security at ATMs or bank premises, they should apply fresh.\n\nOthers should surrender the weapons immediately. Otherwise, tough action would be taken against those keeping weapons illegally.",
