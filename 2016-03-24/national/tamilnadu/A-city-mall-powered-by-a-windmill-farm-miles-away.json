This is also the peak season when the mall attracts a large number of visitors, added the spokesperson.\n\nAn official of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) said the accounting system in cases where a company is located at one place and the windmill at another, involves deducting the energy consumed from the energy injected into the electricity grid and the remaining amount of energy units would have to be paid for by the consumer.",
