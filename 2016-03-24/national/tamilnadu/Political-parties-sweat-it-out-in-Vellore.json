MANINATHAN\n\nPolitical parties are gearing up for the May 16 Assembly elections. With preparatory works under way, there is only one thing that is slowing them down \u2013 the scorching sun.\n\nWith the mercury hitting 41.1 degree Celsius on Tuesday, party cadres are dreading hotter days as their leaders hit the campaign ground and the polling date closes in.\n\nBut the searing heat has to be managed, as elections are something huge for them, a section of cadres said.\n\n\u201cWe do not want cadres to fall ill after working under such hot conditions. We want to protect them from the heat, and hence, have worked out a strategy for the summer. We have asked them to work from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and then conduct meetings from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.,\u201d A. Narayanan, district coordinator of People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) said.\n\nHe said Vellore was very hot this year when compared to last year.\n\n\u201cThe place is known for its searing heat level. It is difficult with temperature touching 40 degree Celsius in Vellore,\u201d he added. One cannot fail to see mirages on the highway due to the soaring temperatures.\n\nThe mirage formed on the highways make it look as though it is flooded.\n\nAn AIADMK party person said they carried bottles of water in their vehicles to prevent from getting dehydrated. \u201cWe also take fruits and fruit juices wherever we go. It helps in managing the heat,\u201d he said.\n\nSome representatives of political parties said they were mostly engaged in indoor works now.\n\n\u201cWe are carrying out basic works for the elections now. But the sun will be at its peak when the polling date closes in. In fact, the blistering \u2018Kathiri\u2019 is likely to set in by then. This will tend to slow down our works particularly after noon,\u201d A.P. Nandhakumar, secretary of DMK Vellore Central district.\n\nParty representatives also said that managing the heat in Vellore will be tough especially when campaigning begins after candidates are announced.\n\n\u201cEvery summer, political parties put up \u201cwater pandhals\u201d at key locations but this is not possible now due to the election model code of conduct. Instead, the district administration can make drinking water available for public at identified locations,\u201d Mr. Narayanan added.",
