Gee Mahendra\u2019s play \u2018Paritchaikku Neramachu\u2019 on Sunday.\n\nRecollecting his association with Mr. Mahendra, he said it was a challenge to stage a play. \u201cCinema is something we all see, but it takes a great deal to create and develop good art like Mr. Mahendra does,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Mahendra said Rahman is a genius and an exceptional human being. \u201cHe has come all the way from Los Angeles just for the play,\u201d he added. He said there is no dearth of good theatre artists in the State and people should come to watch good plays. Both a stage and cine actor, Mr. Mahendra noted how important rehearsals are for cinema. \u201cBack then, actors used to rehearse for films at least for a month,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Paritchaikku Neramachu\u2019\u2014 that tells a touching story about the bond between a father and his son\u2014 by United Amateur Artists Troupe, was staged back in 1978 and then later made into a film with Sivaji Ganesan in the lead and Mr. Mahendra playing the role of his son (Varadhu Kutty).\n\n\u201cSivaji sir is like my father. Every minute I spent with him was a learning process,\u201d he added.",
