Greater Chennai Corporation has created bays for buses, carving out land from a park at the intersection of Dr. Besant Road and Kamarar Salai. \u201cThe bay will also ease congestion on Kamarajar Salai. New pavements and bus shelters will improve conditions for pedestrians,\u201d said an official.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted a study of the roads and designed the bays. The design will actually address the concern of some who feel that the speed of buses would reduce because of the bus bays,\u201d said an official. \u201cWe have done a study on six places. We require six to seven grounds. But acquisition is a problem,\u201d the official said.\n\nMost of the work on 300 heritage pillars, each 1.2-metre tall, has been completed. Most of the eyesores near heritage buildings along the Marina beach have been cleared out for the project. The work started in 2014 and was delayed because of fund crunch, causing hindrances to pedestrians last year. The heritage pillars have been designed to replace existing walls of various institutions to improve the aesthetics along the Marina beach.\n\nThe civic body also started improving the greenery along the beach with introduction of new species of plants. \u201cThe selection of species was made to withstand dry spells also. The conditions may improve this summer,\u201d said an official.\n\nProject includes restoration of greenery, completion of heritage pillars, wider pavements and new bus shelters",
