The victims Devasri (9) and Rajasri (6), siblings, drowned in a pond in Avalakampatty village here in Pochmapalli late Sunday afternoon. The children, daughters of Rajaram and Ambika, were alone at home when they decided to go to a nearby pond to watch ducks, with the children in their neighbourhood. The sisters had stepped into the waters, and were caught under the swamp. The girls drowned, before the other children could fetch help. Rajaram left for the Sunday market with his 5-year-old son. Pochmapalli police have registered a case. The bodies have been recovered.",
