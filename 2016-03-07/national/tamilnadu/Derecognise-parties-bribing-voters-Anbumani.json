    "text": "PMK chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss has called for amending laws to derecognise political parties caught bribing voters or indulging in electoral malpractices.\n\n\u201cPresently, the Election Commission could only register a case against those luring voters with money or freebies. It should consider disqualifying candidates on whose behalf the voters were enticed. Further the recognition of such parties must be withdrawn,\u201d he told journalists late on Saturday.\n\nInsisting that the PMK would succeed on its own in theelections, he said it was wrong to believe that the outcome of polls depended on arithmetic or vote bank strength alone.\n\n\u201cIf the PMK could get more than five per cent of votes polled in 2011 Assembly elections by contesting in 30 seats, it could very well poll 30 percent of votes if it were to contest in all the 234 seats,\u201d he contended.",
