After being given first aid at the local government hospital, she was admitted to a hospital in Madurai. Intra-party rivalry is believed to be the cause for the double murder.\n\nMr. Nagarajan, who was the former AIADMK secretary of Nattarasankottai town panchayat, had enmity with the incumbent, Ravi, as the deceased continued to command power in the party.",
