They have been noticed by music director Anirudh Ravichander and director Gautham Vasudev Menon on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cFor musicians who are just starting out and wanting to make a mark, taking up popular songs and coming up with their own versions resonate better with a larger audience as they listen to something familiar but with unique touches. While the focus used to be only on audio, many musicians are coming up with innovative videos as well,\u201d said Sudharshan Ashok.\n\nFollowing the popularity of their covers online, the group will be seen performing in Kappa TV\u2019s Music Mojo programme.\n\nVideo games, a serious hobby for many youth\n\n\u201cAfter coming back from work, the first thing I do is play games on my computer. And this lasts for several hours usually. But, it can vary everyday depending on the work pressure,\u201d says R. Sharath, a software professional.\n\nAnd he is not alone. Video and PC gaming continues to be a rage among the youth in the city for the last few years.\n\n\u201cEarlier, we used to play Mario and Dave on the computer, but ever since we have been introduced to playstations and other games, we are stuck to it,\u201d says A. Arvind, a school student.\n\nWorld of warcraft, defense of the ancients, counter strike, star wars: the old republic are among thousands of games that are popular among the youth.\n\nWhile some play it for fun, there are those who take it rather seriously.\n\n\u201cWe make it a point to attend international symposiums and lectures on gaming, as it has in a way helped us latch on to the gaming mindset,\u201d adds Aravind. Blur, FunMax, Gyspsy are some of the gaming centres frequented by enthusiasts. Despite the common notion about virtual gaming and its vices, youth continue to play undeterred.\n\n\u201cIt does tend to get very addictive but one must know where to stop,\u201d says R Karthik, an engineering student.\n\n(Reporting by S.
