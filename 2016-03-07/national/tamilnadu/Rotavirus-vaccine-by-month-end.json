    "text": "The Indian Council of Medical Research will be launching the rotavirus vaccine through the national immunisation programme by the month-end, said Sowmya Swaminathan, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research.\n\nThe vaccine will be initially provided to all children in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Odisha and Himachal and later expanded across the country. ICMR would soon be undertaking the first phase of trial of malaria vaccine, she told the medical graduants of Bharath University, urging them to come up with strategies and research programmes. The challenges in India were different from the West and hence the Western ideas could not be copied here, she pointed out. We need to step up treatment options for malaria, tuberculosis, kala azar \u2013 diseases that the West did not have to worry about, she said at the University\u2019s convocation on Sunday.\n\nIt was imperative to bring about basic behavioural change in the citizens, and make them seek preventive check up.",
