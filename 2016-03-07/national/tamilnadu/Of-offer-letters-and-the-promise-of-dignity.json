M. Moorthy\n\nIt was a great day for Preethi* as she landed a job at a private firm.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much getting this job offer means to me,\u201d said a teary-eyed Preethi, who fled her village in Kerala after the mysterious death of her close friend, who was also a transgender.\n\n\u201cSince then, life has been a struggle. I did every job that a transgender does in this big city. It broke my spirit, but now, I\u2019m looking forward to a great beginning,\u201d said Preethi, who along with nine other transgenders from across the city, have been offered jobs at private firms.\n\nThe nine were selected from over 300 transgenders who attended a job fair, conducted last month by the police, exclusively for the community. \u201cAs of now, they have got jobs, but we are in talks with other employers to ensure more opportunities for them. As a matter of fact, following the fair, several employers have been calling us to find out if they could recruit them,\u201d said Shobana Ramesh, vice-president of Bharathi Foundation, while handing out offer letters to the selected candidates at St Anthony\u2019s centre on Friday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Shyamala Devi, Additional Superintendent of Police, CCB, said the job fair had helped ease the tension between police and transgenders.\n\nOf the 20 transgenders who assembled at the venue, three received loan sanctions. Sujatha received a loan sanction of Rs. 3 lakh, which she had been struggling to get for many years. She\u2019s now ready to open her own catering business. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true. I will make the best use of this opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nSenior advocate R. Gandhi and S. Ramachandran, Regional Joint Director, Department Of Industries And Commerce, were also present at the event.\n\n*Name changed on request\n\nNine transgenders, who got jobs at a fair organised by the police last month, look forward to new beginnings",
