This test is done to analyse the depth of sand, and how thick or loose it is,\u201d the scientist said.\n\nThe scientist added that it would take at least a week\u2019s time to complete this process. Later, the sample would be sent for laboratory test.\n\nEstimated cost\n\nThe beach restoration project estimated to cost Rs 30-35 crore would place the submerged structure at a distance of 400 metres from the sea behind the Gandhi Statue by shipping sand from the harbour.\n\nThis triangular structure would reduce wave activity and prevent erosion along the coastline.\n\nFor a continuous stretch\n\nOnce it is completed the city will be able to have a continuous stretch of the sandy beach.\n\nThe harbour built in 1986 has already eroded an estimated 10km of sand beach and continue to erode the beaches along Tamil Nadu coastline.\n\nThis project is expected to restore the sand beach that Puducherry lost due to erosion. The scientist added that the project is expected to complete by May 2017.\n\nSand depth would be analysed to finalise the design of beach restoration structure",
