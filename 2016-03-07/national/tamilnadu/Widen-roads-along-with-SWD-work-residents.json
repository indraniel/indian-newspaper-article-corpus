An elaborate network of stormwater drains, estimated to cost over Rs. 5 crore, is likely to be completed in the next two months.\n\nSome of the roads that would get the drains are situated in wards 17, 19, 21 and 39, officials said. While the project was welcomed, residents are irked that this work, that ought to have been completed ahead of last year\u2019s monsoon, is only getting started now.\n\nRoad widening sought\n\n\u201cIt takes more than half-an-hour to reach Tambaram railway station from Camp Road. The work could have been taken up before the monsoon. Because of rains, it has been left-midway. Every day during rush hour, traffic on the stretch between these two places moves at a snail\u2019s pace,\u201d B.V. Saravanan, a resident of Rajakilpakkam, said, adding that the road along this stretch needs to be widened.
