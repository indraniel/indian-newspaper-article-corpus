    "text": "A leopardess, aged about nine years, was found dead inside a bush near Mavallam beat of Hasanur division on Saturday.\n\nA forest team retrieved the carcass of the carnivore from a metal wire trap kept by farmers for capturing hares and wild boars. Forest Veterinary Surgeon Manoharan carried out post-mortem on the spot in the presence of the District Forest Officer of Hasanur Division C.H. Padma, Range Officer Palanichamy and Village Forest Committee president of Mavallam. The carcass was burnt there after the post-mortem.\n\nAccording to the DFO, the animal appeared to have died of strangulation caused when it had struggled to free itself. The advanced age of the animal was indicative of its search for easy prey close to a water stream. There was no farm in the vicinity and the trap had probably been kept to trap hares or boars for meat by locals. A case has been registered and investigation was in progress, Ms. Padma said.",
