    "text": "Passengers who visit the computerised reservation centre to book tickets for long-distance trains at Moore Market Complex (MMC) suffer as they cannot easily secure photocopies of important documents.\n\nPassengers, especially those who visit the MMC for booking tickets in bulk, have to produce photocopies of a proof of their identity and those who do not have it ready have to walk to the commercial complex in Lily Pond. Worst affected are the differently abled and senior citizens, they complain.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is aware of the requirements at the time of booking. There are several counters, but people who visit the centre for the first time have to shuttle from one spot to another searching for the right one \u2014 for instance, booking a Tatkal ticket using cash or debit cards,\u201d said C. Niranjan of Odisha. At the debit card counter on the second floor, only certain cards are accepted, he said.\n\n\u201cIf people come in groups, one of them can stand in the queue, while others can help in getting forms, but how about a senior citizen or a differently abled person who comes alone. There are elevators, but they will find it very difficult to visit the photocopying centre and come back to the ticket counter,\u201d said S. Bharat, a Central government employee, who too was searching for a photocopying centre.\n\n\u2018Not feasible\u2019\n\nHe suggested that Southern Railway open a photocopying unit on the first or ground floor of the building. Southern Railway officials, however, said that the demand on the part of commuters for taking copies of documents was not high enough and that opening an outlet might not be feasible.",
