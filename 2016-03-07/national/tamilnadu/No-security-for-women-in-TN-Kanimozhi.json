Stalin on Sunday said that the women folk would unseat the AIADMK regime in the Assembly elections.\n\nSpeaking at the DMK\u2019s women\u2019s wing meeting held here, he said that the people, irrespective of caste, religion and gender, have been literally waging a war to vote out the \u201canti-democratic and anti-people\u201d and \u201cunpopular\u201d government in the State elections. The time had come for them to register their anger by exercising their democratic right.\n\nCalling for an open debate with any Minister, he said Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had totally failed to implement the electoral promises made when she sought votes in the last Assembly elections.\n\nMost of her announcements were still on paper. She had announced the scheme of providing mobile phones to the Self Help Group members. But, it took about five months to start the scheme.\n\nListing out the failures of the government during the last five years, he said the State financial position had taken a severe hit due to the mismanagement and maladministration. When Jayalalithaa took over the reigns five years ago, it was said that the total debt of the State government was hovering around Rs.91,000 crore. But, it has multiplied. The irony was that she had laid foundation stones a few days ago for various schemes to the tune of Rs.15,198 crore. Where the Government would find resources for the schemes when the State was facing financial crunch, he asked.\n\nDMK MP, M.K. Kanimozhi, who presided, charged that the crime against women had seen dramatic increase in the AIADMK government. More than 21,000 cases of crime against women had been registered in the State during the last five years, she claimed. There was no security for women in the State. The rulers had failed to ensure equality, dignity and freedom of women. It could not even ensure equal wages for women workers. A large number of women employees were retrenched due to the closure of various companies in the State.\n\nThe women\u2019s wing members of the DMK should meet at least 10 persons a day to highlight the misrule of AIADMK so as to usher in a women-friendly government.\n\nA large number of women from different parts of the State participated in the meeting. K.N. Nehru, DMK Tiruchi District secretary, spoke.",
