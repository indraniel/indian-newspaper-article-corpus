    "text": "Mutharaiyar Ezhuchi Sangam seeks adequate representation to its community\n\nMutharaiyar Ezhuchi Sangam (MES) has demanded the political parties that members from Mutharaiyar community be fielded in 23 assembly constituencies, where they are a majority, in the upcoming assembly elections.\n\nAddressing media here on Sunday, MES president B. Maaran alleged that major political parties have thus far failed to provide adequate representation to their community.\n\n\u201cOur support will only be for those parties that field our community candidates and provide assurance to meet our key demands,\u201d he said.\n\nClaiming that Mutharaiyars are a majority in 27 constituencies, Mr. Maaran said they have stuck to 23 constituencies as the remaining four are reserved.\n\nMr. Maaran said that their key demands included the proper assessment of Mutharaiyar community population in the State. \u201cWhile government reports say that our population is around 15 lakh. Our independent estimates show that our population is much higher,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\u201cMany of the sub-sects that go by different community names have not been counted as Mutharaiyars. Even majority of the fishermen in Rameshwaram belong to our community,\u201d he claimed.\n\nMr. Maaran said that their other key demands included representation of Mutharaiyar community in important posts like vice-chancellors of universities, recommendation of two advocates from their community for the post of judges in Madras High Court.",
