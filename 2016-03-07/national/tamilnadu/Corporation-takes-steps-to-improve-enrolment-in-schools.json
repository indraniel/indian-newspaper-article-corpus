We have been doing our best to ensure that we enrol every child of school-going age,\u201d said an official at the Corporation.\n\nAccording to the figures for the academic year 2015-16, 84,573 students were enrolled in Corporation schools, about 3,000 more than the previous year. About enrolment at Chennai schools, C. Muniappan, Principal of Chennai Boys Higher Secondary School in Nungambakkam, said the situation had improved considerably in the last few years. He said they had also been holding regular interactions with parents of children waiting to join schools. The parents are briefed about facilities available in the school. \u201cThe main focus is on girl students. We have regular counselling sessions for them. We ensure that they do not leave school midway due to family pressures,\u201d another official said. There is also an effort to enhance the quality of education. Novel initiatives, like the Pudumai Palli project, supported by British Council, trained 22 teachers from 70 senior secondary Corporation schools in English.",
