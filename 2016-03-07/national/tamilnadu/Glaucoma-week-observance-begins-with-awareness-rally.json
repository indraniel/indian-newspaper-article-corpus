Shanmugasundaram flagged off the rally and the participants covered the Race Course holding placards.\n\nMore than 75 doctors and nursing student volunteers participated in the rally that was aimed at educating the public about the cause of blindness. Stress was on regular and comprehensive eye check ups, especially after the age of 40 years.\n\nCSOS president Davdutt Thomas said that glaucoma was the second common cause of blindness, after cataract. \u201cIt is irreversible but preventable,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, 93 per cent of glaucoma patients are unaware of the disease as there are no obvious symptoms in the early stages, due to which it is referred to as \u2018silent thief of sight\u2019.",
