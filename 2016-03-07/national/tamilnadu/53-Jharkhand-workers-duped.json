    "text": "Fifty three workers, including 19 women and children, from Jharkhand who were brought to work in a clove farm near Kulasekaram in Kanyakumari district were duped by their agent. They were brought here by the agent two months ago with the promise that they would get good wages at the farm.\n\nThe agent, Goutham from Bihar, brought them to work in a farm in Balamore near Kulasekaram for plucking cloves on an hourly wages basis.\n\nGowtham left the workers at Nagercoil railway junction on Saturday afternoon after promising them to get their wages from the farm owner but did not return till evening.\n\nIt is suspected that Gowtham took Rs. 3 lakh from the farm owner and escaped.\n\nOn receiving information about the stranded workers, a local agent, Chellathurai, who had liaised with Gowtham to bring the workers, rushed to the railway station. He held talks with the workers and the estate owner and managed to get them Rs. 1,000 each along with the ticket for their travel to their native place. They left for Thiruvananthapuram on a train to catch a connecting train to Jharkhand on Saturday evening, police sources here said.\n\nNo case was registered since the workers did not lodge a complaint with the Boothapandi police station. The workers were advised to approach their agent in Bihar to get their wages due to them, sources here said.",
