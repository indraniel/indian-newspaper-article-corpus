Two of Andal\u2019s lyrics \u201cMen nadai annam\u201d, the fifth pasuram from Nachiar Thirumozhi, and \u201cThoomani madathu\u201d, the ninth one from Thiruppavai, came next. The well-liked \u201cRamanukku mannan\u201d by Arunachala Kavi in \u2018Hindolam\u2019 was well appreciated.\n\nAn old favourite, Papavinasa Mudaliyar\u2019s, \u201cNadamaadi thirindha\u201d in \u2018Kambodhi\u2019 was the main song. The singer\u2019s earnest attempt of raga alapana, neraval of the phrase \u201cThiruneerai sumandheero\u201d, the support from accompanists, R. Govindarajan on the violin and K. Thiagarajan on the mridangam, all contributed to a satisfying presentation.\n\nKathadi Ramamoorthy\u2019s comedy, \u201cWhatsapp Vasu\u201d, a fun and fantasy mix, wherein clicking a link on Whatsapp transforms a young man into an unrecognisable version of himself. It is entertaining to watch two men play the same character.\n\nThe setting of the play is a middle class family, with a typically old fashioned father, prudent and conventional mother, cranky relatives and the young son, a workaholic working on a high pressure, hi- tech job and his Whatsapp friend. Although some of the characters are stereotypical, the acting skills of the troupe keep the pace of the play going. The characters also surprise their viewers by their quickness in changing costumes.\n\nThe play tries to draw a parallel between a devise driven lifestyle, whereby people shop, queue, listen to music, watch movies and read books without having to leave their seats, and a leisurely life from long ago, in which people gossiped while they stood in actual queues, went to theatre to watch movies and concerts and moved around physically to play games.\n\nWritten, scripted and directed by S.L. Naanu, the play provided light-hearted fun poked at the obsession of today\u2019s generation with devises and applications.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
