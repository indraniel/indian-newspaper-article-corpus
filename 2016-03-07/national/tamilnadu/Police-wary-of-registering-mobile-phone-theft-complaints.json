Riaz Basha wanted to lodge a \u2018mobile phone stolen\u2019 complaint with the Government Railway Police (GRP).\n\nHe however found to his dismay that he could file only a \u2018mobile phone missing\u2019 complaint.\n\nMany claim that this is not an issue with the GRP alone.\n\n\u2018Mobile phone stolen\u2019 cases are often not registered as such at most police stations.\n\nRiaz Basha, a resident of Royapuram, works as a designer at a software firm in Taramani.\n\n\u201cEvery day, he parks his motorbike at the Beach railway station and takes the Mass Rapid Transit System train (MRTS) to Taramani. On February 26, he was travelling by an MRTS train and sitting in a seat near the door. Another person was sitting opposite him,\u201d said Sajith Basha, his brother and an advocate at the Madras High Court.\n\n\u2018Phone missing\u2019\n\nWhen the train moved out of the Light House railway station, the stranger snatched Riaz\u2019s phone and jumped off the train.\n\n\u201cMy brother could not follow him and he went to the Tiruvanmiyur police station to file a complaint with them. They, however, asked him to make a \u2018phone missing\u2019 instead of a \u2018phone stolen\u2019 complaint,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, a CSR copy was given to him on March 2.\n\n\u201cWhen Riaz asked the police officers why they did not want to register it as a theft, they said he would not be able to come for the identification parade. My brother also asked them if they could take out the CCTV footage from the station, but the officer said there was no camera,\u201d Sajith added.\n\nAccording to a senior GRP officer, the policemen have been instructed to take the complaint as it is and then determine through investigation if the phone has been stolen or missing.\n\n\u201cWe will look into the issue,\u201d said another officer.\n\nMany instances\n\nMeanwhile, this seems to have been the experience of many of those whose mobile phones have been stolen in the city.\n\n\u201cThe policemen do not wish to register it as stolen as they have to show recovery or else it will be a black mark for them. I know a few people who have undergone a similar experience,\u201d said V.S. Suresh, a Madras High Court advocate.\n\nVictims say that police often encourage\n\nthem to file \u2018mobile phone missing\u2019 complaints",
