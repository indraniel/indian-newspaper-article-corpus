    "text": "DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Sunday said party leader M. Karunanidhi would reveal the details about the DMK\u2019s electoral alliance at an appropriate time and urged the media not to speculate.\n\n\u201cIt is my humble request. Do not speculate and undermine our efforts to forge an alliance,\u201d Mr. Stalin told reporters at the Chennai Airport while leaving for Tiruchi to participate in international women\u2019s day celebrations.\n\nHe said interviews with aspiring DMK candidates would be over only on Monday; after that Mr Karunanidhi would hold talks with prospective alliance partners and make a formal announcement on the composition of alliance.\n\nMr. Stalin said his party had made representation to the Election Commission (EC) about the poll code violations of the ruling AIADMK.\n\n\u201cThe EC had promised to take action. If it fails to act on our complaints, we will take legal recourse,\u201d he said.",
