Namburajan said \u201cWhile persons with disabilities can become judges, civil servants and go on to hold high positions of the State machinery, how can they discriminate people based on disability? There are visually challenged teachers too. This notification is only an attempt to restrict differently abled persons. This notification is certainly a violation of the Act.\u201d",
