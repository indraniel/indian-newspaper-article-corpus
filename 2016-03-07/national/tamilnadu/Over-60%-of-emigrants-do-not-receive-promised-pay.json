PRABHU\n\n28-year-old Thavarimuthu was leading a hand-to-mouth existence in his village near Tiruchi, when a lucrative job offer came his way.\n\n\u201cI was told by a friend that a manufacturing company in Qatar was looking for welders, and it offered a good salary. And, I went for it,\u201d said Thavarimuthu.\n\nToday, Thavarimuthu is without a passport and a job, and he did not receive much money either. \u201cI got my salary only for the first two months,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is not alone \u2014 there are many other migrant workers who are facing a similar situation.\n\nAccording to a special study conducted among return emigrants by Centre for Development Studies, as part of the Tamil Nadu Migrant Survey 2015, 60.1 per cent respondents reported that they had not received the promised salary. Out of the total number, 39.1 percent were women.\n\nPamphlets\n\n\u201cWe have given out pamphlets with full instructions and precautions, we also have interactions, but somehow, many continue to get entangled and duped by unregistered agents and employers abroad,\u201d said a senior official from the Commissionerate of R\u00e9habilitation & Welfare of Non-r\u00e9sident Tamils.\n\nSimilarly, 32 per cent had problems in receiving their regular wage \u2013 it was either delayed or denied.\n\nHowever, 91 per cent of both men and women did not approach the Indian Embassy in the countries where they faced problems.\n\n\u201cOnce, my colleague in Saudi Arabia objected to the irregular payment. The employer got together a few men and they beat him up. He was later jailed for causing brawls. We all remained silent and accepted whatever paltry sum we received. They seized all our documents and threatened to jail us. It\u2019s not easy to seek help,\u201d recalled Raja. UAE and Saudi Arabia have received 4 and 3.5 lakh workers respectively.\n\nUnited States of America, the most sought-after destination for high-skilled emigrants, has 3 lakh natives of the State.\n\n\u201cIn the case of employment in the Gulf countries, most agents do not even have the exact job information and are not even registered with the commissionerate. Hence, the workers get duped,\u201d said Josephine Valarmathi from National Domestic Workers Movement (NDWM).\n\nShe also emphasized the need to have a policy or an Act that secures the monetary and social security of workers abroad.\n\n\u201cThe current Emigration Act provides no such security, we desperately need an improved bill as our country does not supply cheap labour,\u201d she said.",
