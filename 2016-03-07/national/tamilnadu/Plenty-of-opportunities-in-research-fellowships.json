Venkateswarlu, Principal Scientist, Material Science Division, CSIR \u2013 National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore, has said that there are plenty of opportunities in research and fellowships, and called upon fresh graduates to open their spectrum instead of being narrow minded.\n\n\u201cOpen your spectrum and grab the opportunities,\u201d he said, delivering the 14th graduation day address at Syed Ammal Engineering College here on Sunday. He advised the students to visit places wherever there were opportunities, both in India and abroad, to take up research and higher studies.\n\nFellowships were available in many spheres, but there were not enough applicants, he said, adding details of research programmes and fellowships all over the world could be accessed by a touch of a button and the students, especially those who aspired for higher studies, should explore and grab the opportunities. Finance for higher studies and research programmes was no more a constraint as research institutions and government undertakings offered scholarships. Indian scientist C.N.R. Rao, who had produced more than 100 Ph.D. scholars, was a shining example for winning awards for research programmes, he said.\n\nThe graduates could also take a cue from the biography of Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. Marie Curie was prohibited from continuing her studies after standard V, but overcame all hurdles to win the Nobel Prize twice, he said.\n\nAs nothing came free, the graduates should have a clear perspective in their chosen field and work hard to scale greater heights in life, he said.",
