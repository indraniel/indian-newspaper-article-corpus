    "text": "The public in Erode city will keenly look forward to the shaping up of the flyover project at the GH Junction during 2016.\n\nFortunately, for votaries of infrastructure development, there has been some progress. There was an apprehension that the project initiated at the start of 2014 would be put on hold indefinitely in view of elections to State Assembly in the coming months. Relocation of statues of national leaders in recent weeks from the location that had been an impediment for project execution is a sure indication that the works involving Rs. 75 crore expenditure will progress henceforth at a fast pace, official sources say.\n\nAnother major work, the Ring Road project, is also being executed a little behind schedule due to problems involved in land acquisition. While the decks have been cleared for extending the link from Kokkarayanpettai in neighbouring Namakkal district to Thindal along Perundurai Road, connecting Modakurichi, Kangayam and Chennimalai Roads en route, the wholesome utility could be derived only if the Ring Road ends further beyond at Chithode along Sathyamangalam Road. An eagerly awaited project for years that has not taken off so far is the Rs. 400-crore Ooratchikottai scheme that would entirely solve the drinking water needs of the city. The Central Government is yet to sanction funds for the project. Another Central project in limbo is the Erode-Palani rail link planned as early as in pre-Independence years. For the textile sector, early fructification of the major subsidy-linked Common Effluent Treatment Plant project is desirable to ensure sustenance of operations.",
