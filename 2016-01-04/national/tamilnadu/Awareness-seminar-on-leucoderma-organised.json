Mahakrishnan, former Dean and HOD, Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital, said that the seminar had been organised to create awareness of vitiligo for the last 17 years, but still it was highly improbable for a patient to marry outside the fraternity of similarly affected persons.\n\nIn his felicitation address K. Umapathy, secretary, LAM, said that often relationship issues were among the most important social problems that spoilt the happiness of leucoderma patients.\n\nTo date, LAM-India had facilitated marriage of over 350 vitiligo couples at \u2018suyamvarams\u2019 held in Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore and Puducherry.\n\nA \u2018suyamvaram\u2019 for the leucoderma-afflicted persons would be held in Salem in February, he said.\n\nAccording to LAM-India, it is estimated that about two per cent of the people the world over have leucoderma.\n\nIn India, it is estimated that roughly four per cent have this disorder.\n\nPa. Devendra Bhupathy, Joint Commissioner Commercial Taxes (Enforcement), Tirunelveli Division, was the chief guest.\n\nDermatologists from neighbouring districts and people afflicted with leucoderma participated in the seminar.",
