Rajesh, All India president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India.\n\nTalking to press persons here on Sunday, he said that 43,000 government jobs were abolished across the country in the last three months. Over 11 lakh government posts were lying vacant for the last one year, and IT-related jobs were cut by five per cent. The BJP-led government at the Centre did not take any efforts to fill existing vacancies.\n\nJobs in rural areas too had come down sharply. The youth, from the professionally educated to the unskilled, were affected by the wrong policies of the Centre, he said.\n\nThe Centre had been relinquishing its social responsibility in health care and education with an aim of downsizing the government and restricting it to act as a monitoring mechanism.\n\nWith signing of GATT Agreement, higher education would not be accessible even to middle class, he claimed.\n\nStating that the Right to Education Act was blatantly violated by the State and the Central governments, Mr. Rajesh said that no private school implemented 25 per cent reservation for economically and socially weaker sections in admission.\n\nWith no heroes to follow, the BJP and the Sangh Parivars had now taken up the principles of Swami Vivekanandha and Mahatma Gandhi to divert the attention of the people, he charged.\n\nThe DYFI would organise cultural and social programmes to protect democracy, secularism and tolerance in the country from January 12 to 30, he added.",
