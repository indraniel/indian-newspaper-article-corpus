    "text": "A New Year invariably dawns with an array of personal aspirations. However, as citizens, each holds certain aspirations and dreams beyond the personal \u2013 dreams linked to one\u2019s own city or town.\n\nThe Hindu attempted to get the pulse of the people as to what they wanted for their towns and cities this New Year. \u201cHopefully a railway station that been in demand for more than three decades; and a medical college hospital. Genuine demands I suppose,\u201d quips Ashok, an advocate in Krishnagiri.\n\nFor V. Gnanashekaran, President of Hostia, a third SIPCOT industrial estate that will encourage major companies to locate their industrial units in Hosur will be a boon for the New Year. \u201cThere is an increase in the number of small scale units. But, there are only one or two major companies in Hosur. Also significantly, we need Hosur-Jholarpet railway link,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Dharmapuri district, industrialisation and end to migration are the key aspirations. \u201cIndustrialisation for the district is my dream for this district for this year,\u201d says V. Viswanathan, a CPI (M) activist. \u201cThere should be industrialisation that would curb outward migration. Until such time, there should special grant for the district as a backward region,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to Senthil, former MP, the district provides labourers for the entire state. \u201cLet 2016 be the year, when there would be no more out-migration. For this, we should improve agriculture and support industry.\u201d",
