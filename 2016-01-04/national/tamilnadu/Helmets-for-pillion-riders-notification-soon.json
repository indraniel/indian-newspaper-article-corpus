    "text": "This New Year may finally be the time for those who ride pillion to invest in a helmet. The government is expected to bring out a notification as early as next week, making it mandatory for pillion riders to wear helmets. This is months after the idea was first mooted.\n\nSources in the Transport Department said it is only a matter of time before the notification is out. It is already compulsory for two-wheeler riders to wear helmets.\n\nNo exceptions will be made, officials added. \u201cUnder Section 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, everyone is supposed to wear protective headgear. There is no specification of age or any other thing. There is no question of any exemptions to the rule,\u201d a senior official said, when asked about opposition to the proposed rule. There have been objections from regions with extreme temperatures in the summer.\n\n\u201cThe weather conditions in north India are worse. There will be no such exceptions. Death rates due to accidents have been rising, and two-wheelers are badly hit. While the riders are usually safe, the pillion riders have no protection. In about 10 to 15 days, hopefully, we will be able to implement the rule,\u201d he added.\n\nTransport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said the notification will be out \u201canytime soon\u201d, adding that he had approved of the proposal over a month ago.",
