Ponnuswamy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries\u2019 Association. Except for automobiles, MSMEs catering to the other sectors saw a drop in orders. Valve making units were hit by low international oil prices and steel sector was affected by lack of investment in infrastructure. Most of the MSMEs operated only 60 per cent to 70 per cent capacity. Hence, there were no new investments or expansion projects too, he said.\n\nLarge-scale private sector industries and public sector undertakings need to invest and increase orders for the MSMEs to do better. And, infrastructure projects should be expedited. \u201cWe need efforts that will bring back investments in the private sector here,\u201d he says. Sectors such as pumpsets have seen indications of revival in the last one month. Similarly, with the Government announcing the amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme, the textile sector hopes to see more investments soon.\n\n\u201cAll sectors of the industry should improve. Agriculture sector is expected to do good this year. This will revive the economy,\u201d says V. Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
