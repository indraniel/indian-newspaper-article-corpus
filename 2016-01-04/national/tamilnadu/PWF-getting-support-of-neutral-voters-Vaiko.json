    "text": "Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) general secretary Vaiko said that People Welfare Front (PWF) was emerging as a leading front in the run up to the Assembly elections.\n\nAddressing a meeting of cadre at Mannachanallur near here on Sunday, he said the AIADMK had lost the ground as it failed to deliver on all aspects of governance. The ruling government\u2019s inefficiency was clearly exposed in the aftermath of flood in Chennai. Thousands of people, who were badly affected by floods, were yet to be given relief package and rehabilitation, he charged.\n\nSimilarly, the DMK had also lost its credibility. The people had not forgotten the misrule of the DMK. It would not get the support of the people again. The PWF alone was enjoying a clean image. The neutral voters would definitely support the PWF. The popularity of the front was going up, said Mr. Vaiko, the co-ordinator of the front.",
