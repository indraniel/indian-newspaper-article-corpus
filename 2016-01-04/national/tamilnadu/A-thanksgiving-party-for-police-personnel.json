Anbhazhagan, a police officer attached to Kotturpuram police station in Chennai.\n\nResidents of Kotturpuram, Besant Nagar and nearby places, volunteers from AID India and over 40 students and teachers from Corporation schools in the locality thronged the station on Saturday evening to thank the police on their selfless efforts towards relief and rescue during the recent floods.\n\n\u201cVolunteers were greatly appreciated for the relief work, but not many came forward to thank the police. Over the past few weeks, we had been receiving requests from the residents to help them organise a surprise event to show their appreciation for the police,\u201d says P. Sakthivel, founder of 6.in, surprise party planners.\n\n\u201cWe held a music event for about an hour at the station, cut and distributed a cake that was sponsored by Cake Square and presented a shield of honour to Kotturpuram police. The students presented poetry and also gifted an artwork to them,\u201d he added.",
