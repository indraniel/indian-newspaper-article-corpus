The work remained suspended for about three weeks during the rains.\n\nOfficial sources said that the work has commenced, regaining momentum and is expected to be completed on an expeditious basis.\n\nAt present, the Nalan Kulam is being filled using water drawn from the borewell of the tank. After use by devotees, the tank is emptied only to be re-filled, indicating wastage of huge volume of groundwater. The treatment plant, with a capacity of handling 12 lakh litres, is being set up with a series of tanks to treat water through filtration. All the infrastructure, including the recycling tanks, have been brought to the Nalan Kulam. The tank is most utilised with a large congregation of devotees during Saturdays , necessitating the setting up of the recycling plant. On a few occasions, the water drawn ranges between 25 lakh litres and 40 lakh litres.\n\nWhile three tanks are uniform in size with 5.5 metres in diameter and six metres in height, the collection tank is fairly larger in size with 16 metres in diameter and four metres in height.\n\nExplaining the treatment process, the official said that the filtering process will be taken up in two phases \u2014 aeration filter and sand filter. While civil works have been completed, electrical works would be taken up in course of time, according to official sources. Being executed on an outlay of Rs. 2.14 crore under the Tirunallar Temple Town Development project, the works are expected to be completed in about six months.\n\nThe work was suspended for about three weeks during the\n\nrains last year",
