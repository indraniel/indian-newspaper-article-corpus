    "text": "Two transgenders and a car driver were arrested by the Cantonment crime police on the charge of robbing a businessman here in the late hours on Saturday.\n\nThe names of the accused were given as Priya (27), Sania (26), and car driver Govindaraj (30). They were apprehended by the police moments after they committed the crime.\n\nPolice sources said the complainant A. Raja (29) of Sengipatti in Thanjavur district engaged in rice business came to Tiruchi from Karur district in the late hours on his way home.\n\nWhile proceeding towards the central bus stand, Raja came across Govindaraj who reportedly told him that he was proceeding to Thanjavur in the car and that the latter could board the vehicle, the sources said.\n\nRaja boarded the car inside which Priya and Sania were seated. As the car reached Mannarpuram, one of the transgenders laid her hand on the gold chain worn by Raja.\n\nThe businessman, apparently annoyed at this, slapped the transgender\u2019s hand. The transgenders allegedly snatched the gold chain from Raja who got down midway.\n\nEven before the car sped away, Raja noted down the vehicle\u2019s registration number and informed the beat constables on duty at TVS Tollgate area. The Cantonment Crime police, who were alerted about this, intercepted the car and apprehended the accused.\n\nThe Cantonment Crime police booked a case under IPC section 392 (robbery) against the accused who were remanded in judicial custody. While Govindaraj was lodged in Tiruchi Central Prison, the transgenders were lodged in the Lalgudi sub jail, the sources said.",
