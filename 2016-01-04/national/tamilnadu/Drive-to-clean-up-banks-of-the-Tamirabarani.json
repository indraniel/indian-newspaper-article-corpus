    "text": "The Corporation authorities have launched a mission to clean up the banks of the Tamirabarani river here. Mayor of Corporation E. Buvaneshwari inaugurated the clean up drive.\n\nThe Mayor said the banks of the river would get a new look once the waste dumped on it were removed. Public meetings were convened on the river banks in those days, but now thorny bushes have encroached them.\n\nOver 50 sanitary workers were involved in removing the bushes on the banks, she said. Plastic wastes and other wastes got washed away and settled along the river banks.\n\nThe bountiful rain in Tirunelveli during the Northeast monsoon led to considerable storage of water in dams and other waterbodies. After the storage level in dams reached its maximum capacity, the surplus water was channelised into the Tamirabarani river. Around 40, 000 cusecs of surplus water was discharged from dams and let in to the river, which was the lifeline of farmers as well as common people, sources said.",
