    "text": "Though strategic location of Salem district, close to major markets, favours industrial investment, poor infrastructure continues to be a bottleneck for its development.\n\nKnown for mineral wealth, textiles, silver anklets, steel and sago units, the district with over 23,000 small, micro, medium and large scale industries contributes about 4.70 per cent of the States GDP. However, failure to upgrade industrial infrastructure, low level of service industry and inadequate cluster development approach continue to haunt the growth of the district that has population of over 32 lakh.\n\nFailure to consolidate the industries and tap export opportunities has made the industries dependent on domestic market. Traders have been seeking establishment of specialised clusters for overall growth.\n\nTraffic congestion, absence of ring roads, limited day-time rail connectivity to other major hubs and absence of air connectivity to metros, have all been a major problem in the district that remains unaddressed. Though Mettur Dam is located in the district, many villages lack drinking water facility and the need for interlinking of rivers in the district is imminent. City residents want the roads dug for various developmental works to be re-laid apart from establishing multi-level parking lots, bus terminals and long-term solution for solid waste management. Though flyovers have been proposed at various places in the city, these are yet to materialise even as vehicle population on the roads keeps increasing. The need for expanding the city limits with adequate infrastructure would pave for overall development.",
