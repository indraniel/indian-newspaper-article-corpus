Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers\u2019 Association. With more flights, Coimbatore will get investments in different sectors, including Information Technology.\n\nWith representatives of industrial associations meeting Union Government officials and Ministers, the industry here is hopeful of getting flight connectivity to destinations such as Dubai.\n\nThe district needs more investments in the private sector this year for revival, says president of Coimbatore District Small Industries\u2019 Association E.K. Ponnuswamy. When the Codissia Industrial Parks take off, there will be construction activities, creation of common infrastructure and capital investment too by the industries.\n\n\u201cWe need more such investments in the private sector,\u201d he says.\n\nSimilarly, sectors such as coir in Pollachi should be developed.\n\nAny industrial development in the nearby places will bring orders and business to micro, small and medium-scale enterprises in Coimbatore, he says. \u201cWe need to support industrial sectors that are doing well and promote their growth.\u201d",
