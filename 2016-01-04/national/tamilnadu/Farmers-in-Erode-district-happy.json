There is a huge possibility for a quantum jump in turmeric cultivation during the current year.\n\n\u201cWe expect the cultivation area to rise to 10,000 hectares this year,\u201d said Prabu, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said.\n\nBanking on the significant rise in groundwater level due to heavy rainfall from the monsoons, farmers have already started procuring seeds for planting during May.",
