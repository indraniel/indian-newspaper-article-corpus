They are now in the process of registering a company \u2013 Vellore Farmer Producer Company.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 350 farmers in our circle. Our aim is to promote scientific organic farming,\u201d D. Kumaran, a farmer in Mottupalayam, and chief executive officer of the to-be registered company said.\n\nThese farmers are cultivating crops on about 700 acres of land. Many crops such as paddy, chillies, brinjal, papaya, tomato, lady\u2019s finger, mangoes and turmeric are being raised organically.\n\nHe said Bangalore and Coimbatore based firms have been producing organic fertilisers for crops but not many farmers were aware of this.\n\n\u201cWe have purchased these fertilisers from the outlets, and have brought it to our field use. We will be distributing these organic fertilisers to farmers. This is to encourage them to take up organic farming and see its success,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that the shops were giving the organic fertilisers on 60 per cent discount. \u201cWe will keep five per cent of this for the company, and give back the 55 per cent to the farmers,\u201d Mr. Kumaran said.\n\nThese farmers were following both traditional and scientific organic farming, he said, adding, \u201cWe want farmers to see the success of following scientific organic farming.\u201d They will also train farmers in organic certification.",
