MC Saravanan, one of the coordinators of \u2018Vaa Nanba,\u2019 said that though majority of the statues were maintained properly after last year\u2019s clean-up, some were not. \u201cWhile posters were pasted on the pedestal of statues in places such as Kalavasal, there was wild growth of plants around some other statues,\u201d Mr. Saravanan said.\n\nThe cleanup exercise was carried out after obtaining permission from the Madurai Corporation. Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa inspected the cleanup activity and congratulated the volunteers. \u201c\u201dWe received full support from the sanitation department of the Corporation,\u201d Mr. Saravanan said.\n\nA team of more than 150 volunteers started the clean-up job in the morning, starting with the Tamil Annai statue in front of Tamukkam Grounds. Later, the volunteers split themselves into 12 teams and cleaned 12 statues across the city. They also a put up a small board near the statue with details of the scholars.\n\nA. Raguman, another key member of the group, said that they received an overwhelming response from volunteers for the statue cleanup exercise compared to their other weekly initiatives.\n\nTalking about the increasing participation of volunteers, Mr. Saravanan, however, said that funding remained an issue. \u201cFor instance, we have many saplings ready for planting. But buying tree guards for them is a problem with our shoestring budget of contributions from volunteers,\u201d he said.",
