On Saturday, burglars gained entry into the bank and attempted to break the locker.\n\nHowever, the siren link that is connected to the Omalur police station went on and police rushed to the bank. The bank officials were informed and the bank was opened on Sunday in the presence of the police. It was found that unidentified persons attempted to break the locker and also searched the manager\u2019s room. Since the locker could not be broken, the cash and jewellery were safe.",
