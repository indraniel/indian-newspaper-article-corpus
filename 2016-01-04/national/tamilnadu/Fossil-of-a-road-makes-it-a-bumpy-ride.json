VELANKANNI RAJ\n\nThe bad condition of the road between Kolakkanatham and Kolathur in Irur block in the district has been posing a great inconvenience to the road users, particularly agriculturists.\n\nThe road, to a length of about 15 km, forms a vital link not only for the agriculturists of the district but also to the traders of Tiruchi and Ariyalur district as it serves as a short route linking two National Highways \u2014 the Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway on the west and the Tiruchi-Chidambaram National Highway on the east.\n\nKunjithapatham, a cotton cultivator of Kaarai village, pointed out that the road should be properly re-laid. The quality of the road had got worsened during the sharp showers the village experienced last month.\n\nA cross-section of the people of the villages said the road was not motorable and a few spots had turned more accident-prone.\n\nA large number of tourists, particularly geologists and nature-lovers visit Kolakkanatham village, to have a glimpse of the fossils area popularly known as \u2018Kaarai fossils\u2019.\n\nManonmani, one of the residents of Kaarai, said the road leads from the Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway to the bird sanctuary at Karaivetti via Dhalavai, underlining the importance of improving it.",
