    "text": "Come January, truck loads of sugarcane start arriving in the city for Pongal. Another product in demand is mud pots.\n\nT. Sundarraj, who makes pots near Kavundampalayam and for whom business was passed down by his father, says the demand for pots goes up every year during Pongal. He sells pots to traders in flower market area, Mettupalayam, and even in other cities such as Karur.\n\nHe recently exported pots to Tamils settled in the U.S. \u201cThe photographs of pots in varying sizes were sent via WhatsApp and the orders were placed,\u201d he says. S. Ashok Raja, a dealer in pots in the city, says that he buys pots in bulk from various parts of the country including Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Sivaganga and Coimbatore. He stocks different varieties well before the Pongal season and supplies to corporate customers.\n\n\u201cAt least 50 corporate customers, including educational institutions, buy pots during Pongal for celebrations at offices and institutions,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to the customers\u2019 preference, the pots are painted in different colours. The pots absorb heat and retain it, so the rice will cook even at a low flame. The price of a pot ranges from Rs.60 to Rs.350.",
