    "text": "A drive on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) is not a pleasant experience as non-stop burning of garbage along the highway at many spots affects visibility and also causes irritation to many motorists.\n\nS. Anandan, a roadside vendor from Tirumudivakkam, said that several motorists witness the burning of garbage along the service roads of the Outer Ring Road. Their locality has, for a long time, remained largely neglected and even waste from industrial units are burned here, he added. He said vegetable and kitchen waste are dumped near the underpasses of the ORR.\n\n\u201cTirumudivakkam is not the only spot which is nauseating for passersby, there are several other stretches as well,\u201d he said. According to him, garbage dumping and subsequent burning has been taking place in this area for many years as a result of which even the wells here are contaminated.\n\nAccording to residents, garbage along Adyar River garbage is dumped by village panchayats of Kunrathur Panchayat Union.\n\nResidents have appealed to the Panchayat Union, District Rural Development Agency and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to intervene and stop the menace. But, in vain.\n\nOfficials of Kundrathur Panchayat Union said they were strictly adhering to court rulings, but miscreants set fire to the garbage along the road margins. They said they had instructed industrial units not to dump vegetable waste by the roadside. The industrial units have been instructed to wait for garbage trucks to dispose of waste.",
