Srinivasan\n\nThe Chennai floods seem to have taught the City police an important lesson \u2014 to improve their coordination with other agencies.\n\nThey are now creating a database of people who can help in rescue operations in case of an emergency. The police claim to have rescued several thousand people during the floods. Drones were also used to identify those stranded in different parts of the city, especially southern suburbs.\n\n\u201cOne major hurdle we faced was mobilising people and also the logistics to save the people. Hence, we are creating a database of swimmers, owners of boats, lorries and tractors and also non-governmental organisations, among others who can be contacted immediately during a disaster,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nThe police have taken this decision based on a feedback from residents.\n\n\u201cA major problem we faced was that we were unable to use boats in narrow lanes to resue people,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nThe police force in the southern part of the city prepared a database immediately after the November floods. \u201cWe collected the numbers of all boat-owners and swimmers in the coastal areas. This helped us a lot in December,\u201d added a police officer.\n\nSources also want the government to provide training to as many policemen as possible in swimming and rescue techniques.\n\n\u201cIt will be better if each station has a good swimmer who is an expert in diving and rescue,\u201d said an inspector.",
