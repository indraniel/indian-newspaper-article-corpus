LAKSHMI NARAYANAN\n\nThe students\u2019 wing of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) staged a demonstration in front of the collectorate here on Sunday to protest against the anti-students attitude of the AIADMK regime.\n\nThey raised slogans condemning the Government for opening IMFL shops near the educational institutions and demanding provision of educational scholarship regularly to the students.\n\nSecretary of the students\u2019 wing of the party Ila Pugazhendi led the agitation.\n\nKovi Sezhiyan, MLA and joint secretary of the students\u2019 wing, T. M. Selvaganapathi, former MP, R. Rajendran, secretary of the Salem central district unit of the DMK, and others spoke on the occasion.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Pugazhendi criticised the Jayalalithaa regime for its failure on all fronts. This is evident from the fact that about 85 lakh youth have enrolled their names with the employment exchanges. He called upon the students wing members to leave no stone unturned for bringing back DMK regime in the State in the 2016 Assembly elections.",
