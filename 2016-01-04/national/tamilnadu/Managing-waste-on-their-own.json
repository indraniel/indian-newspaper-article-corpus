Residency do not want to send any waste to the city\u2019s garbage dump. Nor do they want Coimbatore Corporation lorries to collect waste, says P.R. Pramod, a resident.\n\nThere is new waste collection initiative in the area that comes under Ward 57. To make it workable, the residents with support of Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (RAAC) have bought a battery-operated vehicle for Rs. 1.15 lakh to collect waste door-to-door.\n\nThe residents\u2019 association will collect waste only if it segregated, says R. Raveendran, honorary secretary, RAAC. To help the residents segregate waste, the association is distributing red and green bins and a bag.\n\nPeople will dump biohazardous waste in the red bin, and kitchen waste in the green bin and dry, recyclable waste in the bag. They will also hand over the waste in segregated fashion to the person collecting it.\n\nMr. Raveendran says that the vehicle makes garbage collection from the 250 houses in the area easier. Initially push carts were used to go door-to-door.\n\nThe residents will compost the wet waste in a vacant plot, to be sold as manure. They will sell the dry, recyclable waste to waste handlers for proper disposal.\n\nThe residents with help from \u2018Marumai\u2019, (a waste management initiative) have also opened kiosks to collect dry, recyclable waste.",
