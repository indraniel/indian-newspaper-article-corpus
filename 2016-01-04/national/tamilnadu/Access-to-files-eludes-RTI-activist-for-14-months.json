    "text": "He sought documents on transfer of 122-acre govt land in October 2014\n\nThe Revenue Department and the Tamil Nadu Archives have been passing the buck for over 14 months now over granting access to certain files and documents dealing with transfer of about 122-acre government land to a private hospital at Porur in 1995.\n\nV. Gopalakrishnan, a Chennai-based activist, approached the Revenue Department and sought copies of files under the Right To Information (RTI) Act in October 2014.\n\nThe department, however, directed him to approach the Archives Department saying files that were more than five years old would be maintained there. However, officials at the Archives informed Mr. Gopalakrishnan that two of the files were sent to the Revenue Department for reference in 2005 and they were never returned.\n\n\u201cThe Revenue Department, on its part, claimed that the \u2018RDC\u2019 Section under it which was supposed to have received the files never existed and hence it would not be able to provide copies of the files,\u201d says the activist. Not satisfied with the answers, the applicant had filed two appeals in the Tamil Nadu Information Commission.\n\nThe Commission said the PIO, the Assistant Commissioner of the Tamil Nadu Archives and the PIO of the Revenue Department should together look for the files and hand over a copy of them to the RTI applicant.\n\nFive villages\n\nThe 122-acre land spread across five villages are said to have been transferred to a private trust and when I seek the documents, the officials are not able to locate the documents except for one letter from Commissioner of Land Administration to Revenue Department,\u201d said Mr. Gopalakrishnan.\n\nIncidentally, in this letter sent in December 2014 the Commissioner had recommended that the purchase of a piece of land by a private trust in 1985 (in Porur) has to be considered \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201cimproper transactions in poromboke (tank bed) lands.\u201d\n\nBoth the Revenue and Archives Departments pass the buck over the \u2018missing documents\u2019",
