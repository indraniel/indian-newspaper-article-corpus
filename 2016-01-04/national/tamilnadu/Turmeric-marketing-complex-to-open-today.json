The complex has a transaction shed, office building, bank building, separate rest houses for traders and farmers, drying yard, weigh bridge, canteen, and huge parking space for vehicles.\n\nThe auction of turmeric will first be conducted at the new facility and then at Semmampalayam, which was hitherto managed by traders and would henceforth be administered by Regulated Market Committee.\n\nAbout 200 bags have already arrived at the complex, secretary of Erode Regulated Marketing Committee R.N.
