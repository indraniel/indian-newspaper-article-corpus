Students can also look for their textbooks, dictionaries at a cheaper price in these places.\n\nFifty-five year old S. Mani, one of the booksellers from Chennai brings hundreds of books every week to the Sunday Market.\n\n\u201cI bring at least four to five sacks of books to this market. This time, I got three sacks containing English books and one and half sacks of Tamil books,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has been selling second-hand books for the past 30 years on the Mount Road in Chennai. \u201cI started visiting Puducherry only 10 years back. I come here every Sunday in a private bus specially arranged for the traders who come here from Chennai,\u201d he says.\n\nValayapathi (53) from Ambattur in Chennai had incurred huge loss in his second-hand bookstall at Mount Road after the construction of Metro rail started. But he found a silver lining in the Sunday market.\n\n\u201cI work in a sugarcane juice shop in Chennai during the weekdays and come to Puducherry on Sunday to sell books. I get at least 500 to 750 books and we also have a godown here to store 40-50 sacks of books.\n\nThere is A. Idhurs (43), a bookseller from Chennai who sees a potential market on Sundays here. \u201cWe have organised a vehicle that would pick up and drop traders coming from Chennai,\u201d he says.\n\nWith a regular customer of more than 20 people, he earns Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 4,000 in a lean day. \u201cThe sales will go up when there are new books and we might earn between Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 9,000,\u201d says Idhurs.\n\nThe books sold here are affordable, which attracts more people.\n\n\u201cThere are Tamil books including interesting novels sold at a low cost. You can even negotiate the price. The cost of books range from Rs. 20 to Rs.100 or Rs.150 and these markets are a blessing for students who cannot afford expensive text books, says Sakthivel.M, a regular customer to these bookstalls.\n\nAt dusk on a Sunday, these booksellers pack up the unsold books only to return back the next Sunday.",
