    "text": "Though recent rains had cheered up farmers across the district, farmers at the foothills of Kolli Hills were dejected by the drop in production of areca nut (betel nut).\n\nThe crop is cultivated on about 900 acres in Vendangi, Karavalli and other areas at the foothills as favourable weather prevails over the year and also due to availability of water. The trees blossom in May and later the flowers grow as nuts and finally the harvest is done in December and January. Due to heavy rains in November and December, the nuts had withered leading to drop in production. The usual yield from a tree is about 40 to 50 kg in December and January.\n\nThis time, the yield had dropped to less than 35 kg, said T. Sakthivel, a farmer of Vendangi. He said that due to increase in production in other States, the price of areca nut had also reduced this year. \u201cUsually, it is sold for Rs. 200 per kg. But now it is around Rs. 150 to 170 per kg,\u201d he added.\n\nFarmers also said that fruit rot disease resulted in drop in production this year. The areca nuts that dropped prematurely from the trees cannot be sold in the market and hence it was a loss to us, said another farmer.\n\nMany said that after harvesting the nut, they would dry it, boil and roast it and sell in markets in Karnataka as they get reasonable price there.\n\nThey urged the government to fix reasonable price for the products so that they could continue with the farming. After planting saplings, nut bearing starts after five years and the number of harvests is usually thrice a year. Nuts from the tree are cultivated for about 23 years and later the trees are replaced with new saplings.",
