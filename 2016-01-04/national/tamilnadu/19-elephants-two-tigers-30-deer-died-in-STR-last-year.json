    "text": "Deaths of 19 elephants, two tigers, one leopard, one bear and about 30 deer have been reported in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve that encompasses Sathyamangalam and Hasanur Divisions, during 2015.\n\nEleven elephants in Sathyamangalam Division had reportedly died due to natural causes of old age or ailments.\n\nThe deaths of two tigers during January and December were suspected to be due to infighting.\n\nDecember-January is the mating season for tigers and infighting among males is quite a possibility during these months. Post-mortem of the carcasses in both cases revealed broken skulls, District Forest Officer of Sathy Division K. Rajkumar said.\n\nRoad kill\n\nAs for the spotted deer, road kill was the major reason. There have been 30 cases reported. The incidents have been reported mostly in the Mettupalayam-Bhavani Sagar and Sathy-Bannari stretches.\n\nThe deer move in herds and vehicles speeding past the road during night hours knock them down. The incidents come to light only after the break of dawn.\n\nOf the eight elephant casualties in Hasanur, two animals had died due to electrocution while they attempted to enter fenced farms.\n\nThe Forest Department has registered cases against the farm owners. Of the rest, three had died due to natural causes and the remaining three due to ailments, District Forest Officer of Hasanur Division C.H. Padma said.\n\nThe only death of leopard, an incident of road kill, was reported near the Hasanur Checkpost.\n\nThe accident prompted the Forest Department to install a number of barricades to check the speed of vehicles passing through the National Highway 209.\n\nThe deaths of tigers were suspected to be due to infighting",
