Though there are conflicting versions about the number of persons killed in the war, according to an estimate of the United Nations about 40,000 persons have been killed. S.C. Chandrahasan, Treasurer of Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR) said,\n\n\u201cThe government of India should come with a generous package to supplement the efforts of the Sri Lankan government in facilitating the return of the refugees.\u201d\n\nReferring to the recent developments in the island, including the release of over 700 acres of civil land so far under the control of the Army to the civilian authorities, Mr. Chandrahasan said this was the right time to encourage more refugees to return as most of the land owners are living in camps in India.\n\nOfERR has organised Skype meetings between refugees living in India and the returnees who went back to the island on how the situation has improved. \u201cTo make things easy for their return, ferry services must be recommenced, as that would also ease the financial burden on the aiding agencies in helping the return of refugees.\u201d\n\nThe government of Tamil Nadu, where over a lakh Lankan refugees are living in camps, has been sceptical of their return to Sri Lanka. In January last year, the then Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said that the conditions in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were \u201cstill not conducive\u201d for the refugees to return.\n\nAccording to an estimate of UN, about 40,000 persons were\n\nkilled in the war",
