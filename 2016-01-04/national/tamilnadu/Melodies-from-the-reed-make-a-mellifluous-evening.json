    "text": "Rasikas at Ragapriya spent a pleasant evening, regaled by flute music in Ramani\u2019s style, by his disciple Ajith Ranganathan.\n\nM. Vijay Ganesh supported him on violin while Ashwin Sridharan provided the beats on mridangam.\n\nAjith played the gentle tones of a Valaji varnam composed by Lalgudi, and then a few signature notes of goulai to preface \u2018Pranamamyaham\u2019 by Mysore Vasudevacharya and ended the song with kalpanaswarams.\n\nA taste of Dikshithar was offered through \u2018Kanchadalaya Dakshi\u2019 in kamalamanohari. Tyagaraja kritis included the pancharatnam in Sriragam, \u2018Entaro Mahanubhavulu,\u2019 \u2018Rama nee samanamevaro\u2019 in karaharapriya and \u2018Ninnadanela\u2019 in Kannada.\n\nSyama Sastri's \u2018Marivere\u2019 in Anandha Bhairavi provided a good interlude. The main song \u2018O Ranga Sayee\u2019 had the flautist and violinist use their creative skills in delineating Karaharapriya and display the variations of kaalams that the kriti lend itself to. The keen play of mridangam throughout the song and solo played later were appreciated by the listeners.\n\nA thillana in Nalina Kanthi by Ramani and Bharathi\u2019s \u2018Enna tavam seithanai\u2019 were the final songs, while the audience had expected to listen to at least a couple more of such simple and short renditions.\n\nAltogether it was a proud moment for the performers\u2019 teachers and well-wishers among those assembled there, for these musicians hail from Madurai.\n\nRAJALAKSHMI PADMANABHAN",
