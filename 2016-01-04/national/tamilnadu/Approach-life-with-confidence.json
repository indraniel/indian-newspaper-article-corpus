You are as talented as those studying in expensive schools. All that matters is perseverance and self-confidence,\u201d she said.\n\nFondly remembering the perseverance shown by the children of the SEED PLAN in inviting her for the function, Ms. Rohini asked the students to retain the same perseverance in their life.\n\nShe asked the children that they need not look at life as a competition with others but instead cooperate with others so that there was growth for everyone.
