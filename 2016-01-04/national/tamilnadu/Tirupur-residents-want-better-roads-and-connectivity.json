While the knitwear manufacturers are keen on getting the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime rolled out and look for government intervention to keep the raw material prices stable, among others, the public feel that industrial progress should not be at the expense of environment.\n\n\u201cDisasters like what happened in Chennai is a warning that floods caused by encroachments on water bodies can wash away any number of industrial units. So, the administration should ensure that textile units do not pollute. It should also construct enough storm water drains to take away rain/waste water from the city\u201d, said P. Somasundaram, secretary of Tirupur Consumer Voice.\n\nResidents by and large feel that the Corporation and district administration should focus on improving the road conditions and connectivity which, otherwise, not only causes hardships to the daily commuters but also would have a cascading effect on the export prowess of the Tirupur knitwear industry. Need for improving the frequency of drinking water supply and promptness in removal of garbage at the ward level are some of the expectations aired by the people.\n\nM. Veluswamy, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Tirupur district council), said skill development would be given more focus in 2016 and the years to come to generate adequate quantity of trained workforce to meet the growth projections of the exporting fraternity here.",
