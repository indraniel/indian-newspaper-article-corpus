Rajasekaran, was taken to New Delhi for a meeting with the Minister concerned.\n\nBJP contention unacceptable: Congress\n\nMeanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president E.V.K.S. Elangovan criticised the Centre for backtracking on its promise.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s contention that animal rights activists might oppose the move for not keeping up its promise cannot be accepted.
