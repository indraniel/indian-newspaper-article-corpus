The thieves get into the trains when they slow down or halt for a signal, snatch the chain or bag and flee. During night, some children climb onto the signals and snatch the phones of unsuspecting passengers,\u201d said a GRP officer.\n\nOnce the watchtower is inaugurated, personnel from the three departments will keep a vigil, in shifts. \u201cThe searchlights will be useful to check the movement of people at night. The shrubs along the tracks will also be cleared,\u201d added the officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the watchtowers, each of which is expected to be 12-ft high, will also be coming up at two entry points to the Chennai Central railway station. One of them will be set up near the entry point on Wall Tax Road, and the other near the entry point near Moore Market Complex. The railway officials have already inspected the sites,\u201d said the officer.\n\nThe personnel manning the towers will be armed. \u201cHaving guns will serve as a deterrent. It will also create a sense of security for the passengers. There are also plans to have a watchtower at Egmore,\u201d added the officer.\n\nPassengers too felt that watchtowers would be very useful.\n\n\u201cMore CCTV cameras should also be fixed on the station premises and monitored continuously. It is high time unobtrusive technology was adopted by law enforcement agencies,\u201d said K.S. Moideen, a frequent traveller.",
