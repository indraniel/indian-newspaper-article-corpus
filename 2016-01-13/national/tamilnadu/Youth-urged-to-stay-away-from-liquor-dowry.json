Shanmukanathan urged the youth to stay away from liquor and avoid demanding dowry as their contribution to the development of the country.\n\nAddressing the National Youth Day and Swami Vivekananda Birth Anniversary celebrations organised at the Sri Ramakrishna Mutt, Mr. Shanmukanathan welcomed the popular demand for prohibition in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHe said the youth should avoid drinking which was much more important than prohibition.\n\nSimilarly, he asked the youth to shun materialistic life and advised them to say no to dowry which, he said, was a major impediment for the marriage of girls from poor family.\n\nHe recalled an incident that led to a suicide in the family after the poor father could not raise huge money for paying dowry to his three daughters.\n\nPointing to the greater heights achieved by Indian youngsters like Sundar Pitchai of Google, Indira Nooyee of Pepsico and US Astronomer Kalpana Chawla, he said the youth should strike not only for their better prospects, but also work for the uplift of the country.\n\nYounger generation should help the nation fight poverty and hunger.\n\nSimple way of helping others would be through blood donation and eye donation, he said.\n\nReading at least one of the works on Vivekananda would make their life meaningful, he said.\n\nCash awards\n\nMr. Shanmukanathan also distributed certificates and cash awards to winners of essay competitions held for school and college students.\n\nHead of the Mutt Swami Kamalathmananda and professor of Sastra University R. Srinivasan were among those who spoke.",
