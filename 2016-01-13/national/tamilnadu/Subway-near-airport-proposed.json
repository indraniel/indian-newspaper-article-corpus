    "text": "Airports Authority of India has suggested to the Madurai district administration to construct a subway on the Inner Ring Road near Madurai Airport to avoid re-routing of the Uthangudi-Kappalur Road for the proposed extension of airport runway.\n\nMembers of Madurai Airport Advisory Committee were informed of this by Airport Director Kuldeep Singh Rishi at a recent meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have made the suggestion to Collector L. Subramanian. While the airport runway could be extended on the eastern side cutting the Ring Road, vehicles can be allowed below it through the subway,\u201d he said.\n\nThis would save the district administration re-routing of the Ring Road and acquisition of land for it, he said.\n\nWord of caution\n\nHowever, Mr. Rishi had a word of caution that the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had rejected one such proposal made for Visakhapattinam airport, he said.\n\nBut, one more such proposal for Varanasi airport was still pending. Mr. Rishi said that Madurai airport was waiting for the outcome of Varanasi airport proposal for processing its (Madurai airport) proposal, he also said.\n\nIf the subway proposal is approved by the BCAS, it will save the State government the efforts of acquiring some 94 acres of land for re-routing of the Ring Road from Mandela Nagar junction.\n\nThe delay in acquisition of land for re-routing of the Ring Road is also one of the reasons for not completing the process of acquiring 615 acres for airport expansion works.",
