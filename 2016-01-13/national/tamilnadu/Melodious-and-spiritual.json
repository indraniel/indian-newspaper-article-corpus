ASHOK\n\nBombay Jayashree's concert at the 64{+t}{+h}anniversary celebrations of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam on Monday began on a robust note with Palghat Parameshwara Iyer's Nattai raga varnam, \u201cSarasijanabha.\u201d Dikshithar's salutations to \u201cSri Varalakshmi\u201d in Sriragam came next and was presented with fast-paced Kalpana swarams at the end.\n\nShe also presented a surprisingly speedy alapana for Sahana, after which she brought out the predominantly karuna rasa in the song \u201cChittam Irangadho.\u201d The rarely sung Oormika raga kriti, \u201cEntani Vina\u201d by Pallavi Seshaiyyar came next.\n\nJayashree's choice of the main raga for alapana was Shankarabharanam and she built up an elaborate alapana with dedicated support from Embar Kannan on the violin for Thyagaraja's \u201cSwararaga Sudha.\u201d\n\nSumesh Narayanan on the mridangam performed a variety of beats during the tani with good partnership from Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira to win a big round of applause.\n\nJayashree then went on to sing ragam and tanam in Sumanasa Manjari and rasikas found both the singing and the violin play unique and engrossing. The singer sang several sangatis for the pallavi, \u201cMeenalochani Mam Pahi.\u201d\n\nShe concluded the concert with Chinnanjirukiliye and a tillana in Madhuvanthi. The listeners found her singing to be melodious, spiritual and restful.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
