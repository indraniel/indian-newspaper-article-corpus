    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday transferred investigation into death of J. Edwin Raj in a communal clash at Nadaikavu near Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district on August 26, 2012 from Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department to Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nJustice S. Vaidyanathan passed the order on a writ petition filed by P. Jeyarajan, father of the deceased, who alleged that the CB-CID had deleted the name of Bharatiya Janata Party leader C. Dharmaraj, the prime accused in the case, from the charge sheet due to political pressure and hence he had lost faith in the investigating agency.\n\nThe judge agreed with the petitioner\u2019s counsel, A. Velan, that the court could order transfer of investigation, even after filing of charge sheet, if it found that the investigation had not proceeded in the right direction. He said that though the murder had taken place as a result of a communal clash, there was no conspicuous change in investigation even after the CB-CID took up the probe.\n\n\u201cA perusal of a status report filed by the CB-CID reveals that the case has been proceeded with as that of a case of petty nature\u2026 and it casts a doubt on the mind of this court. The respondent has not taken any serious steps to unearth as to whether the first accused was present in the scene of occurrence.\n\n\u201cThey have come to the conclusion of the non-involvement of the first accused in the crime based on the deposition of some witnesses. It is the bounden duty of the respondent to ensure whether there is any conspiracy in the alleged occurrence and the absence of the first accused in the spot alone is not sufficient to delink him from the charges,\u201d the judge also said.",
