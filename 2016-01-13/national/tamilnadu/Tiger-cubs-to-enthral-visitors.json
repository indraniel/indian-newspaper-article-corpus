Krishnaswamy\n\nFour cubs of the six-year-old white tigress Namruta will make their first public appearance at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park soon.\n\nThe cubs, which were born to Namruta and Vijay, a 12-year-old Bengal tiger, on October 16 last, had been kept away from visitors all these months.\n\nThe tiger cubs are in a playful mood with their mother and are enjoying their stay in the new environment, says K.S.S.V.P. Reddy, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Zoo Director.\n\nOn December 13, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa named the two white male tiger cubs Devaa and Nakulaa. The two female cubs were named Kalaa and Maalaa.\n\nThey are Namruta\u2019s second set of cubs to be delivered. She had given birth to two male cubs at the breeding centre in the zoo earlier, officials said.\n\nEarlier, Akanshaa, another white tigress, delivered four orange-striped cubs, which were brought up by veterinarians and animal caretakers at the zoo.\n\nThe enclosure is being readied by zoo authorities near the tiger breeding centre, which is otherwise a prohibited area for visitors.\n\nThe enclosure was disinfected to avoid infections to the three-month-old cubs. They will be constantly monitored for their reaction to the new environment, zoo officials say.\n\nIt may be recalled that during the third week of December last, zoo authorities set up a 27-inch television set to enable visitors to have a glimpse of the four cubs.\n\nThe TV set has been attached to CCTV cameras fixed inside the separate enclosure. This arrangement will continue for sometime, the officials add.",
