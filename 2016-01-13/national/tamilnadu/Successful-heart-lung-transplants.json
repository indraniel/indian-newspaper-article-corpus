    "text": "A team of surgeons at Global Hospitals has successfully performed heart and lung transplants on two patients.\n\nKalyan, 42, from Andhra Pradesh, had end-stage lung disease that was a result of fibrosis of the lungs. It had affected the lungs\u2019 ability to expand, said Rahul Chandola, senior consultant, heart and lung transplant surgeon.\n\n\u201cHe also had a very high level of antibodies that could result in the rejection of the lungs, if the organ was transplanted. We had to take extra efforts during post-operative care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe surgeons said that in the case of Ramesh, a 43-year-old resident of Chennai who had severe heart failure, his condition had deteriorated to a stage where he had liver cirrhosis as well.\n\n\u201cHis chances of having a liver failure and inter-operative bleeding due to lack of clotting due to the condition of his liver were concerns. He was not able to breathe properly as well and many other healthcare centres had been hesitant to perform a transplant on him, given the risks involved,\u201d Dr. Rahul said.",
