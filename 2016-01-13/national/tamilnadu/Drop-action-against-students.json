    "text": "Students\u2019 Rights Retrieval Federation has urged the State Government to drop action against Law College students who had joined lawyers in the protest demanding Tamil as court language.\n\nThe federation\u2019s organiser M. Jagan told reporters here on Tuesday that following the protest in Madurai in September, six Madurai Law College students were placed under suspension.\n\nThe college had set up an inquiry committee to probe the matter, and there were enough reasons to believe that the students could be dismissed.\n\nThe State Government and the Law College administration should drop action against the students, and withdraw the proceedings against the lawyers who organised the protest.\n\nMr. Jagan said that the State Government should revive efforts to make Tamil the court language. It had earlier passed a resolution in the Assembly and sent it to the President for his assent. The President referred the matter to the Madras High Court, which was against the move.\n\nIn the interest of petitioners and lawyers, the government should take steps to make Tamil the court language, he said.",
