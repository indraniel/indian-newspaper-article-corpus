    "text": "Considering the urgency of the plea moved by the wife of an ailing man who is in \u2018coma\u2019 and the absence of any particular statutory provision for appointment of a guardian in such a situation, the Madras High Court has allowed the wife to deal with her husband\u2019s property and to operate his bank accounts.\n\nJustice M.M. Sundresh passed the unusual order on a petition moved by Sairabanu Mohammed Rafi pleading to appoint her as the guardian to sell her husband\u2019s properties and to use the proceeds for his medical treatment as he is bedridden and not is a position to take any decision on his own.\n\nReport submitted\n\nIn a recent hearing the court directed the tahsildar, Mayiladuthurai, to visit the residence of the petitioner, satisfy himself with the condition of her husband\n\nM. Mohamed Rafi and file a report.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing in the first week of January, the officer filed a report confirming the facts claimed by the petitioner along with a medical certificate issued by the Chief Civil Surgeon, Government Hospital, Mayiladuthurai.",
