The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority permits multi-storeyed buildings on Padi Kuppam Road which is more than 18 metres wide. The stretch has many bottlenecks, reducing the width beyond the standards set for multi-storeyed buildings.\n\nResidents say the Rail Nagar bridge across the Cooum should also be restored at the earliest",
