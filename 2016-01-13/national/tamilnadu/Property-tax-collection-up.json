    "text": "The Coimbatore Corporation has made progress in property tax collection this year. This year\u2019s collection as against last year\u2019s is up by 8 per cent, say sources.\n\nIn 2014, as of December 31, the corporation had collected 59 per cent of its then current demand. As of December 31, 2015, the collection stood at 67 per cent.\n\nThe sources say that though the collection had improved, it had not met the target the Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan had fixed \u2013 75 per cent by December 31.\n\nSources say that to improve the tax collection in the coming days, the corporation has asked bill collectors to go to wards where the top 100 high-value defaulters stayed.\n\nThe objective was to collect as much tax as possible before the announcement of election dates, when the bill collectors would get busy with electioneering. But the major problem the corporation was facing is bouncing of cheques given by tax payers. A good number of these cheques have bounced. The corporation is now planning legal action against them.\n\nOn Tuesday, the civic body held a meeting in this regard.\n\nTo improve tax collection, the corporation has initiated stringent measures like severing water supply connection to defaulters.\n\nIn the last few months alone, the civic body had severed 30 connections.\n\nIn the days to come, it plans to intensify the penal action.\n\nTo facilitate easy payment of tax, the corporation has added net banking facility for online payment, says Commissioner Vijayakarthikeyan. Until recently only those with debit or credit card could use the online payment facility.\n\nThe civic body hopes that this too will increase collection, he adds.",
