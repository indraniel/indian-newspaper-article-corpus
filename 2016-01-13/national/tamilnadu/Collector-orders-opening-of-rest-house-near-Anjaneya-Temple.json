    "text": "Collector V. Dakshinamoorthy has asked officials to open the rest house near the Anjaneya Temple for the benefit of the devotees.\n\nThousands of devotees throng the temple from various parts of the State and from nearby State everyday. Hence, two years ago, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) had constructed two rooms with air-cooling facility and two ordinary rooms. But the rooms were not opened for the devotees. Following complaints from the devotees, the Collector held inquiry with the HR and CE officials.\n\nOfficials said that the air conditioned installed in two rooms were not functioning. Hence, the rooms were not opened, they added. The Collector asked the officials to immediately repair the air-condition and also open the rest house for the benefit of the devotees. He also instructed the officials not to allow temple workers to use the rooms.\n\nThe Collector has also asked the officials to submit details of devotees using the facility everyday. Presently, in the absence of rooms near the temple, devotees have to reach the bus stand for rooms.",
