Periasamy\n\nArtisans from seven States are in the city displaying and selling their handmade products at Craft Bazaar, organised by Poompuhar, at Suguna Kalyana Mandapam.\n\nFrom tie & dye textile items to hand-crafted leather bags, the exhibition that has 60 stalls has it all.\n\nThe products on display include Thanjavur paintings, replica of Ravi Verma paintings on treated wood, leather wallets, products made out of banana fibre and silk cocoon, rose wood mandapams, kalamkari cloth bags and bronze artefacts.\n\nA guaranteed eye-catcher is the lampshade carved out of stone, which when lit, creates shadows of Indian deities.\n\nFor those who like trinkets and gemstones, there is a huge collection of artificial and semi precious jewellery along with terracota and jute jewellery.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu traditional items such as Thanjavur bommai and terracotta undiyal are also available.\n\nVisitors can go in for recycled and green products too. Purses and Buddha idols made of banana fibre, bangles and pendants made from coconut shells, doll houses made from bamboo, cutlery made from areca leaves and handicrafts fashioned from discarded silk cocoons are a testament to the skilled craftsmanship of the artisans.\n\nThe artists, who have made the smiling face of former President, late APJ Abdul Kalam, in paper quilling, deserve a special mention.\n\nThe exhibition will be on till January 17.\n\nIt is open on all days from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.",
