    "text": "Motorists using Jawaharlal Nehru Salai have been complaining that many stretches of this road are battered and pose a challenge to motorists.\n\nThe road has not been repaired after the floods in December, say motorists frequenting the road.\n\n\u201cThe road does not have potholes, but just many bad stretches that force drivers to move from one lane to another. Traffic is slow and vehicles only follow each other since one really doesn\u2019t know when to turn right or left. On a stretch, which starts from near the Hyundai showroom and ends at Olympia junction, only one lane is available,\u201d said R. Krishnan, who works at the Guindy Industrial Estate.\n\nThe road that runs from Kathipara junction to Manali in north Chennai is in poor condition and with elevated Metro Rail between Udayam Theatre and Kathipara junction, there is insufficient lighting, making driving at night even more difficult.\n\nC. Balasubramaniam, a trader, said the Highways Department, had not even carried out patchwork after the rains.\n\n\u201cThe police had filled up a large pothole near the Vadapalani junction when the Governor was en route. Earlier, personnel from Department arrived even when there were small showers. But now, nobody bothers. The Corporation, which has begun re-laying interior roads, seems impervious to fixing this road, despite it being an arterial one,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, sources in the Highways Department said that delay in work was due to the shortage in bitumen and also due to small number of contractors available.",
