    "text": "Customers prefer going to restaurants/hotels with family and friends\n\nFood ordering app company Zomato said on Monday that it is closing down services in four cities in the country, including Coimbatore, as the size of market was small in these cities.\n\nThough there are a few websites through which customers can order online from the restaurant of their choice and get the food delivered at the door step, the demand for such a service is not as high as it is in the metros.\n\nIt is true, says V. Lakshmi Narayanan of Bird on Tree. Just six per cent to seven per cent of their business comes from the online platform.\n\nTake aways and online ordering is low in Coimbatore for fine dine restaurants. Customers want to visit these places to relax and spend time with family. Even those who place orders online, prefer to do so directly through the website of the restaurant.\n\nBalachandar, secretary of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association, says even for those hotels that have a huge volume of parcel and home delivery orders, placing orders online is just two per cent to three per cent of the business. When the IT sector was doing well in the city the demand was high for online orders. Now it has declined, he says.\n\nOne reason could be that the city is not as big as the metros and customers prefer to come to restaurants/hotels with family and friends.\n\nHotels and restaurants would be willing to have online options if the business is good. They will need to have personnel only to monitor online orders. If there are going to be just two or three orders a day, it will not serve the purpose, he adds.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nM.
