It also proposed a new cattle slaughtering facility in Ukkadam at Rs. 14.74 crore with the capacity to deal with 300 animals a day.\n\nAnd Rs 56 crore for modernising the existing facilities.\n\nSources said that the corporation had planned to use the funds to modernise and strengthen the effluent treatment plants attached to the existing slaughter houses.\n\nAt the time of submitting the proposal, the corporation expected 50 per cent of the total project cost from the Union Government and 25 per cent from the Tamil Nadu Government.\n\nPPP mode\n\nAfter the Union Government cited shortage of funds and backed out, the civic body tried the public-private partnership mode, the sources said. Now in the absence of funds, the corporation had more or less shelved the project, they added.",
