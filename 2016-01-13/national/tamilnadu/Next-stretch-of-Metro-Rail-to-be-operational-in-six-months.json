Following this, overhead electrical work will be taken up. We are hoping to launch the commercial operations in six months,\u201d an official said.\n\nInitially, the plans were to start operations only between Little Mount and Nanganallur Road station first and subsequently extend it up to the Chennai airport.\n\n\u201cWe realised this will not make too much of a difference; so, we have decided to commence operations till Chennai airport itself,\u201d an official added.\n\nAlso, they plan to extend the services up to St. Thomas Mount too.\n\n\u201cSoon after the works are complete, we will call the Commissioner, Metro Rail Safety, to conduct the safety inspection and once we get the approval, the services will begin,\u201d he added.\n\nThe first service of Chennai Metro Rail between Koyambedu and Alandur, a distance of 10 km, was started only in July last after five years of construction work. Though the authorities wanted to initially operate from Koyambedu to St. Thomas Mount, they could not do so since St. Thomas Mount station was not complete by then. Currently, the passenger traffic between Koyambedu and Alandur ranges between 10,000 and 12,000 every day; Authorities think ridership will improve if the operations are extended.",
