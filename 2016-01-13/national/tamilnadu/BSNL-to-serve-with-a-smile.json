A resolution to this effect was adopted at its district conference held here recently. Expressing satisfaction over the information that BSNL has earned Rs.672 crore operational profit this year, it noted that for first time more mobile customers have come to BSNL from other service providers than those who had migrated from BSNL to other service providers.\n\nThe BSNL had proved that its services are reliable at times of natural calamities after the disastrous Chennai floods.
