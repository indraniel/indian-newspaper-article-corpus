Sixty per cent of micro and small industries had shut shop. Inadequate power supply, industrial policies were among the reasons for the industry suffering.\n\nMr. Anbumani also said that in the past four years investment worth Rs. 65,000 crore that was to be made in the State had gone to other states.
