    "text": "City Police Commissioner A. Amalraj has directed all traffic police personnel to use breath analyzers to check whether drivers are drunk.\n\nDrunken driving is one of the main reasons for road accidents that have ended in lives being lost and the city police have booked many cases against those driving in inebriated condition. In most instances, the traffic police resorted to asking the motorists to blow air out so that they could smell their breath. While this worked it was rather unhygienic for the police.\n\nDeputy Commissioner (Traffic) of the Coimbatore City Police, T. Sivakumar, said that city police have 18 breath analyzers, to check for drunken driving that are with 15 sub inspectors who head the traffic police unit for as many police stations in the city and with three traffic police inspectors. \u201cIf the analyzer shows a person has more than 35 mg alcohol per 100 ml of blood, he is considered intoxicated,\u201d he said.",
