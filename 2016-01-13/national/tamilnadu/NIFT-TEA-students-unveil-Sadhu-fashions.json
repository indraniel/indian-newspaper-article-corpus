The concept was \u2018Sadhu Fashions\u2019 and the undergraduate students of Apparel Fashion Design incorporated the essence of the robes worn by saints of different eras into their designs. They presented both European silhouettes and Indian styles. They also designed accessories to go with the theme. The fashion show was held on Swami Vivekandanda\u2019s birth anniversary on January 12.\n\n\u201cIt took almost five months to design and produce the apparels,\u201d said K. Nandhini, a student. Most of them were made by blending cotton and artificial fibres such as polyester and satin.\n\n\u201cBlended fibres will improve draping capability and offer more flexibility,\u201d pointed out Arundhati Ghoshal, head of the Apparel Fashion Design department at the NIFT-TEA Institute.\n\nThe designers used animal and floral motifs to indicate the natural habitat of the saints of yore who lived in jungles.\n\n\u201cAll these designs, which were shown to a select audience, will be documented and disseminated to the apparel industry to augment the exports and domestic sales into niche markets. The clothes are meant for use on festival and commemoration days,\u201d said G. Boopathy, the lecturer who coordinated the research.",
