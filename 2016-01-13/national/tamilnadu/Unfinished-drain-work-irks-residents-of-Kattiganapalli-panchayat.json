    "text": "Work on a storm water drain dug out hastily for discharge of rainwater from the water logged areas of TNHB \u2013 Phase II by the Kattiganapalli Panchayat here has been left unfinished, much to the ire of the residents.\n\nThe work on the drain for discharge of rain water into an already running canal opposite the road to the district stadium complex was started in the first week of December, after the spate in rains had led to severe water logging in the residential TNHB-Phase II. The 1.5 meter-deep drain was however left unfinished citing various delays.\n\nAccording to Gururajan, a resident and retired bank employee, instead of digging a new drain, the main canal should have been desilted and the outgrowth along the canal should have been cleared. The work was taken up unilaterally by the Panchayat and was left unfinished, he said.\n\nWhen contacted, Aijaz, president of Kattigaanapalli Panchayat, said that the work was taken up after one of the residents had petitioned the Collector on water logging in TNHB-II.\n\nThe work had stopped in lieu of Pongal, he said.\n\nHowever, when asked about the residents\u2019 allegations that the works were stopped for over a fortnight now, Mr. Aijaz said the workers had gone for Sabarimala and hence the work has been temporarily stopped. \u201cWe plan to finish the works by the end of this month,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the residents of TNHB \u2013II, this was a drain work taken without consultation and left midway, posing lot of civic hurdle.",
