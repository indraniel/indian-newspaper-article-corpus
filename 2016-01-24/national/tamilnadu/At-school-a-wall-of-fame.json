Moorthy\n\nAround 20 to 25 artists are beautifying the walls of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Ashok Nagar by painting pictures of achievers from various walks of life.\n\n\u201cApart from painting images of achievers, the artists also painted in details about them, including the prestigious awards conferred on them,\u201d Meenakshi Sundaram, one of the artists, said.\n\nThe work on beautifying the walls was started before the floods in December.\n\nWork on one of the school walls was completed, before it collapsed as a result of the floods. The wall is now being re-constructed. Once it is finished, we will take up the painting work, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are beautifying the walls out of our own interest; we are on a mission to keep the neighbourhood clean. This exercise will help students learn more about these achievers and get inspired by then,\u201d said Jayapriya Devi, another artist.",
