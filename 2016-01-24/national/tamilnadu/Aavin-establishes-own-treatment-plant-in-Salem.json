The plant consists of pre-treatment such as screen chamber, fat remover and chemical doser, said K. Santhi, general manager of the Salem unit.\n\nWater treatment\n\nThe pre-treated waste water is being treated in Anaerobic UASB Reactor as a primary treatment.\n\nThe waste water is further treated in Aerobic process by diffused aeration system.\n\nTo achieve the pollution control board norms of 30 mg / litre BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) tertiary treatment is provided.\n\nThe treated water is crystal clear and being used for farming and gardening.\n\nThe combined treatment process of Anaerobic followed by diffused aeration system saves substantial amount of electrical energy as compared to conventional process.\n\nThe treatment ensures clean environment, trouble-free operation and easy maintenance, the General Manager said.\n\nDuring the anaerobic treatment methane rich biogas is generated. This is being used in the boiler / canteen as fuel thereby saving fossil fuel and generating additional revenue for the union.\n\nMs. Santhi said that in continuation of its commitment towards clean environment, the Union is planning to treat the solid waste generated in anaerobic and aerobic process by installing \u2018state of the art sludge dewatering system.\u2019\n\nThis will eliminate the nuisance of sludge drying beds.\n\nThe union has also planned to convert this solid waste into pellet so as to be used as fuel in boiler for additional revenue, Ms. Santhi said.",
