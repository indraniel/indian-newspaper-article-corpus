A senior official of the department said the scheme would ensure nutritional security through fresh green vegetables. He said demand for vegetable was fuelled by various factors, which include urbanisation, increase in per capita consumption and health consciousness.\n\nIn the urban setting, the desire to take up gardening and nurture plants is often not realised as space is hard to come by. When it comes to cultivation of vegetables, Tamil Nadu stands first, covering 2.76 lakh hectares. The production is 29.95 tonne per hectare at the national level.",
