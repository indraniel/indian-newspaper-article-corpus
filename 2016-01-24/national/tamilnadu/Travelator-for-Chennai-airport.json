Airport director Deepak Shastri said, \u201cThe travelator will connect the terminals with each other, provide connectivity to the terminals from the Metro Rail station on the Chennai airport premises and also to the multi-level car park on the premises. This will help passengers commute easily within the airport.\u201d\n\nEvery day, there are at least 30,000 passengers travelling through the airport. The travelator had originally been a part of the project to modernise the airport at a cost of Rs. 2,000 crore. But the idea was scrapped as part of cost-cutting measures. The authorities had said the travelator may cost Rs. 50 crore; but sources said it was likely to cost more.",
