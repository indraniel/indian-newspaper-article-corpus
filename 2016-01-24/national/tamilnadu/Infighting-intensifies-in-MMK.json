    "text": "The infighting in the Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, which took a turn in October last, seems to have surfaced to split the party again.\n\nM.H. Jawahirullah was removed from Manithaneya Makkal Katchi by its executive committee after a day-long meeting in the city on Saturday.\n\nThe decision was announced by Thameemum Ansari, who claims to have taken over the party\u2019s leadership.\n\n'Instigating violence'\n\n\u201cHe has been removed for instigating violence against the members of the party. The executive committee has accepted the removal of Mr. Jawahirullah from its primary membership,\u201d said Thameemum Ansari.\n\nHe also alleged that Mr. Jawahirullah tried to disrupt the executive committee meeting by sending goons. \u201cDespite all this, the executive meeting went off peacefully. The executive committee has been given full authorisation by the cadre to decide on the alliance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe accused the police of not doing enough to stop the violence.\n\nWhen asked if this expulsion would affect the alliance with the PWF, he said,\u201cThe alliance with the PWF is not the reason why Mr. Jawahirullah has been removed. This problem has been going for the last 5-6 years,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice said that members of the Manitha Neya Makkal Katchi lodged a complaint with the Egmore police stating that their office had been ransacked by a group of people when their meeting was going on.\n\n\u201cThey claim that some people shouted slogans and damaged the property inside. We are investigating,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nAbdul Samath, who claims that he is the party\u2019s general secretary, was also removed by Mr. Ansari. However, in a statement, Mr. Samath claimed that Mr. Ansari had actually been removed from the party\u2019s membership in October last year for disciplinary reasons. \u201cThis was welcomed at the executive committee meeting held in Madurai in November 2015. He is creating confusion by using the party\u2019s names and flags. We will take action against him,\u201d he said.\n\nM.H. Jawahirullah removed from\n\nparty by Thameemum\n\nAnsari",
