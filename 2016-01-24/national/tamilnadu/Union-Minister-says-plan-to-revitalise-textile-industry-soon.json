TEA president A. Sakthivel pointed out the need for introducing duty drawback for those apparels that were made from fabrics imported under the \u2018Advance License Scheme\u2019.\n\n\u201cPresently, duty drawback is not given for such apparels, as fabrics are imported without any duty levied under the said scheme. But our explanation is that fabric cost comes only to around 40 per cent of the apparel cost, with the remaining cost incurred by the use of materials that attract duty. Hence, the request is to give duty draw back for the 60 per cent of the cost during the export of the apparels\u201d, he explained.\n\nMr. Gangwar inaugurated a skill development centre at NIFT-TEA Knitwear Institute and the re-designed web site of Tirupur Exporters Association and visited the Common Effluent Treatment Plant at Arulpuram, during the day.",
