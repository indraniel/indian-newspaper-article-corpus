    "text": "College teachers being forced to correct 80 papers a day in some cases\n\nSenate members of Bharathidasan University on Saturday complained that the pressure on college teachers to evaluate a large number of answer sheets was leading to inaccuracies.\n\nRaising the issue at the Senate meeting here on Saturday, Manjula Devi, Associate Professor of Arignar Anna Government Arts College, Musiri, said that undue pressure was being mounted on college teachers to correct more than 65 papers a day as against 40 papers. There were instances, where the evaluators were forced to correct 80 to 85 answer sheets. It would naturally force them to complete the work in a hurry and affect the fortune of students.\n\nAnother member said that it had had its impact on the paper evaluation recently. Some of the best performing students had scored single digit marks.\n\nThey would not fail in normal circumstances. The discrepancies could not be allowed to continue.\n\nA few other members, who joined the debate, asked the university officials to form a clear policy on answer sheet evaluation.\n\nResponding to their grievances, V.M. Muthukumar, Vice-Chancellor, said the teachers would not be given more than 40 answer sheets a day for evaluation.\n\nThe decision would be informed to all evaluation centres.\n\nThe complaints on under-evaluation would be studied. Discrepancies, if any, would be rectified.\n\nSome members said there was a delay over issuance of mark sheets to the students. Besides clearing the backlog, steps should be taken to issue mark sheets soon after the announcement of results.\n\nMr. Muthukumar said the number of post graduate students had gone up to 957 during 2015-16 from 551 in 2014-15.\n\nC.
