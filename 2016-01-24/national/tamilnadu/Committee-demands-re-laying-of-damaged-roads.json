    "text": "With poor condition of roads continuing to cause hardship to the city residents, Tamil Nadu Consumer and Public Rights Vigilance Committee has demanded that damaged roads be re-laid by the corporation at the earliest.\n\nA quarterly meeting, presided over by its chairman S. Selvam and members, was held here on Friday in which officials from various departments also participated.\n\nMembers pointed out that most of the city roads were dug for laying pipelines, underground cable works and by the electricity board.\n\nSince the roads were not re-laid, residents were the most affected, they added. They wanted the corporation to carry out repair works to the roads and re-lay it.\n\nThey also said that while delivering the LPG cylinders in households, the delivery man demands Rs. 25 to Rs. 50 more than the service charge fixed by the government.\n\nMembers demanded regular supply of provisions through public distribution outlets to the residents. They said that cable TV operators charge Rs. 250 per month as subscription fee instead of Rs. 70 as fixed by the government. They sought bus terminals at the city entrances and anti-dengue operations in all the houses in 60 wards.",
