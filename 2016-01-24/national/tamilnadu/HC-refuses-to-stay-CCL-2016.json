Ltd. and Asianet Communications Pvt. Ltd against the cricket company to recover dues to be paid by CCL.\n\nBoth the media houses approached the High Court seeking an interim relief contending that the company should not be allowed to conduct CCL 2016 or any similar event till their dues are fully paid.\n\nRefusing to grant any interim relief, Justice S. Manikumar directed Karbonn Mobiles India Private Limited, a Delhi-based company which is the garnishee in all the applications, to deposit Rs. 67.10 lakh as fixed deposit to the credit of the media houses one week before the final match of CCL 2016 scheduled for February 13.\n\nThe judge then appointed retired Judge of Madras High Court, Justice K. Mohan Ram, as arbitrator.",
