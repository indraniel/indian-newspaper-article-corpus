Madurai Veeran, an elderly Dalit man. Only around 450 people belong to Dalit community in Kuruvithurai, which has a total population of more than 3,000.\n\n\u201cThe caste Hindus don\u2019t like the fact that we are also coming up in life, taking up jobs and dressing properly,\u201d said A. Sathish Kannan, a youngster who is a tailor.\n\nRefuting the allegations by caste Hindus that a provocative song played by Dalits in loudspeaker during Pongal triggered the incident, Mr. Sathish said that they were playing only movie songs.\n\n\u201cThe song they were pointing out apparently had a line saying that \u201cenough being slaves and it is time to retort\u201d. It was not played intentionally. On the contrary, during their (caste Hindus) functions, they play songs glorifying their caste throughout,\u201d he said. The Dalits alleged discrimination in providing of basic amenities and allocation of government schemes to their areas. Many villagers alleged that issues like harassment while travelling in buses, double-tumbler system where plastic cups were used for Dalits in teashops still persisted in the village.\n\nAs many Dalits alleged that they were not allowed to buy from the PDS shops located in the caste Hindus dominated area on all days, revenue officials now ordered to open a part-time PDS shop in the Dalit area soon.",
