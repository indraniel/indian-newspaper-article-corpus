Some of these plants were nearly 40 years old.\n\nVisitors to the exhibition were provided information on the origins of the trees on display. They also found out what it takes to keep a bonsai at home.\n\n\u201cCultivating bonsai at home can be a time-consuming and expensive hobby, but gives immense joy to people who truly love plants,\u201d said Vikram Thambuswamy, who had about 35 of his plants on display at the exhibition.\n\nWhile bonsai is known as the art of growing any tree in miniature using techniques such as pruning, wiring, defoliation and grafting, there are some who see it as cruelty to plants.\n\n\u201cSaying that bonsai promotes cruelty to plants is a huge misconception. In today\u2019s age, when gardens have become non-existent due to shrinking spaces, we are taking a bit of green into our homes with bonsai plants in addition to developing a hobby,\u201d said K. Sivaji, president of the bonsai association.\n\nThe two-day exhibition concludes on Sunday (10 a.m. to 7 p.m.).\n\nRising interest\n\nWhile the association has 38 members now, Mr. Sivaji said that the interest among people to learn about bonsai cultivation had been steadily increasing.\n\n\u201cMost of us who have been cultivating it for a while now deem it the highest form of meditation,\u201d he said.\n\nInteracting with visitors at the exhibition, G. Raja, the association secretary, said that it was important to pick trees which are best suited for tropical climate, which the city has.\n\n\u201cMost who have been cultivating it for a while deem it the highest form of meditation\u201d",
