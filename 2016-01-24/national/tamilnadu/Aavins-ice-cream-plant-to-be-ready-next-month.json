This step will bring more brand visibility to the milk in districts other than Chennai.\n\nThe ice cream and paneer plants are being expanded at a cost of Rs. 23.50 crore and the work is nearly complete, said sources in Aavin, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation.\n\n\u201cWe will be opening 1,100 parlours in the districts coming year. Deep freezers and bottle coolers are being procured at a cost of Rs. 5 crore,\u201d the source explained. With the new plant, Aavin will be able to increase the number of flavours. \u201cThe plant has been so designed that school children can visit it and watch how icecream is made,\u201d the source said.",
