A.R. Rahman\u2019s \u2018Nenje Ezhu\u2019 is in town and people have travelled from Bombay, Palakkad etc to catch the concert of their beloved maestro.\n\nFrom the cute kindergarten student, Afreen, who ran to Blaaze to take a selfie, to \u2018Rahmaniacs\u2019, a group of youngsters who arrived from Palakkad who live and breathe Rahman\u2019s music, to hordes of girls on the terrace of adjacent buildings screaming and screeching and even actors Dhanush and Trisha, who are seated in the crowd, the audience is filled with people across age groups, languages and different walks of life to groove to the concert which has an astounding line up of exceptional singers right from music veteran SPB to young blood such as Sid Sriram.\n\nThe stage is set, the lights are aglow and the audience are seated, but only until Rahman comes on stage.\n\nAs Azhagiya Tamil Magan\u2019s title song announces the Music Maestro\u2019s entry and he starts singing \u2018Rathi thee thee\u2019 from the movie \u2018Sivaji\u2019 and follows it up by the evergreen friendship anthem \u2018Mustafa Mustafa\u2019, he instantly captivates all the hearts of Coimbatore and they rise from the seats and groove to the music.\n\nThe frenzy continued for nearly three hours.",
