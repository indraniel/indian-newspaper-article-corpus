More than 50 per cent of the 42 commercial banks having a total of 307 branches in the district submit the data mostly after a month, sources added.\n\nDisbursements\n\n\u201cDue to this, financial planning for the subsequent quarter of the fiscal becomes difficult. Unless the achievements on credit disbursements vis-a-vis the proportional targets for the respective quarter was compiled quickly, steps could not be taken to speed up the credit disbursements in priority sectors like agriculture, MSME, housing and education, among others, so as to ensure achievement of targets set for the financial year,\u201d said banking experts.\n\nThe banking sources pointed out though the lead bank scheme, introduced in 1969, envisages the need to coordinate the efforts of all credit institutions in the allotted districts to increase the flow of credit to priority sectors, there is no yard stick given on the stipulated period for submission.\n\n\u201cIt is a drawback that the lead bank has only coordinating powers not any capacity to enforce various banks to submit the data for the period ended quickly,\u201d the banking sources added.",
