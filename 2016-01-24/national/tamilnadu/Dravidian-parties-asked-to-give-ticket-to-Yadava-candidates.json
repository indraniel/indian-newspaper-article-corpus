The resolution said that for the last 48 years dravidian parties never gave a ticket to a Yadava candidate either in assembly or in lok sabha elections in the constituencies that are part of the present Tiruvannamalai district. The resolution added that every caste should get its due representation.\n\nAs Yadavas did not get it, the neglect is fit to be condemned, it added.\n\nTherefore they wanted a ticket each in Tiruvannamalai district in the coming assembly election.\n\nDistrict Secretary K.Rajaram, president M.Rajangam and Treasurer R.Sivakumar were among the participants.",
