    "text": "A customer of a nationalised bank who had a challenging time to prove that he had not withdrawn Rs. 9,800 from his savings account in 2011, has finally won his case in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Dharmapuri.\n\nThe forum has directed the bank to pay a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to the customer for the mental agony suffered by him.\n\nPetitioner S.T. Padmanabhan had withdrawn a sum of Rs. 3,500 from an ATM in Harur on October 22, 2011 but did not receive a receipt. Though a receipt from another ATM showed a balance of Rs. 9,895 in his account, the balance did not add up when he tried to withdraw another Rs. 1,000 from a third machine, as the balance showed only Rs. 95. Since his complaints accompanied by ATM receipts to the officials concerned did not help in recovering Rs. 9,800, he filed a plea seeking compensation.\n\nThe bank officials rejected the claim of the customer and said he had deliberately suppressed the fact that he had withdrawn a sum of Rs. 9,800.\n\nAfter examining the documents presented by both sides, the forum, comprising I. Pandurangan, K. Kasturi, R. Bhaskar Kumaravel said, \u201cWhile it is the duty of the bank to take action on a complaint, it has not provided its service. It is a deficiency in service as the bank has not taken efforts to act on the complaint and deposit the sum in his account.\u201d\n\nThough the claim of the customer was rejected by the bank, it did not present documents to support its claim, the forum said and directed the bank to deposit a sum of Rs. 9,800 in the customer\u2019s account within a month.\n\nThe forum directed the bank to pay a compensation of Rs. 10,000 and a sum of Rs. 2,000 as litigation costs.",
