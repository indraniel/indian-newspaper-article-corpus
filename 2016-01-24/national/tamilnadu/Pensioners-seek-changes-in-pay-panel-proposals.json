    "text": "Members of the All India Postal Employees Union and government pensioners have demanded changes in the recommendations for the seventh Pay Commission, including revision of minimum wages and the rate of annual increment.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nPostal employees, who recently staged a demonstration in the city, demanded that the minimum wages be fixed at Rs.26,000. J. Ramamurthy, State secretary of All India Postal Employees Union, Group C, said: \u201cThe overall hike percentage also need to be revised. We had to wait for over a decade for the next Pay Commission.\n\n\u201cWe also want the recommendations to incorporate the demand for two increments during promotions and revision of salary every five years. Pension must be revised to 60 per cent of the last drawn salary of the pensioner.\u201d\n\nIndefinite strike planned\n\nThe union plans to go on an indefinite strike, along with other Central government employees\u2019 associations, in the first week of March if the suggestions it made are not incorporated in the seventh Pay Commission recommendations.\n\nPensioners too feel that the pension must be increased to meet the growing expenditure. S.M. Chellaswamy, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Elders Welfare Association, said: \u201cAt present, there is a suggestion that the pension amount be increased by 20 per cent when the retired person turns 80. But, we want the age limit to be revised to 75 years to enable pensioners meet their medical expenditures.\u201d",
