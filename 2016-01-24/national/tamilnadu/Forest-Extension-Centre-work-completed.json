Spread over a plinth area of 1,600 square feet, it has been built at an expenditure of Rs. 31.95 lakh under the Tamil Nadu Bio-diversity Conservation and Greening Project.\n\nIt will be used for imparting training on raising and nursing saplings for stepping up forest cover across the district. Periodical training sessions would be organised to benefit students, teachers, environmentalists, and Forest Department in-service personnel, said Sivakumar, Assistant Conservation of Forests, here on Saturday.\n\nThe centre would be utilised to sensitise farmers, students, and members of the public to the importance of afforestation, he added. Saplings in bulk would be available at the centre. Those interested could contact by calling 97895-19567, he added.",
