Saravanan (28) of Gayathri Nagar in Mudaliarpet. Police sources said that frustration over unemployment could have been the reason for him to have taken the extreme step.\n\nSaravanan had asked for a sum of Rs.15 lakh from his father to begin his own business as he was unemployed.\n\nHis father Vinobha, a farmer, owned some agricultural properties.\n\nBut his father had asked for some time to get the money as he had to sell some of his agricultural property to obtain a good amount.\n\nHowever Saravanan picked up a quarrel with his father on Thursday.\n\nUnconvinced by his father\u2019s promises, he broke down in frustration.\n\nSaravanan's family members found him hanging at his room the next day morning. \u2013 Special Correspondent",
