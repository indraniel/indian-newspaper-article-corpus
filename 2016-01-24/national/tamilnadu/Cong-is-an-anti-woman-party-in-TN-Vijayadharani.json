Vijayadharani, who was removed from the post of Tamil Nadu Mahila Congress president on Friday, said the party, which has a woman as national president, had turned into an \u201canti-woman party\u201d in the State.\n\nIn a frontal attack on TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan, she told The Hindu that the Congress organisation had been destroyed under his leadership. \u201cHe has alienated every other leader in the TNCC to the extent that people are losing hope. Mr. Elangovan feels woman should not be in politics and that is why you see him making such outrageous remarks against women leaders, including Chief Minister Jayalalithaa,\u201d Ms. Vijayadharani alleged.\n\nMr. Elangovan was running the party merely by issuing statements to the media.\n\nMs. Vijayadharani said the party high command too had acted in an \u201carbitrary manner\u201d by removing her from the post.\n\n\u201cI was not given any notice. If my supporters going to the police against Mr. Elangovan was the problem, you should remember that his supporters too filed a complaint against me under the SC/ST Act. Why has he been retained,\u201d she questioned.\n\nMs. Vijayadharani said she has sought an appointment with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.\n\n\u201c I will decide about my future in the party after the meeting. I feel removing me from the post was completely unjustified,\u201d she added.\n\nOn Friday night, the Congress high command appointed M. Jansirani, grand daughter of former MLA Ponnammal, as Tamil Nadu Mahila Congress president.",
