Stalin here on Saturday.\n\nMr. Stalin paid floral tributes to the portrait of former DMK MP M. Sankaralingam at his residence in Therekalpudur near Nagercoil. Later, Mr. Stalin told reporters that the DMK would never comment on pre-poll surveys.\n\nThe people of the State expected a big change in the coming Assembly elections, he noted.\n\nWhen asked about the claim of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam that it had brought the State from darkness to light, Mr. Stalin said that only the people around Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her partymen amassed wealth. Mr. Stalin said that the DMK would spell its stand on alliance only after the announcement of election date.\n\nHe said action should be initiated against those responsible for the suicide of a Dalit student in the University of Hyderabad. Recurrence of Dalit student suicides and attacks on Dalits were a cause for concern, he added.",
