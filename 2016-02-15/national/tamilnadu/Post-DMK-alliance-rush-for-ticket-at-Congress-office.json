Sources said those who turned up were primarily from southern districts.\n\nThe alliance with the DMK has clearly had an impact on Congress workers since the crowd began building up only on Saturday when the electoral pact was formalised.\n\nProspects bright\n\nSridhar, a party member from Thoothukudi, said the electoral prospects of the Congress were now bright. \u201cIn the southern districts, it is very hard to beat the DMK-Congress combination. We are very happy with the development,\u201d he added, after filing his papers.\n\nThe rush for constituencies in southern districts seemed strategic as many felt it was in this belt that the DMK would allot most seats to the Congress.\n\nAn aspirant from Kanyakumari said the Congress lost the Lok Sabha election in the constituency because the party went alone and the minority votes were split due to a multi-cornered contest.\n\nMeanwhile, TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan said if required he would personally meet DMDK leader Vijayakant to convince him to join the DMK front.\n\nAspirants who wanted to boycott application\n\nprocess also\n\nin queue",
