While there were not many celebrations to observe the day, the crowd was a little high at tourist spots such as VOC Park, Kovai Coutrallam, Aliyar and in near by Mettuppalayam.\n\nSuccessful inter-caste married couples cut a cake and celebrated the day organised by the \u2018Kalappu Thirumanam Purinthor Nala Sangam\u2019 affiliated to Thanthai Periyar Dravida Kazhagam at Periyar Padipagam near Gandhipuram Bus Stand on Sunday.\n\nTwo inter-caste marriages were also performed on Sunday.
