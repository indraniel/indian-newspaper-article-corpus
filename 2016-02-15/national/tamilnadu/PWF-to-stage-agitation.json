    "text": "People Welfare Front (PWF) , constituted of CPI (M), CPI, MDMK and VCK parties, has resolved to hold a massive agitation against Corporation administration on February 15 stating that the corruption had prevented the benefits of many schemes from reaching people.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 per cent of the Rs. 500 crore spent on development projects during the last four years have gone as commissions. We are not making allegations out of nowhere. It is the AIADMK councillors themselves have raised the issue on many occasions and one AIADMK councillor even attempted self-immolation citing apathy to his ward when it came to implementation of works\u201d, CPI district secretary M. Subramanian, told reporters.\n\nCondition of roads is not too commensurate with the status of a knitwear cluster that generates almost Rs 20,000 crore in foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cBad state of roads is big hindrance. Also steps are not being taken by the authorities to ease traffic congestions\u201d, pointed out CPI (M) district secretary K. Subramanian.\n\nPublic\n\nmeetings\n\nMr. Sivabalan, MDMK town secretary, said the PWF would organise two public meetings at Palladam and Tirupur on February 20.\n\nProminent leaders like Thirumavalavan of VCK, Vaiko of MDMK, G. Ramakrishnan of CPI (M) and K. Subbarayan of CPI, would be attending the events.",
