Hemanathan, Regional Assistant Director of Art and Culture. He said that the dramas such as \u201cHarichandra\u201d, \u201cValli Tirumanam\u201d, \u201cSathiyavan Savithri\u201d, \u201cBama Vijayam\u201d along with \u201cPavalakodi\u201d have always remained favourites of all sections of art lovers of the State. Many theatre artistes who acted in these dramas, later won name and fame in cinema. For various reasons, the plays of Sankaradas Swamigal have almost been forgotten by the present generation. The younger generation is not aware of Swamigal\u2019s personality and his great works.",
