Mathavan, around 100 residents of Velachery region have carried out a survey of 46 rapidly-developing layouts in and around Pallikaranai with the aim of understanding factors that could aggravate flooding during heavy rains.\n\nThey have completed the mapping of roads in this region that require new stormwater drains. \u201cDuring the mapping, we found that only 5 percent of the newly developing layouts had stormwater drains,\u201d said Mr. Mathavan, who was part of the team that developed the disaster resilience index for Chennai in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe State government has already made proposals for implementation of stormwater drains in developing areas along Rajiv Gandhi Salai. But this requires funding to the tune of Rs. 4,000 crore and is expected to be implemented only after a few years. So, our focus is on simple solutions in each neighbourhood to cope with disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nWith support from government agencies, these groups of residents plan to create awareness about disaster preparedness.\n\nResidents in each of the streets learn about the strength and weakness of existing civic conditions on a weekly basis.\n\nThe group has surveyed 46 rapidly developing layouts in and around Pallikaranai",
