    "text": "The corporation has said in a release issued here on Saturday that it did take up work in a park at Ashok Nagar in Maniakarampalayam and has not paid any contractor for not doing work. The release comes in response to allegation by former councillor, M. Krishnasamy, who in a press meet told reporters that the corporation without carrying out work in the reserved site at Ashok Nagar had paid Rs. 4.55 lakh to the contractor.\n\nThe corporation was supposed to have laid foot path in the park in the area but it did not even develop the park for the foot path to be constructed, he added.\n\nIn its rebuttal, the civic body had said the zone committee had on December 19, 2014 resolved to develop a park in the reserved site and approved of Rs. 5 lakh expenditure. Subsequently, the Corporation Council had accorded its approval on January 27, 2015. After making the necessary deductions, the corporation paid only Rs. 4.55 lakh to the contractor, the civic body said and also attached pictures of the park it had constructed.",
