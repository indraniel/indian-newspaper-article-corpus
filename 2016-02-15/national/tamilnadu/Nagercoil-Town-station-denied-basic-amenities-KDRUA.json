    "text": "It is pathetic that even small railway stations generating very low income are provided with better basic amenities in Kerala, which are falling under the Thiruvananthapuram Division of Southern Railway, but many stations in Tamil Nadu falling under the division are neglected, laments P. Edward Jeni, Secretary, Kanyakumari District Rail Users Association (KDRUA) here on Saturday.\n\nThe association appealed to the railway authorities to provide minimum shelter and basic amenities at Nagercoil Town station in Kanyakumari district.\n\nOn Mondays and Tuesdays, an average of 200 people are boarding Tirunelveli- Hapa Express at Nagercoil town station. They are forced to take the train by staying in the scorching sun. The train is being operated from 2010 via Nagercoil Town, and even after repeated appeals, it has only fallen on the deaf ears of the authorities, he said. If railways is unable to provide basic amenities, the train should be operated via Nagercoil Junction, he said.",
