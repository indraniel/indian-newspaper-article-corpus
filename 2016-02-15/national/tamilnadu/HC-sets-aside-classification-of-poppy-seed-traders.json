    "text": "The Madras High Court has set aside an order issued under the import policy that classified poppy seed traders into two categories based on their import experience.\n\nJustice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a petition moved by Sri Adinath Traders, a Chennai-based registered dealer of poppy seeds, that challenged the September 14, 2015 order of the Central Bureau of Narcotics.\n\nClassification\n\nThe petitioner submitted that the authorities classified importers of poppy seeds into categories A and B based on their import experience for three financial years during the last five years. While Category A traders were allowed to import 270 tonnes from Turkey, Category B were allowed to import only 180 tonnes. \u201cIn addition, importers under Category B will have to wait for their chance, subject to the availability of the seeds after exhausting the requirement of Category A traders,\u201d the petitioner said. He contended that this affected the level-playing field among traders.\n\nJustice Mr. Sundresh said, \u201cPoppy seeds are used by the general public throughout the country. Therefore, it is immaterial from whom they buy. There is no public interest involved in restricting the sale only by certain traders\u2026 such a classification is illusory, artificial and evasive.\u201d\n\nThe judge then made it clear that the authorities are at liberty to issue a fresh notice as per law.\n\nJustice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a petition moved by\n\na Chennai-based dealer",
