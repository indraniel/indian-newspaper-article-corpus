    "text": ": Subtly hinting that the DMDK could maintain equidistance with the two major Dravidian parties in the coming Assembly election, its leader Premalatha on Sunday did not spare the AIADMK and DMK from criticism. At an informal interaction with journalists here, DMDK founder Vijayakant\u2019s wife appeared dismissive of the DMK-Congress alliance forged a day ago. She avoided a direct reply when asked to comment about the electoral tie-up. \u201cWhat do I have to comment about it? You (journalists) are well aware of the public\u2019s reaction on social media about the revived ties between the DMK and Congress. The public themselves have indicated in their comments on social media that these two parties were the root cause for corruption and other issues,\u201d she said. However, Ms Premalatha added that Mr Vijayakant alone knows which alliance to join. \u201cHe may announce it at the \u2018Turning Point\u2019 conference to be held on February 20 or maybe 10 or 15 days later,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier, she hit out at the ruling AIADMK while soft-pedalling on the BJP. According to her, the State Government was creating a hype that it was doling out cash aid to those affected by last year\u2019s floods but the money was actually sanctioned by the Central Government.",
