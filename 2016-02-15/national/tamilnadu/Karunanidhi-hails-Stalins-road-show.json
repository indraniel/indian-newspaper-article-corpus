Karunanidhi on Sunday said if the failures and shortcomings of the AIADMK government has enthused his party to prepare itself for the Assembly polls, the Namakku Naame road show conducted by his son and party treasurer M.K. Stalin had won the goodwill of all sections of society. In a statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said he had coined the title \u201cNamakku Naame \u201d when Mr. Stalin approached him with a request after deciding to undertake the tour across 234 constituencies. \u201cMr. Stalin\u2019s tour programme has created jitters in the ruling party camp. It is not an exaggeration to say that his tour has galvanised the party organisation and cadres alike,\u201d he said.",
