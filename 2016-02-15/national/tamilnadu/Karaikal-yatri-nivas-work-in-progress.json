    "text": "Construction of a motel at Tirunallar to accommodate the devotees and pilgrims visiting the Sri Dharbaranyeswarar temple has been in progress.\n\nThe need for constructing the motel arose following large congregation of pilgrims at this town on Saturdays. The town turns busy during the week-end due to sudden influx of devotees from different parts of the state in general and the country in particular, an official said here on Saturday. Although the Tourism Department had constructed \u201cyatri nivas\u201d, it is inadequate to meet the huge demand for accommodation.\n\nThe Union Territory government, under its Tirunallar Temple City Development Project, had acquired six acres of land for the construction of the motel. The site will have all modern facilities particularly parking area for vehicles including buses and vans. It is being executed in three phases, at the rate of one block in each phase. The first phase will have 50 rooms, 25 each on the ground-floor and first floor. Similar identical structure would come up during the second and third phases. The total area of the first block would be 4,524 square metres with 12 single bedrooms and 13 double bed-rooms. A restaurant will also come up as part of the project.\n\nThe motel will cater to the needs of the poor and will prevent exploitation for accommodation by private lodge owners.",
