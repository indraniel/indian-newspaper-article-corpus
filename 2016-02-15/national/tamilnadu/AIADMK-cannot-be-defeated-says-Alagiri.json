    "text": "Alleging that DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin and his family members were interfering with the internal affairs of the party, former Union Minister M.K. Alagiri said the DMK would not win the 2016 Assembly polls.\n\nIn an interview to a Tamil channel, he said the AIADMK could not be defeated as it had proved its strength by winning in 37 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu two years ago. Mr. Alagiri, who has been expelled from the DMK, alleged that party president M. Karunanidhi had been totally sidelined in the organisation. \u201cSo long as Mr. Stalin is projected (as leader), the party cannot win the election. His family members are interfering with the functioning of the party,\u201d he claimed.\n\nMr. Alagiri also came down on the DMK-Congress alliance saying both the parties lacked in principles. \u201cThe DMK was part of the Congress-led UPA government and left it subsequently. The Congress described the DMK as an ungrateful ally. But the party once again begged the support of the Congress to send Ms. Kanimozhi to the Rajya Sabha,\u201d he charged.",
