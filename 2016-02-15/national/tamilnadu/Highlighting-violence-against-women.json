Hundreds of children and college students in Kannagi Nagar formed a human chain and danced as part of the \u2018One Billion Rising\u2019 campaign here on Sunday.\n\nK.R. Renuka of Centre for Women\u2019s Development and Research said they focussed on Kannagi Nagar this time as hundreds of evicted families lived here and several women and children faced some form of violence on a daily basis. \u201cDuring the campaign, we noticed that men were curious to know about what was happening and why we were doing it. That, at least, is a start for some people. We realised this area had many who faced violence in some form or other, especially children,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce during a workshop for 30 children, Ms. Renuka said she was shocked to find that about 18 of them had been sexually assaulted at homes. \u201cWe think home is a secure place, but even there children are not spared,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter years of dealing with these issues, they decided a year and half ago on raising awareness among men about this issue. \u201cWomen in several households began to find a difference in them after the workshop. Perhaps, that\u2019s the need of the hour now,\u201d she added.\n\nUsing technology to fight child abuse\n\nIn a move to combat child abuse across the State, activists have designed a new android application that will provide users a platform to report on such cases they come across. The application, named Child Rights Monitor (CRM), will have around ten different icons, each giving a brief explanation about the different Acts to protect child rights, such as Juvenile Justice Act, Child Labour(Prohibition and Regulation) Act, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, Right To Education and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. It will also have a provision to directly connect to the 1098 Childline service, child welfare committee, Labour Department and also the District Child Protection Officer. \u201cAll they need to do is click on the icon and they will get the contact details of all of them,\u201d says Cyril Alexander of Mary Anne Charity Trust, an NGO that designed the software.\n\nThe application will be launched on Tuesday, after which the software will be available for free download at Playstore. The initiative is supported by the UNICEF. \u201cThe issue these days is lack of knowledge. When a person witnesses any crime against children, he does not know where to go even if he wants to complain. This application will provide all the knowledge and resources,\u201d says Job Zachariah, Chief of UNICEF, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.\n\n\u201cWe have also been working on launching the second version of CRM, which should be out by this year-end,\u201d says Mr. Cyril.\n\n(Reporting by Sunitha Sekar and Aditi R.)",
