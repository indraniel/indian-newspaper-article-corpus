    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Sunday called upon the partymen not to attach any importance to the views expressed by former Union Minister M.K.Alagiri on the DMK-Congress alliance, saying he had already been expelled from the party and his words should be ignored. Reacting to Mr.Alagiri\u2019s interview to a private satellite channel, Mr Karunanidhi said it was highly condemnable that he had chosen to use his name for his act of betrayal.\n\n\u201cNo one will accept his remarks that both the DMK and the Congress had no principle and the AIADMK could not be defeated,\u201d he said. Mr. Karunanidhi said Mr. Alagiri was deliberately making remarks to disturb the upbeat mood in the party.",
