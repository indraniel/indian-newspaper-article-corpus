    "text": "The beginning of civil works for the third broad gauge line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu has revived hopes among commuters who want Southern Railway to expedite their terminal project here.\n\nConstruction of pit-lines started last year, but it has now slowed down, commuters have pointed out. With operations out of Central and Egmore stations nearly saturated, additional trains to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu could be operated only from Tambaram, they said.\n\nIt will also decongest the two stations, while making it possible to operate new trains to the rest of the country from there, said V. Rama Rao of Traffic and Transportation Forum.\n\nDespite operating more electrical multiple unit services, they just do not seem to be enough to cater to the increasing number of commuters between Chennai Beach and Chengalpattu. Chromepet Rail Users Forum president V. Santhanam said: \u201cWe are very glad the foundation stone has been laid.\n\nThough Railways\u2019 time frame for completion of the project is 36 months, there might be certain delays and this should be minimum,\u201d he said.\n\nEvery day, more than 250 trains are operated on this route, with most of them \u2014 170 services \u2014 between Beach and Tambaram.\n\nThe 30-kilometre Tambaram-Chengalpattu third line will cost about Rs. 256 crore and help in operating EMUs and express trains without detentions anywhere on the way.\n\nThe work includes construction and extension of three major and 70 minor bridges.",
