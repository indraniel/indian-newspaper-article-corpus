Nehruprakash, vice-president, Thoothukudi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (THUDITSSIA) and joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association (TANSTIA).\n\nOf the total investments of Rs.2.42 lakh crore as per MoUs signed by the investors during the GIM, Thoothukudi attracted a sizable portion of investments of around Rs.67,000 crore. It was even more disappointing that despite several MoUs signed by investors during the four day- THUDITSSIA Industrial Exhibition \u2013(TIE) in August last year. It attracted a Rs. 263 crore investment by the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, but nothing took off till now.\n\nOnly when adequate amount of lands and required infrastructure were given to investors, they would come forward to begin their operations, he told The Hindu here on Sunday. Now, automobile industry had become the most sought after one in Thoothukudi and people here expected it after the GIM. He said the industry body in the southern region of Tamil Nadu had been neglected as even most of the flood hit industrial units especially in Thoothukudi had not been given compensation, as of yet. Moreover, a 100-MLD desalination plant, which the State government announced to set up in Thoothukudi, was also a non-starter. Citing these factors, he sought the government to bring such industrial investments as per MoUs.\n\nP.S.S.K. Raja Sankaralingam, president, All India Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Thoothukudi, said the whole face of Thoothukudi\u2019s economy would witness a growth if such promised investments begin to take off. Nowadays, several engineering graduates had been turning up in the Sipcot area here seeking jobs. With the possible investments, Thoothukudi would certainly emerge as a hub of future employment, he said.\n\nHowever, S.K.S.C.N. Dharmaraja, former chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry, Thoothukudi, said he was hoping that projects envisaged in Madurai-Thoothukudi industrial corridor, Vision 2023 document and GIM would start.\n\nT. Mayathevar, General Manager, District Industries Centre, told The Hindu that industrialization under micro and small sector began its venture. Around fifty units began their industrial operations and eligible subsidy had also been provided to such operators, but medium and large scale units were yet to begin their account. As per MoUs signed, industries were categorized into three phases to start up their ventures in a period of six months, one year and two years, the GM said.",
