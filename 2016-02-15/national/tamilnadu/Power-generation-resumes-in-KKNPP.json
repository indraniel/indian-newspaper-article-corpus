    "text": "Power generation in the first 1000-MW reactor of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) resumed on Sunday evening after it suffered a breakdown earlier this month.\n\nAfter attending to the problem, the generation resumed at 6.35 p.m. and subsequently it got synchronised. After resuming, the plant initially generated 160 MW, KKNPP sources told The Hindu .\n\nThe generation came to a halt at 10.35 p.m. on February 4 following a minor steam leak in the secondary line of the turbine. After a long gap, the first reactor commenced operation on January 30, generating 300 MW which later went up to 730 MW. The generation was suspended for a planned shutdown on January 31, the sources added.",
