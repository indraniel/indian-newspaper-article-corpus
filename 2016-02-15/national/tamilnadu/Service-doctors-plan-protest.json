The Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association held its State executive committee meeting on Sunday at the Madras Medical College listing out their demands.\n\n\u201cOur demands include implementing the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations besides providing the child care leave,\u201d said P. Saminathan, association general secretary. \u201cIt had been stipulated in the last Pay Commission that women doctors who are in government service would be permitted to avail themselves of two years\u2019 leave for child care. This entitles them to the leave anytime till the child attains 18 years of age. A woman doctor could take leave if her child falls sick or is taking exams,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe doctors want the government to continue the old pension scheme instead of the new contributory pension scheme. They also want the government to create a corpus fund for their benefit. \u201cThe government could collect a certain amount from us every month which could benefit the family of a doctor in government service in case of his or her demise.\n\nMeeting\n\nThe association will hold a district-wise meeting on Monday and will start wearing their \u2018demand badge\u2019 from Tuesday.
