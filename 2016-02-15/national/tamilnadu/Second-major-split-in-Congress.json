    "text": "The veteran leader from Puducherry, Kannan, had a large following in the 1990s and projected himself as a possible chief ministerial candidate at the peak of his political career. He had been a Speaker of the Union Territory\u2019s Assembly and a Minister.\n\nMr. Kannan's dramatic move to the AIADMK coincides with a phase when the Dravidian party is trying to make inroads into the traditional Congress bastion of Puducherry. Though the Congress had, since 2014, anticipated a move by Mr. Kannan, the choice of the AIADMK to continue his political career has come as a major surprise. The development was being viewed as the second major split in the party after Chief Minister N. Rangasamy stormed out and formed the AINRC in 2011.\n\nWhile Congress leaders put up a brave face downplaying the impact of Mr. Kannan\u2019s exit, the timing should worry the leadership, given the impending the proximity to Assembly polls.\n\n\u201cMr. Kannan leaving the party would not have any impact on the Congress,\u201d said Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee president A. Namassivayam.\n\nThis is not the first time Mr. Kannan had quit the Congress. In 1996, he left the party to join the TMC in Puducherry which he headed.\n\nIn 2001, he moved out to form the Puducherry Makkal Congress and in 2005 the Puducherry Munnetra Congress, but achieved very little. His return to the Congress was rewarded with a Rajya Sabha seat.\n\nA senior leader, on condition of anonymity, said the high command had issued a show cause notice to Mr. Kannan for working against the party candidate during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.",
