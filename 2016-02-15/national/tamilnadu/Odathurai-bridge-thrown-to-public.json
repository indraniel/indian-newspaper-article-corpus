    "text": "The new road over bridge across the railway level crossing at Odathurai along the banks of the Cauvery in the city was finally thrown open to traffic on Sunday, with Chief Minister Jayalalithaa declaring it open through video conference.\n\nThe bridge, which connects the Chinthamani area of the city with the Chennai By-pass Road, has been built at a total cost of Rs.44.52 crore including the Railway portion. It has taken about five years for the project to be completed.\n\nThe project took off in March 2010 but faced several glitches right from the start and overshot its scheduled completion date in March 2012 due a range of problems, including delays caused by land acquisition.\n\nThe Highways Department had to suspend construction work on the bridge on the city side for over a year due to a ownership dispute between an individual and the HR and CE Department over a piece of land. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had vacated an interim stay some months back, paving the way for the resumption of the work.\n\nEarlier, construction of the railway portion of the bridge was also delayed as the Railway authorities terminated an initial contract allegedly because of the poor progress made in the work by the contractor and went for a fresh tender.\n\nThe opening of the bridge would come as a huge relief for motorists in the city as it would provide quick and easy accessibility to the four-lane Tiruchi-Chennai highway from the city.\n\nIt was also expected to ease congestion on the Thiruvanaikovil Highway and also on the Thanjavur Road to an extent.\n\nNow that the bridge has been opened, the Highways Department is expected to take up construction on the Periyar Nagar bridge as traffic could be diverted through the new bridge.",
