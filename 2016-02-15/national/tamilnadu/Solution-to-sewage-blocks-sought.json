Ganesan\n\nIn certain parts of Vyasarpadi, sewage overflow is a recurrent issue.\n\nAreas such as Saamandhipoo Colony, Mallipoo Colony, Kalyanapuram and Pallam Street in Vysarpadi, have been experiencing trouble with choked sewer lines for many years now.\n\nThough the stagnant sewage is cleared temporarily, the problem recurs, complain residents. For the past few days, they have been facing the problem of overflowing sewage.\n\nResidents said that the problem cropped up in many roads in these localities at least once a month and it continued for a few days.\n\n\u201cWe are forced to walk on the roads stagnant with sewage. It is removed on a regular basis through jet-rodding or sucker machines. But, the problem resurfaces the following day,\u201d said P. Ramesh, a resident of Vyasarpadi.\n\nIt may be recalled that residents even resorted to novel protests such as erecting banners that called attention to the issue, a few years ago. But, the issue remains unresolved.\n\nThey demand that the old pipelines be replaced to handle the increase in the sewage load.\n\nSources in Chennai Metrowater said several measures had been initiated to improve sewage pumping stations and replace old pipelines and those damaged in the recent floods. The issue in Vyasarpadi would be looked into and steps taken to provide new sewer lines, they said.\n\nResidents demand that old pipelines be replaced to manage increase in the sewage load",
