    "text": "The parties join hands after a gap of five years\n\nThe Congress-DMK alliance forged in Tamil Nadu for the forthcoming Assembly polls will be replicated in the Union Territory of Puducherry, where the two parties will be joining hands after a gap of five years.\n\nThe alliance deal firmed up by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad with DMK president M. Karunanidhi in Chennai on Saturday was received with much jubilation by the local unit of the DMK in the UT.\n\nA former MLA and senior DMK leader in Puducherry told The Hindu , \u201cThe DMK was not interested in having any truck with the ruling AINRC as there is a strong anti-incumbency mood against it . The party high command is aware of our stand and the prevalent political climate in Puducherry. We are very happy that we are in an alliance with the Congress.\u201d\n\nA senior Congress leader on anonymity confirmed that the alliance between the two parties in Puducherry was more or less a certainty even before Mr. Azad left here for talks with Mr. Karunanidhi on Saturday morning.\n\nFelicitation function\n\nMr. Azad and party general secretary Mukul Wasnik were in Puducherry to lead the felicitation function for veteran Congressman E. Valsaraj who completed 25 years as legislator.\n\nCongress sources confirmed that the leaders had agreed on allying with the DMK in Puducherry after ascertaining the views of party men.\n\n\"There was a dilemma over whether to go it alone or revive the alliance with the DMK. The pros and cons were discussed and most of the party workers preferred an alliance with the DMK,\" a Congress leader said.\n\nThe pattern of alliance finalised between the two parties would now automatically be applicable in Puducherry also.",
