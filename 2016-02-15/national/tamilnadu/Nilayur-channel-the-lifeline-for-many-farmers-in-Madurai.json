Ashok\n\nWhile the composite Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts depend so much on Vaigai river for irrigation and drinking water needs when water is released from Vaigai dam, the channels that take water to big tanks and \u2018kanmois\u2019 also play a vital part in taking water to the hinterland. Nilayur channel which feeds a large number of tanks, including Thuvariman, Madakulam and Thenkal \u2018kanmois,\u2019 is the lifeline for a large number of farmers in western and southern parts of Madurai district.\n\nFrom a bed dam at Mullipallam near Sholavandan, the Nilayur Channel branches off from the Vaigai and snakes through Melakkal, Kodimangalam, Nagamalai Pudukottai, Pudukulam-Sampakudi, Vadivelkarai and Vilachery. From a regulator there, one arm empties into Nilayur tank and another into Perungudi tank. The latter goes on as an extension channel to fill 21 tanks in Virudhunagar district and 23 in Sivaganga districts. It irrigates 6,491 acres \u2014 4,660 through \u2018kanmois\u2019 and 1,831 directly.",
