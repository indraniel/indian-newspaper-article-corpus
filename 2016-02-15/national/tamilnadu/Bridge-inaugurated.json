    "text": "Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday inaugurated a new bridge across the Cauvery between Vangal in Karur district and Mohanur in Namakkal district through video conferencing.\n\nSoon after the inauguration, Karur district Collector T.P. Rajesh and Members of Legislative Assembly V. Senthil Balaji and S. Kamaraj visited the bridge.\n\nThe bridge, constructed at a cost of Rs.43.50 crore for a length of 1377.60 meters, is a boon to the people of Vangal and several villages like Velayuthampalayam, Thalavapalayam to reach Mohanur in Namakkal district by travelling for just three km. Since there was no bridge, they had to travel for 36 km via Thavittupalayam-Velur to reach Mohanur. Mr. Rajesh said the bridge was thrown open for traffic immediately. Private and public transport carriers would be allowed.",
