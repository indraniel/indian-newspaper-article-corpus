Even the dialogues were delivered in the form of songs.\n\nLater stalwarts such as Sankaradas Swamigal and Pammal Sambanda Mudaliar brought a big change to the theatre scenario by introducing dialogues and songs in the dramas. They themselves authored and directed many dramas in the new format.\n\nSankaradas Swamigal alone authored more than 60 dramas, which brought him name and fame across the globe. \u2018Pavalakodi\u2019 was a famous drama authored by Swamigal and the department picked up this particular drama for imparting training to the budding artistes.\n\nThe drama explained the various sequences involving Arjuna after the Mahabaratha war. As it had a large number of characters, all the participants were given one role or the other.\n\nThe drama had many songs, and those who had talent in both singing and acting got plump roles.\n\nSwamigal gave many important and progressive messages through the drama to the whole society even many decades ago. The drama had the message of how male domination will play havoc to the society. It also explained the ill-effects of man marrying many women.\n\nFor the people who love comedy, it had a lot of comedy scenes.\n\nMany famous troupes never evinced interest in staging \u2018Pavalakodi\u2019 as they had to spend a lot for costume, settings, lighting arrangements. The department managed the same thanks to the patronage of the State Government.\n\nWhat brought delight to the old timers was the use of all the lyrics penned by Swamigal himself such as \u201cManthiri Pavala Sena...\u201d; \u201cPaandiya Kumariyana Paavai Alliye...\u201d; \u201cAzhagiya Mathimugane, Yen Aruginil Vaa Magale...\u201d; \u201cIlavarasaragiya Beemane, Namathi Raajiyangal Sugama.....\u201d in the drama staged here.\n\nSwami used Western, Hindustani, Carnatic, and classical musical forms for the songs. The drama also had Thevaram and folk songs.\n\nRaja Mohammad, a renowned theatre personality from Madurai, imparted specialised training in singing and C.S. Muthukrishnan in delivering dialogues.\n\nSampathkumar of Dindigul, a drama artiste and harmonium player, imparted training in rendering the lyrics.\n\nIt was the comedy scenes which stole the limelight. Devi, who did the role of \u2018Alli\u2019, Mathappan who acted as \u2018Arjuna\u2019, Pazhanisami who brought the character of \u2018Krishna\u2019 alive, and Kalaivani in the role of \u2018Subathrai\u2019 excelled among the actors.",
