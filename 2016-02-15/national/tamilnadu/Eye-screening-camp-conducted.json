Underlining the importance of protecting the eyes, Dr. Kannappan said that the conservancy workers should use the protection glasses while using acid for cleaning purposes. This will help in protecting the eyes.\n\nDr. Ranganathan, Project Manager, District Blindness Control Society, said that the habit of self-medication for eye ailments will lead to serious consequences. Workers will even face the danger of losing total vision.\n\nWhenever the workers face irritation in the eyes, they should immediately rush to ophthalmologists without applying drops on their own, Dr. Ranganathan said.",
