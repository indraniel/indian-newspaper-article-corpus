    "text": "The Madras High Court has directed Central government to consider a representation made by an association to revoke the ban on fishing and trading sea cucumber which was introduced in 2000.\n\nJustice R. Subbaiah made the order on a plea moved by Nagai Seafoods Catching Association. The judge directed the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Animal Husbandry Dairying and Fisheries, and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to pass suitable orders on the representation within three months.\n\nAccording to the petitioner though there is a ban, the Zoological Survey of India which was commissioned to undertake studies on assessment of sea cucumber in Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar conducted a study in 2011 and 12 and recommended alternative methods of conservation rather than a ban.\n\n\u201cBut the government has failed to implement the recommendations which are in tune with recommendations of Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations and lift the ban,\u201d the association said.",
