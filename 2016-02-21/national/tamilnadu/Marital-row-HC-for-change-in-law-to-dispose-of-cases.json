    "text": "Noting that keeping a case pending, particularly a matrimonial dispute by one of the litigants, amounts to harassment to the other, the Madras High Court said and directed a family court here to dispose of a 13-year-old case in eight weeks.\n\n\u201cWhen justice is delayed in cases of matrimonial disputes, leaving the parties to the litigation in constant emotional disturbance, relentless worries, paves the way for multiplicity of proceedings,\u201d Justice S. Vimala said while hearing a civil revision petition seeking a direction to the III Additional Court at Chennai to dispose of a matrimonial dispute within a fixed timeframe. The issue pertains to a petition moved before the family court seeking to declare the marriage between a couple null and void. \u201cDespite the judges burning the midnight oil, they are not able to clear the pendency, because of the attitude of the parties, procedural flexibility, and pre-litigation settlement not being utilised,\u201d the judge said. To find a solution, Justice Vimala recommended that the issue should be discussed in judicial academies, thereby either bringing a change in law or the procedure.",
