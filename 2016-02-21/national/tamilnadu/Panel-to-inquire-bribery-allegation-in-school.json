    "text": "A three-member committee has been formed as per a Collector order to inquire into the allegations of bribe made in National Cooperative Sugar Mill (NCSM) Higher Secondary School in 15B Metupatti near Alanganallur.\n\nN. Kasthuri, who was working as a teacher on contract in the school for about six years, had filed a complaint to the Collector alleging that some officials in the mill demanded Rs. 15 lakh to appoint her as postgraduate assistant in an existing vacancy at the school. She had alleged in her complaint that as she could not pay Rs. 15 lakh, another woman who paid the money was appointed in the first week of February.\n\nShe had told in her complaint that she had also filed a complaint to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption police and School Education Department but no action had been taken.\n\nIn a separate complaint filed to the Collector, N. Palanichamy, State president of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers\u2019 Association and an Executive Committee Member of NCSM Board, said that appointment of teachers must have been done only after decision and approval from the Board. \u201cHowever, the issue was never discussed in the board and done in a clandestine manner,\u201d he said.\n\nCollector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that he had formed a committee with a Revenue Divisional Officer, District Educational Officer (DEO) and Special Officer (SO) from NCSM. \u201cI have asked them to conduct a thorough enquiry and submit report within a week. Stringent action will be taken if allegations are found to be true,\u201d he said.",
