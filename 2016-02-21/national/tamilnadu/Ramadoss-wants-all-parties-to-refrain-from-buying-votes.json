Ramadoss has urged all political parties in the state to assure that they will not give money for securing votes in the ensuing Assembly election.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Saturday, he said that the most vital individual right in the democracy is the right to vote which is precious. But the culture of buying vote is very high in the State which is non-prevalent in North India. \u201cBoth the parties enforced the culture on the people and the crime is committed knowingly\u201d, he added. He said that the party has taken up the issue with the Election Commission and wanted all the parties in the State to give assurance that they will desist from buying votes. The leader said that \u2018bogus\u2019 electors in the list is a new trend and wanted all parties to identify such electors and remove it from the electors roll. \u201cFake electors are against the democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Ramadoss said that Supreme Court\u2019s order in the disproportionate wealth case is expected in March or in the first week of April and said that the court will confirm John Michael D\u2019Cunha\u2019s order after which the Chief Minister cannot contest the election. He termed the sticker-pasting in the garland placed on the body of Sepoy Ganesan was a political indecency to the core and the AIADMK is the number one in doing so.Mr. Ramadoss said that the Rs. 150-crore Super Specialty Hospital established in Salem was not fully utilised and urged the centre to convert it into All India Institute of Medical Sciences.",
