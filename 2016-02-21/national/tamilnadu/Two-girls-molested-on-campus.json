This is not the first time students are flagging concerns over security arrangements at the university campus.\n\nThe unknown persons who came in a two-wheeler were said to be in the campus for more than six hours orally abusing the girl students. The students alleged that at 6.30 p.m, one of the them got down from the bike and physically molested a student of the Department Food and Nutrition. Another student was molested at 7.45 p.m near the Girls\u2019 Hostel in the campus.\n\nA large number of students gathered at Gate Number 2 at the University campus around 8.30 p.m. on Friday. They wanted the security in the campus to be beefed up. They alleged that despite lodging a complaint with the security personnel in the evening, about the mischief makers, no action was taken. \u201cThe hostel security staff\u2019s attitude was lackadaisical. The chief warden did not come to the spot,\u201d Jishnu. E.N, Secretary, Pondicherry University Students\u2019 Council, said. The protest went on till late night Friday. \u201cThe vice-chancellor stepped in at 11.30 p.m. and promised to address the issue,\u201d added Jishnu.\n\nTamilvanan, a student of Pondicherry Central University and supporter of Ambedkar Students Association, said: \u201cThere are at least 2000 students in the campus. The girls visit the library or shop within the campus. As the incident has occurred close to the hostels, it is very unsafe for them. .\u201d Jishnu added that instead of considering this incident as a security lapse, the administration would attempt to curb the freedom of girls in the name of security.\n\n\u201cThis should not happen this time. The library will be open till 10 p.m. and students should be allowed to access it ,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen The Hindu spoke to the chief warden Professor K.Ilamathy Janakiraman, she said: \u201cI was not in town when the students called me to inform about the incident. I spoke to the chief warden of the boys\u2019 hostel to immediately address the issue. I reached Puducherry only by 11 p.m. but could not drive over to the University immediately. However, the Vice Chancellor met the students and informed me that that a meeting would be held on Saturday morning,\u201d she said.\n\nStudents staged protests till late night on Friday demanding better security arrangements",
