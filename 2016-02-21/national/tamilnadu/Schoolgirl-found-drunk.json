She was sent home. School Education Department officials conducted an enquiry over the incident. A top official said, \u201cWe have to ascertain what led her to do this. She might have indulged in the act due to peer pressure.\u201d or inspired by characters shown in films. Anyhow, this issue has to be handled with much care. Appropriate remedial measure will be taken to correct the child.\u201d",
