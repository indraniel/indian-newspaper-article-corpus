Lee Chengalvarayan Naicker Trust.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and S. Vaidyanathan made the order on a plea moved by the sitting trustees of the organisation that the court failed to hear them before passing the order.\n\nGiving liberty to the petitioners to suggest names of former judges of the court, on whom they have trust and faith, to discharge the duties of the Trustee-cum-Chairman, the Bench posted the matter to February 25 for further hearing.",
