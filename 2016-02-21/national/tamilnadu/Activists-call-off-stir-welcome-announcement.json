The removal of the \u2018destitute\u2019 clause and the setting up of a committee to monitor the implementation of welfare schemes are moves in the right direction,\u201d said S. Nambu Rajan, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled & Caregivers.\n\nOn setting up of a State coordination committee headed by Social Welfare Minister, Smitha Sadasivan, member of the Disability Rights Alliance, Tamil Nadu, questioned what had happened to the State coordination committee for so long.\n\n\u201cThe committee had earlier been set up but has not been functioning for several years. Why has the government not been transparent about the committee and its procedures so far,\u201d she asked.",
