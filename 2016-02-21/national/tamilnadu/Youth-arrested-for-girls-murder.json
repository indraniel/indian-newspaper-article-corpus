    "text": "Madurai rural police on Saturday arrested a 19-year-old boy for the sexual assault and murder of an 18-yer-old nursing student at Panaiyur on Wednesday.\n\nPolice sources said that the youngster allegedly committed the murder after he was spurned by the girl on a few occasions.\n\nThe girl, who had gone to graze cattle, was found murdered near the village on Wednesday evening. Preliminary investigation revealed that the girl was strangulated with her dupatta and there were indications of attempt to rape.\n\nA special team was formed by Superintendent of Police Vijayendra S. Bidari soon after the murder. While the police initially suspected a person in the locality, who had already been booked twice for sexual assault, his involvement was later ruled out.\n\nSubsequent investigations pointed at the youngster who has been arrested now. Mr. Bidari said that the girl\u2019s family were tenants in a house owned by the family of the arrested youth.\n\nHe said that the boy had tried to misbehave with the girl a few days before the murder which resulted in a scuffle.\n\nPolice sources said that, on the day of the murder, the boy, who was working in a local shop, came to know that the girl had taken leave from her college and was going alone for grazing the cattle.\n\nHe allegedly followed and attacked her with the intention of raping her. As the girl resisted his move, he allegedly strangulated her with her dupatta, police said.\n\nSources said that the boy had been booked under IPC Sections 302 (for murder) and Section 376 (for rape or rape attempt).",
