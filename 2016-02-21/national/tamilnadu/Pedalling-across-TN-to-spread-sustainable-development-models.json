Barathi Kannan is criss-crossing the State on a cycle with the ideas he strongly believes in.\n\nThe expedition named \u2018Ride for right to save Tamil Nadu-2016\u2019 started from Tambaram on February 6. He plans to ride up to Kanyakumari touching all the districts in the State.\n\nThough he has no rigid route plan, the first phase of his journey would reach Coimbatore touching villages and towns of various districts. Then he will move forward to Kanyakumari.\n\nMr. Kannan was in Tiruvannamalai on Thursday. The 30-year-old advocate told The Hindu that it would take about 70 days to complete the journey.\n\nWhen asked what inspired him to take up such a journey Mr. Kannan said that generally the State looked at Chennai as a development model and mark of prosperity. \u201cBut the recent rain and flood proved us to be wrong and displayed how the \u2018development\u2019 made Chennai unsafe for people. Corporate ate away chunks of wetland and mindless development downgraded and destroyed water bodies in and around Chennai. It actually nudged me to take up the expedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever Chennai is not alone in facing the onslaught of issues that threaten environmental safety of the State. Issues like Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, methane exploration plan in delta, iron ore mining project in Kavuthi and Vediyappan Hills near Tiruvannamalai, GAIL gas pipeline project through agricultural lands of western Tamil Nadu etc. are threatening to leave huge adverse impacts on the environmental safety of Tamil Nadu. I wanted to personally experience the plight of people regarding the environmental issues and take the message to people of other regions through this journey. I travel through towns and villages learning and speaking about the issues we face. I meet students, farmers and other sections. Likeminded people and organisations make arrangements to meet people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was touched when school children, after listening to my speech, come forward to take an oath not to use plastics in a few places,\u201d he added. Cuckoo movement for children arranged his programmes in Tiruvannamalai.\n\nC.R. Barathi Kannan is\n\ncriss-crossing the State on a cycle to meet the people",
