Bilmoria, a runner who founded the Dawn to Dusk marathon that takes place in the city every year. And, while running is one of the best ways to see the city, runners say, small trips in various locations are fun too.\n\nIn September 2014, schoolteacher Ashwin Prabhu travelled with his wife and child to run the Berlin marathon, but also spent a week looking around the city.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, I have two different interests \u2014 running and travelling, and doing something like this allows me to bring them both together,\u201d he said. Up next is a three-week trip for the London marathon in April. \u201cWhile I am running in London to raise funds, we\u2019re also planning to travel a little in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Vaishali Dhanda, her first run was practically a honeymoon run \u2014 just two months after her wedding, in Auroville. Since then, she and her husband Shameek Dhanda, also a runner, have travelled to various parts of the country, including Delhi, Hyderbabad, Mumbai and Coimbatore, and have generally taken an extra day or two to enjoy sightseeing, said the 36-year-old.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a mini-holiday and it\u2019s a great break,\u201d she said.\n\nGauri Jayaram, founder, Active Holiday Company, a tour operator specialising in marathon tours that sees many runners from Chennai, said that about 30 to 40 per cent of the runners extend their trips to sightsee.\n\n\u201cWith the running scene evolving in India, more runners want enjoyable experiences on their trips in addition to accomplishing their personal goals,\u201d she said.\n\nLater this year, K. Govindarajan, whose entire family \u2014 wife, daughters and son \u2014 runs, is planning to go to either Dubai or Singapore. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a holiday and a run for a week or 10 days,\u201d says the IT professional.\n\nFor many families, an event such as a marathon is the icing on the cake of a great holiday",
