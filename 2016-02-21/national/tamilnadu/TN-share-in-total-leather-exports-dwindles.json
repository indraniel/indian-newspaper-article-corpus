Venkatachalapathy\n\nFifteen years ago, the State accounted for 65 to 70 per cent of the country\u2019s leather exports, while it is 38 per cent now, raising the need for the government to establish leather parks, encourage domestic investors, and revisit its policy of freezing new licenses, according to M. Rafeeque Ahmed, chairman, Council for Leather Exports.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why our share in total leather exports reduced is the rapid growth of the leather sector in States such as Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe industry has grown exponentially in places such as Kanpur, Agra and Noida,\u201d he told reporters during the sidelines of the certificate distribution ceremony of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for the government to re-look into this policy of freezing licenses and see how technology can be adapted to ensure that ground water is not affected. This is required to improve the production sector,\u201d he said.\n\nScope for improvement\n\nMr. Ahmed said that the State government could open leather parks to aid in the development of the sector. \u201cThings should be made easy for investors, and at the same time, domestic investors should be encouraged. Leather industries cannot be concentrated in one district, and should be expanded to other places too,\u201d he added.\n\nDistricts such as Perambalur and Krishnagiri could be viable options for this expansion, he said.\n\nBrazil, China evince interest\n\n\u201cAs per the Government of India\u2019s direction, we visited five countries \u2013 China, Brazil, Germany, Italy and USA \u2013 to attract investors. We explained to possible investors on why they should come to India and invest in the leather sector, the available labour force, wages and taxation,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing this, Brazil and China have shown more interest to invest in India, while the U.S. has promised to discuss with manufacturers to visit the country. \u201cWe have got three to four queries so far,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the last four months, there has been a slowdown globally, with exports down by 10.2 per cent. Hence, even the ban on cow slaughter has not had an impact on the leather sector, he observed.\n\nStressing the need for creating jobs, and not just train people, he said more investment should be brought. \u201cThe Government of India is ready to provide up to Rs. 125 crore as subsidy if the State government identifies land for establishing mega leather clusters,\u201d he added.",
