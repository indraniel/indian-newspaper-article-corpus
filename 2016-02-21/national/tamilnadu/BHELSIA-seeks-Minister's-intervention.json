    "text": "The BHEL Small and Medium Industries Association (BHELSIA) has appealed to the Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industries Nirmala Sitharaman to intervene to bring about certain policy changes in the BHEL\u2019s procurement policy.\n\nIn a representation submitted to the Minister during an interaction with her, S. Ashok Sundaresan, president, BHELSIA, said there were 500 engineering ancillary units in Tiruchi serving the BHEL and the critical power sector. Earlier, they were suffering due to recession and lack of orders.\n\nAlthough BHEL is getting more orders now, small and medium enterprises would turn sick despite the improvement in the public sector major\u2019s fortunes unless some policy changes were made, he said.\n\nAmong the major demands putforth by the association was that the BHEL should quote the internal estimate price in their tenders for products. Due to under-quoting by non-serious businessmen, the units were turning sick. BHEL should accept the finished products in Tiruchi as was the practice until a few years ago.\n\nMSMEs are now being asked to ship the products to the site and logistics arrangements are beyond the capacity of MSMEs. It increases the working capital cycle. If projects go on hold, BHEL should not ask the MSME vendors to hold production or delivery.\n\nJob loading system in Valves Department should be streamlined, the association demanded.",
