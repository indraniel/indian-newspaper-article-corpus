    "text": "Slamming the reported remarks of a BJP MP that farmers\u2019 suicides were a \u201cfashion\u201d, the Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association called upon the Union Government to fix attractive minimum support prices to prevent farmer suicides.\n\n\u201cUnless the farmers get good remuneration from the crops, their financial troubles will not end. The government authorities who show urgency to implement Pay Commission recommendations should show the same enthusiasm to implement the Farmers Commission\u2019s suggestions too\u201d, pointed out C. Nallasami, secretary of the association.\n\nAccording to him, the minimum support price should be calculated as per the report given by the Farmers Commission headed by M.S. Swaminathan.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the minimum support price should be the sum of the cost of cultivation for respective crop plus 50 per cent of that cost\u201d, he said.\n\nThe government machinery should address the other problems, too, pertaining to irrigation and post-harvest management if the enthusiasm of farmers have to be sustained.",
