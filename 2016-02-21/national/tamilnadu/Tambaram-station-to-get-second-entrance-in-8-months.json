Krishnaswamy\n\nWork on the second entrance to Tambaram railway station from the Velachery Main Road, which began recently, is expected to be completed in eight months. Once it is opened, the second entrance will benefit passengers coming from Selaiyur, Kamarajapuram and some parts of Chitlapakkam and Madambakkam.\n\nAccording to railway sources, senior officials of the Chennai Division inspected the site in June last year to identify the bottlenecks. Certain encroachments have to be removed, sources said.\n\nRecently, two cycle stands have been removed and a pre-paid auto booth has been relocated.\n\n\u201cThe second entrance to Tambaram railway station from the Velachery Main Road side is an important railway project. It will reduce congestion at the main entrance of the station. The entrance will be opened later this year,\u201d said a senior official. \u201cThe two-wheeler sheds, which had been removed, would become operational in the coming days,\u201d he said. The station sees a daily traffic of 90 mail, express and passenger trains and over 240 EMU train services in addition to a footfall of more than one lakh commuters.\n\nThe project, which is being taken up at a cost of Rs. 1.83 crore, includes provision of a two-way road, a ramp, lighting and a roundabout for vehicles to enter and leave the station. Provision of a room for the overhauling of the vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) at the EMU workshop on the western side is part of the improvement works planned.\n\nPaving bays 10 and 11 at a cost of Rs. 87.97 lakh is another development work that has been taken up for the benefit of cargo movers.",
