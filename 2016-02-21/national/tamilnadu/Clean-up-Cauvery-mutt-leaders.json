The resolution demanded that the Centre must allocate special funds to cleanse the Cauvery on the lines of the project to clean the Ganga.\n\nThe meet demanded that the Centre and the State governments must fund the Hindu Kailash Yatris like they do for those Muslims who undertake the Haj and the Christians who want to visit Jerusalem.\n\nThe three-day conference that ended on Saturday wanted the Centre to declare Kumbakonam as Heritage City and extend all due benefits for the welfare of the pilgrims and townsmen.",
