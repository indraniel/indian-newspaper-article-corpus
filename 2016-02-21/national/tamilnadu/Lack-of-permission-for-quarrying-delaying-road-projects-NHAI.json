    "text": "Lack of permission for quarrying blue metal and earth are slowing down the progress of National Highways projects, including widening of Dindigul-Theni, Krishnagiri\u2013Tindivanam and Madurai-Ramanathapuram highways.\n\n\u201cIt is also leading to cost escalation. Since we are pressuring contractors to finish up, they say they are getting the material from other sources. They ask us to talk to the State government to get permission,\u201d said V. Chinna Reddy Chief General Manager (Technical), National Highways Authority of India.\n\nResidents, motorists and political parties have been demanding that the Dindigul-Theni project on the NH 45 E be completed. It is being carried out at a cost of Rs. 331 crore. The 182-km-long Krishnagiri-Tindivanam project is being carried out at a cost of Rs. 624 crore. Widening of the Madurai- Ramanathapuram (connecting Paramakudi), whose foundation stone was laid last year at a cost of Rs. 1,387 crore too, is progressing slowly. Recently, Union Minister for Road Transport and Shipping Nitin Gadkari wrote to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, urging her to look into issues pertaining to land acquisition, utility shifting, forest clearances and quarry permissions. Mr. Reddy said the NHAI needed the cooperation of the State government to finish projects on time.\n\nThe list of projects that are progressing slow, including widening of Chennai-Tada and Ennore Expressway has been furnished to the State. The contractor of the Chennai-Tada project wanted to opt out as he has been unable to complete it. Similarly, a bottleneck at NTO Kuppam is withholding the completion of the Ennore Expressway.\n\nList of affected projects in the State has been furnished to the government",
