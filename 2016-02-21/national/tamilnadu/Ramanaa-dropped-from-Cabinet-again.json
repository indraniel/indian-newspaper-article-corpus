Rosaiah has also accepted the recommendation of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to allot the portfolio to P. Mohan, Minister for Rural Industries and Labour in addition to the portfolio he holds.\n\nMr. Ramanaa has also been relieved from his party post of AIADMK party Tiruvallur (West) secretary with immediate effect. Kancheepuram (north) district secretary and MLA Walajabad P. Ganesan will hold additional charge, said party general secretary and Chief Minister Ms. Jayalalithaa in a communication.\n\nThis is the second time that Mr. Ramanaa has been removed from the Cabinet.\n\nThe Tiruvallur MLA, had been a Minister since the AIADMK returned to power in 2011 and held the portfolio of Handlooms and Textiles, Environment and Forests, and later of Revenue.\n\nMs. Jayalalithaa dropped him from the Cabinet in May 2014 when he was Commercial Taxes Minister.\n\nHe was re-inducted in September that year after Madhavaram MLA M. Moorthy was removed from the Council of Ministers.\n\nWith elections to the Assembly expected to be announced shortly, this perhaps is the last time that Ms. Jayalalithaa shuffles her Cabinet in the present stint.",
