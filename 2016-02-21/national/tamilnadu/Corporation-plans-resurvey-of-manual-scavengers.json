    "text": "They can register their names at the designated centres\n\nThe health officers in the Corporation of Madurai have planned to carry out a resurvey of the number of manual scavengers in the city from February 22 to 24.\n\nIn a bid to prevent manual scavenging, the Central and State governments have taken a number of steps to rehabilitate persons, who were hired to clean septic tanks without following safety measures.\n\nSince, it was not only unhygienic and hazardous, but claimed lives in many incidents, the officials have intensified the measures and have planned to collect information and rehabilitate such persons.\n\nCity Health Officer Yasodha Mani said that the Corporation had conducted a survey in 2014 appealing to the manual scavengers to voluntarily come forward, register and self-declare. However, none turned up. Hence, the resurvey had been planned now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Corporation officials in a press release said that manual scavengers could register their names at the designated centres with the health office/sanitary inspector office in Anaiyur, Ponnagaram, Thangaraj Salai, K. Pudur, Avaniapuram, Iravadanallur, Thiruparankundram and Melavasal.\n\nIt may be recalled, three workers died when they were cleaning a septic tank near TNHB Colony at Avaniapuram about two months ago. While the public and a few Opposition parties demanded the arrest of Corporation officers and refused to accept the bodies, they were pacified. For their part, the police maintained that the case was under investigation.",
