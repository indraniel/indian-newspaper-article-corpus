Arockiam, district coordinator of JACTTO, said that their key demands were to reinstate the old pension scheme by cancelling the new contributory pension scheme and to revise the salary of secondary grade teachers on a par with Central government schools.\n\nJACTTO also demanded the appointment of special officers in schools for implementation of various government schemes like free laptops, textbooks and bicycles as considerable amount of time of teachers was being spent for these schemes instead of teaching.\n\nMr. Arockiam said that the human chain protest was in continuation of the three-day protests they carried out in three weeks in front of all Collectorates in the State.\n\nJACTTO organisers said that their next protest would be at the Secretariat in Chennai on February 25.\n\nIt has to be noted that two of the 24 associations, which were part of JACTTO, had shifted to the camp of Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association (TNGEA) to participate in the indefinite strike which went on till Saturday. JACTTO refused to participate in that strike.",
