    "text": "Renewable energy should be harnessed wherever it was possible, said Ramesh Kymal, vice-chairman, CII, Tamil Nadu State Council.\n\nAddressing a conference on power and renewable energy organised by the CII-Thoothukudi here, he said that over 9,000 mw of solar energy and 3,000 mw of wind energy would be generated in the country this year.\n\nThe Centre had set a target of generating 1.75 lakh mw of solar and wind energy by 2020.\n\nC. Murugeswaran, resource person, said that the State government should encourage private players, who had invested huge sums of money in the power industry by purchasing power from them rather than drawing power from other States. Besides, the government should permit TN-based generators to sell excess power to other States.",
