    "text": "N. Harish, the 2009-batch IPS officer who was found dead in the Police Officers\u2019 Mess here on Thursday, reportedly died of choking, police sources said on Saturday. Investigators, quoting doctors who conducted the post-mortem, said preliminary findings indicated that the death was due to choking caused either by a block in the windpipe or a \u2018laryngospasm\u2019, a condition that leads to brief spasm of the vocal chords, making it difficult to speak or breathe, police sources said.\n\nThis dispels the suspicion that the officer committed suicide by consuming an overdose of anti-depressant pills, they added. Parrying questions whether the post-mortem confirmed the suspicion that the IPS officer consumed liquor and anti-depressant pills, a senior police official said forensic opinion on viscera examination was awaited.\n\n\u201cViscera analysis is done to rule out poisoning. After Harish did not respond to calls or open the door, police used an alternative key to open another door to enter the room. He was found dead on the bed. Yes, liquor bottles and anti-depressant tablets were found in the room,\u201d he said.\n\nThe body was handed over to the family after post-mortem on Friday. Harish\u2019s family denied reports that he was addicted to alcohol.\n\n\u201cWe are perusing the mobile phone calls of the officer. Details of the food served at dinner on Wednesday have been sought,\u201d the official added.\n\n\u201cThis dispels the suspicion that the officer committed suicide by consuming an overdose of anti-depressant pills\u201d",
