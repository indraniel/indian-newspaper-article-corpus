    "text": "With time running short, residents of about 600 tenements along Perumpallam irrigation canal have sent a petition directly to the Madras High Court praying for a directive to the Public Works Department to desist from proceeding with its eviction plan for the next three months.\n\nThe residents are reconciled to the eventuality of vacating their dwellings, but say that moving out at this juncture would jeopardise the education of hundreds of school and college-going students.\n\nHundreds of the residents in the tenements along the canal that are considered encroachments converged at a playground in Laksmi Garden Colony near Rangampalayam to signify combined submission of their petition to the Madras High Court.\n\nTheir repeated representations to the district administration and Public Works Department did not bear fruit as there was no scope for the executive machinery to disobey the court directive for time-bound eviction.\n\nAccording to the residents, they have received notices and are expected to take away their belongings by this month-end.\n\nMost of the bread-winners in these families consisting of daily labourers exuded hope that their predicament would be considered by the High Court.\n\nAdvocates espousing their cause expected the district administration to expedite the process of identifying an alternative location for providing title deeds to the displaced people.",
