The family members rushed him to a private hospital, where he is being treated.\n\nShashikumar had produced a Kannada movie Half Mental , at a cost of about Rs. 3.25 crore.\n\nFor a year-and-a-half, he had been trying to release it, but was unable to do so because of non-availability of dates with distributors and theatres.\n\nLoan\n\nAccording to the police, Shashikumar, who had already taken a huge loan for his film, was asked to arrange for Rs. 80 lakh for its release. This could be the reason he attempted to kill himself, the police said.\n\nIndustrialist critical\n\nA 35-year-old man was found lying on a pavement frothing in the mouth on Rhenius Street, Richmond Town, on Friday morning.
