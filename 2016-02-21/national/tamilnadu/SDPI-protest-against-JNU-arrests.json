Mujibur Rahman, demanded the immediate release of students, including JNU Students Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, and withdrawal of sedition charges against them.\n\nStating that the arrests were an attack on freedom of expression, the SDPI members accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of stifling dissent in universities and other educational institutions.\n\nMadurai city police had not provided permission for the protest until Friday following which the SDPI had said that it would protest without permission near Tirupparankundram Road on Saturday evening. However, the police granted permission to conduct the protest on Saturday morning at South Gate.",
