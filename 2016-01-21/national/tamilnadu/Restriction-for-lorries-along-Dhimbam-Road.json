    "text": "The police have put up a board at Bannari warning against lorries that are carrying more than the permitted load, against using the road.\n\nThe board was necessary as there have been a spate of accidents causing disruption of traffic for several hours at a stretch each time in the recent months. Disruption of traffic affects several hundreds of travellers since the road on the ghat section, a National Highway, links Tamil Nadu with Karnataka.\n\nNegotiating the bend becomes difficult for heavily loaded vehicles, and they eventually break down, hindering movement of hundreds of vehicles on either sides. It takes at least a few hours for clearing the stranded lorries. The ghat section with 27 bends runs to a distance of 14 km, and is quite steep at some bends, particularly at the 6th, 9th, 20th, 24th, and 26th bends.\n\nThe initiatives taken by the Transport Department to have weighbridges installed at Bannari and Dhimbam have not materialised as yet.\n\nA proposal for the weigh bridges was sent to the Transport Commissioner by the District Road Safety Committee.\n\nThe Transport Department has been carrying out periodic sensitisation programs for drivers using the stretch, particularly those driving multi-axle lorries that carry maximum load.",
