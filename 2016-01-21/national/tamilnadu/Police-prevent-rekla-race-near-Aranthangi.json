However, the organisers allegedly refused to budge, forcing the police to put up temporary barricades to prevent the race. Following this, the organisers entered into argument with the police.\n\nA group of youngsters, assembled at the venue, reportedly hurled stones at the police vehicle and a bus, damaging its windscreens. However, no one was injured.\n\nThe police registered cases against 13 persons including, owners of 11 rekla carts and the organisers. The race was held from Vairivayal to Nagudi road and the carts had almost returned to the finishing point when the police intervened and stopped it.",
