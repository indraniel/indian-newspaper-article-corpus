The families were primarily involved in agriculture.\n\n\u201cThis is the first \u2018ghar wapsi\u2019 ceremony to be organised in Vellore district. These persons had converted to Christianity nearly eight to 10 years ago. They were re-converted to Hinduism during the ceremony,\u201d said K. Magesh, zonal president, Hindu Munnani, Vellore.\n\nHe disclosed that Hindu Munnani\u2019s branch committee in the area had got in touch with the family members and spoke to them about returning to their \u201cmother\u201d religion. \u201cThey also expressed the desire to return to Hinduism. So, we arranged a ritual that was attended by several villagers,\u201d he said.\n\nHindu Munnani\u2019s State organiser K. Bhaktavachalam was present on the occasion.\n\nThe organisation plans to organise more such events across the district.\n\n\u201cWe will be going back to the same village as hundreds of them had been converted several years ago. We will organise the rituals in various parts of the district to bring back people to Hinduism,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Magesh said,\u201cMany are volunteering for re-conversion, while we are also approaching persons who had converted from Hinduism. We had not conducted \u2018ghar wapsi\u2019 ceremonies earlier as it caused too much of political controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nHindu Munnani plans to re-convert more persons at Latheri in Katpadi",
