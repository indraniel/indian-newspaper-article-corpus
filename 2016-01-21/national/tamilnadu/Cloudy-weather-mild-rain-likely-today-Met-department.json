    "text": "Cloudy weather over the city and mild showers in the peripheral areas are likely to continue on Thursday too.\n\nOn Wednesday, many residents woke up to a thick layer of fog that persisted well beyond 8 a.m. However, the Meteorological department said that it was usual for such fog cover during the winter months. The city will experience an increase in cloud cover on Thursday and this would lead to warmer night temperature \u2014 at least two or degrees above normal.\n\nConvergence of moist air from the Arabian sea and dry winds from central India have led to cloudy weather over the city. There may be isolated light rains particularly in the interior parts of Tamil Nadu. Mist is likely to occur in some areas during the morning hours till Friday.\n\nY.E.A. Raj, former deputy director general of meteorology, Chennai, said \u201cFog is nothing but stratus clouds closer to the ground. This kind of weather is possible during winter. There is a need for moisture in the air for such phenomenon. Chennai may experience light rains around this weekend.\u201d\n\nThe city is yet to register its first spell of showers for the year.\n\nThere may be isolated light rains particularly in the interior parts of Tamil Nadu",
