    "text": "Nadigar Sangam president Nasser said representatives of the Tamil film industry will meet Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and urge her to expedite release of the seven convicts in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case at a press conference on Monday. \u201cWe are planning to take out a rally in support of the prisoners who have been languishing in jail for the last 25 years. In the centenary year of MGR, we hope the government will show a way for them,\u201d said Nasser, president of Nadigar Sangam.\n\nAsked why the Nadigar Sangam has taken up this issue now, he said, \u201cWe also worked during the floods. The issue of the release of seven prisoners is not a political cause at all.\u201d\n\nDirector R.K. Selvamani said the rally will also aim to raise consciousness amongst political class, who, he said, have misread the recent Supreme Court judgement in the case. \u201cWe want to highlight the fact that the judgement which prevented the release of the killers underlines that the constitutional powers remain with the State.\u201d Noted lyricist Thamarai, who represented the lyricists, said that the idea of punishment must be to reform the convicts and not about making them pay for their act. Actor Nasser was joined by representatives of other unions and associations.",
