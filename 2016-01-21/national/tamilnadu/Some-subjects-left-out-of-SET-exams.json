Swaminathan, founder secretary NET/SET Association.\n\nA. Amudavalli, head of Library Science department of the University of Madras, said a number of vacancies had to be filled and not including the subject would leave interested candidates out.\n\nBharathi Harishankar, head of Women\u2019s Studies department in University of Madras also felt that it was not right to keep out the subject.\n\nMother Teresa University Rgistrar N. Kala, however, said that these subjects would be included in the next round of test as there were not many vacancies.\n\n\u201cWhen there are less than 10 or 15 vacancies for a subject we can decide not to hold a test in those subjects. We have received permission to conduct the test for three years and will include the subjects that were left out in the next round,\u201d she added.",
