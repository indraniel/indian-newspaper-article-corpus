Elango, zonal president of Tamil Nadu College Teachers Association, a constituent of JAC, told The Hindu that they insisted on rolling back the new pension scheme. \u201cGrade pay has not been given to teachers appointed after 2006 and we want the government to give it soon. Posts of Vice Chancellors are vacant in 5 universities in the state and we want them to be filled soon,\u201d Prof. Elango said.\n\n\u201cClasses were not held in all the five arts colleges in Vellore region including those in Tiruvannamalai, Cheyyar, Gudiyatham and Wallajah apart from Vellore Muthurangam Arts College,\u201d he added.",
