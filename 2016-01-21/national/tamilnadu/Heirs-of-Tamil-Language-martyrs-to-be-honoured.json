    "text": "The fruits of supreme sacrifice by Tamils during anti-Hindi agitations in 1938 and 1965 in the development of Tamil were not realised in the present day, said P. Maniarasan, president of Tamil Desiya Periyakkam.\n\nAddressing reporters here on Wednesday, he said that about 500 youths and students lost their lives in the struggle to protect Tamil language. But, 50 years after their sacrifice English that used to be the second language only from the sixth standard had become the medium of instruction in most schools. \u201cEven government-run schools have English as medium of instruction right from class I,\u201d he said.\n\nThe movement was organising a day-long conference, \u2018Mozhipor \u2013 50\u2019, to mark the 50th year of anti-Hindi agitation at Tamukkam Ground here on Sunday.\n\nLegal heirs of martyrs and scholars would be honoured on the occasion. Several seminars on Tamil in administration, judiciary, education and spirituality would be held.\n\nThe meet would call for 80 per cent reservation in higher education, especially in professional courses, for students who had completed their schooling through Tamil medium of instruction.\n\nBesides, it wanted the history of anti-Hindi agitation to be included in school textbooks. Its general secretary K. Venkatraman was present.",
