Subbaraju, the protestors, who attempted to stage a protest, were arrested.\n\nSpeaking amidst the protestors, Prof. Subbaraju said that 3,210 teaching posts in government and aided colleges across Tamil Nadu had been vacant since May 2007 despite repeated appeals from the college teachers\u2019 associations to fill these vacancies with qualified teachers in a transparent manner.\n\nWhen the government allowed the aided college administrations to fill the vacancies in their institutions, norms were violated in the appointments, he alleged.\n\n\u201cAbove all, five universities in Tamil Nadu have been remaining \u2018headless\u2019 for the past several months following the retirement of the Vice-Chancellors. Qualified educationists having stupendous track record in their field should be handpicked for these posts in a transparent manner,\u201d Prof. Subbaraju said.
