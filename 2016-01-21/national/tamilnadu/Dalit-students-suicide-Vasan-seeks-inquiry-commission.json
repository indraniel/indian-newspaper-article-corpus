    "text": "Tamil Maanila Congress leader G.K. Vasan on Wednesday demanded constitution of an enquiry commission by the Central and Telangana governments to probe the suicide of Rohith Vemuly, a Dalit research scholar at the University of Hyderabad.\n\nAddressing reporters on the sidelines of his State-wide \u2018Makkal Santhippu\u2019 programme held in Maravankudiyiruppu near Nagercoil, Mr. Vasan said that the increasing attacks on Dalits in the country were a cause for concern. The government at the Centre and in States should take effective steps to prevent such attacks and render social justice to Dalits.\n\nThe issue should not be politicised and action should be initiated against the Vice-Chancellor of the University and the officials concerned.\n\nStating that people of Tamil Nadu wanted total prohibition, he urged the government to implement prohibition in a phased manner by reducing the number of liquor shops, sale and closure of bars.\n\nLiquor outlets situated near places of worship, educational institutions and national and State highways could be shutdown.\n\nMr. Vasan said that the Centre must take steps to lift the ban on jallikattu, which he said was attached to the culture and sentiments of the Tamils.\n\nThe NDA government was lagging behind in finding solutions to the problems faced by the people, he alleged.\n\nThanking the People\u2019s Welfare Alliance for inviting the Tamil Maanila Congress to join it, Mr. Vasan said that decisions on alliance would be taken only after knowing the wish of the cadres.",
