Rosaiah on Wednesday urged the Centre to release Rs. 17,432 crore, estimated by the State government in the supplementary memorandum, to undertake restoration work following rain and floods in the State without delay.\n\nIn his customary address to the Assembly, he appreciated Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for the flood relief work, saying that under her leadership the State machinery brought back normality in a very short span of time.\n\nMr. Rosaiah said the morale of the Tamil Nadu police was at an all-time high since it had been given a free hand to deal with crime effectively.\n\n\u201cConstant vigil, stern action and coordinated approach of the police force have enabled the State to crack the whip on anti-social elements and eliminate extremism in all forms,\u201d he said.\n\nMaking a strong case for nationalisation of inter-State rivers to optimally utilise the water resources, Mr. Rosaiah reiterated the State government\u2019s appeal for linking peninsular rivers.\n\nHe announced extension of Post Tsunami Sustainable Livelihood Programme (PTSLP) to Tiruvarur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts at an additional Rs. 320 crore.\n\nNet enrolment ratio\n\nThe initiatives implemented by the State government in education sector resulted in the Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) rising to 94.71 per cent at the secondary school level. \u201cIt is the highest in the country,\u201d he said.",
