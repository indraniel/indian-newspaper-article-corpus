Even in the Seventh Pay Commission has fixed lower scale of pay.\n\nThe Commission did not concede to any of the suggestions put forth by the association during the various sittings. They wanted Group D status to railway engineers on a par with the Union Government engineers as stated in the Department of Personnel and Training circular of 2009.",
