    "text": "Consumers getting LPG cylinders from Indian Oil Corporation\u2019s Indane in the district have to wait for three weeks since December last for refills reportedly due to short supply.\n\nThough long wait for refills is not uncommon to Indane consumers, especially during the winter, this time it has been very agonising as the waiting time has gone beyond three weeks.\n\nThey have been making repeated requests with the distributors for refills. Even after the Indane consumers registered their protests repeatedly against IOC in the monthly grievance meetings at the Collectorate, the problem still persists. \u201cInstead of getting additional loads, the distributors are now getting only one load every day. Hence, the huge backlog\u201d, a distributor said.\n\nAn official attached to IOC\u2019s LPG division said: \u201cEven as major quantity of our cylinders had to be diverted to the flood-hit northern districts since mid-December, the protest by tanker drivers worsened the situation.\u201d\n\nMost of the Indane distributors here blame senior officials for not taking sincere efforts to clear the backlog.\n\nThough Bharat Petroleum too faced a similar situation in mid-December after its bottling plant at Thoothukudi was shut down owing to unprecedented flooding, its aggressive approach led to increasing the production.\n\n\u201cThe workers had to work even on Sundays and we managed to clear the backlog to a greater extent,\u201d a Bharat Petroleum LPG distributor said. \u201cThe management, besides increasing production and supply, set a deadline for distributors to clear the backlog and we\u2019d to comply with it.\u201d\n\nAn Indane LPG distributor here said that the oil major\u2019s upcoming bottling plant with better production capacity at Gangaikondan could not be commissioned owing to \u201clegal impediments\u201d though construction was almost over. \u201cIf this plant is commissioned, the consumers will enjoy excellent services,\u201d said the distributor.",
