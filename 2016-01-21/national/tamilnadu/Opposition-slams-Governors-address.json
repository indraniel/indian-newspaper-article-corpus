Ramadoss said the entire address was \u201cdedicated to praise Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and the government\u201d.\n\nPointing to unsolved issues such as agriculture distress, formation of the Cauvery Management Board, reclamation of Katchatheevu and attacks by Sri Lankan navy on Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said the State was in the same situation as it was five years ago and there has been no progress.\n\n'Vision 2023'\n\nMDMK general secretary Vaiko said while the Governor called the \u2018Vision 2023\u2019 document an achievement of the government, not much has been done to follow up on the document as the State does not have enough funds.\n\nIt did not provide any solution to the mounting debts of the State, says Vijayakant",
