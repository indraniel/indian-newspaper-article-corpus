The partly expressed the need for reviving water bodies and removing encroachments from water bodies, forest areas and the elephant corridor, resulting in increasing human-animal conflicts.\n\nDuring the campaign, the MDMK said it was batting for the Makkal Nala Kootani and would vote for that alliance alone as it would facilitate revival of water bodies in the city and remove encroachments from the forest areas.\n\nMDMK State Youth Wing secretary V. Eswaran, who heads the awareness campaign, claimed that widespread encroachments permitted by the Dravida Munetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam as reason for the recent disastrous flooding in Chennai.\n\nHe said that the encroachment of River Noyyal, besides Kurichi and Vellalore Tanks would lead to a similar disaster in Coimbatore, but the present government was not concerned about reviving the water bodies. He added that the drying up of rivers and streams was due to encroachments.",
