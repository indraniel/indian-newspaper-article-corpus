    "text": "The Opposition DMK has slammed the corporation\u2019s proposal to hand over the operation and maintenance of the Mettur \u2013 Salem Dedicated Water Supply Scheme to a private company and termed it as corruption.\n\nThe Rs. 320.54 water scheme to supply 120 Million Litres Per Day (mld) to 60 Wards is implemented in two phases.\n\nThe Phase I was already completed and Phase II is nearing completion.\n\nRecently, the civic body floated tender inviting proposals for operating and maintaining the scheme for five years for which the civic body has planned to pay Rs. 21.59 crore from its general fund.\n\nPoor management\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the council M. Bhuvaneswari said that due to poor management, the civic body was cash-strapped as it was unable to pay the contractors and the salary for the corporation workers regularly.\n\n\u201cThough it has engineers and workers for operating and maintaining, what is the need for appointing a contractor at a huge cost,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that corruption was prevailing in the corporation and people were the worst affected due to non-implementation of welfare schemes in the last four years.\n\nCorporation officials said that inadequate man power for operating and maintaining the scheme had forced them to go for appointing a contractor. The last date for submission of bids was 3 pm on January 22. The bids will be opened at 3.30 p.m. the same day.",
