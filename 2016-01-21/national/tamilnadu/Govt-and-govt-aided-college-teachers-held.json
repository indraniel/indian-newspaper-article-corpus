    "text": "They attempt to stage road roko urging the government to amend G.O.\n\nMore than 400 teachers of various government and government-aided colleges were arrested when they attempted to stage a road roko here on Wednesday.\n\nThey were demanding that the State government bring an amendment to the G.O. issued on April 1, 2015 for the benefit of assistant professors, who joined duty from 2006 to 2011 for getting grade pay. Withdrawal of new pension scheme, filling up of vacancies in government colleges and upgrading infrastructure in colleges were their other demands. They were staging the protest near the Regional Director of Collegiate Education.\n\nDavid Livingstone, zonal secretary, Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers\u2019 Association, led the protest. Members of Association of University Teachers also participated.\n\nThey said the G.O. had no word on extending the grade pay benefit to those joined between 2006 and 2011. Though they had voiced their protest at several occasions, there was no action to amend the G.O. Hence, the government should immediately look into the issue. All the protestors were released in the evening. However, Mr. Livingstone said that they would continue the protest on Thursday.",
