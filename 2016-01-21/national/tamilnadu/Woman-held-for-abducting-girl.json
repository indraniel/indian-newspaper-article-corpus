The victim had alleged that she was kept under confinement in an apartment at Vadavalli for five days before she was abandoned near Perundurai, in Erode district on January 12. A senior police officer said that Sandhya\u2019s husband Balaji was the prime accused in the case. He is also the friend of history-sheeter, who is wanted in the triple murder at Sulur, last August. While Balaji had earlier been booked in a few prostitution cases and is under hiding, the police said that his driver and an aide were arrested a couple of days ago. Based on their confession, Sandhya was arrested.\n\nMeanwhile, Sandhya\u2019s counsel C. Muthu said that Sandhya faced sexual harassment from a few police officers in the Karumathampatty, Madukkarai and Vadavalli police stations since her husband went under hiding.",
