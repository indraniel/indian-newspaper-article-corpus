Susheela, secretary of the home.\n\nAnd so, they set up composting units, into which their garbage goes and is converted as compost. \u201cIt\u2019s been coming out very well. The rains delayed our gardening project, but we are planning to set it up soon,\u201d she says.\n\nEvery day, the city disposes of nearly 5,000 tonnes of garbage. Most of this is un-segregated and is dumped in the massive landfills in Pallikaranai and Kodungaiyur.\n\nAvvai Home, says Navneeth Raghavan of Daily Dump which sells and sets up community composting units called Aaga, is one of many organisations that are now expressing an interest in composting their waste.",
