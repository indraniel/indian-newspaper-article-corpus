    "text": "Neuroscientist demystifies two techniques devised to study, control the organ\n\nTo a thronging audience of scientists, students, engineers and doctors, Karl Deisseroth, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist, demystified two revolutionary techniques that he and his colleagues at Stanford University had devised to study and control the brain: optogenetics and CLARITY.\n\nHis lab uses some \u201crather unlikely allies\u201d from the natural world \u2013 microbial organisms and algae \u2013 organisms that are light-sensitive and help \u201cilluminate\u201d the brain to study and control it through optogenetics, he said.\n\n\u201cWe can now use certain genetic tricks to deliver genes of interest to regions of interest... We also use anatomical tricks, where, for instance, a virus carrying a gene could be injected deep into brain structure. CLARITY on the other hand creates a \u201csee-through brain\u201d \u2013 by removing the lipids that make the brain opaque \u2013 without destroying the brain structure with the help of a hydrogel.\u201d\n\nProf. Deisseroth was delivering the Sixth Annual Cell Press-TNQ India Distinguished Lectureship Series titled \u2018Illuminating the Brain\u2019 on Wednesday.\n\nThe human brain, \u201can organ of staggering complexity and beauty\u201d, also poses serious challenges when it comes to psychiatric diseases, which are typically very debilitating, chronic, and hard to treat: \u201cAmong all the fields of medicine they are certainly the least understood,\u201d Prof. Deisseroth said.\n\nMore than 200 years ago, the first scientific descriptions of psychiatric disease were starting to emerge, with the identification of the symptom domains of what was called \u201cmelancholia\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cFar, far back, there were scientists who were not psychiatrists, who were not neuroscientists, who were basic biologists studying certain aspects of the natural world and it was their work over decades that created the foundation that we were able to build on.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hero of neuroscience\u2019\n\n\u201cBreakthrough moments in science, of a transformative kind, build on the work that comes before it, and Prof. Deisseroth has emphasised this,\u201d said N Ram, Chairman, Kasturi and Sons Limited. He described Prof. Deisseroth as \u201ca hero of neuroscience\u201d who focused especially on treatment-resistant depression and autism.\n\nProf. Deisseroth, who was recently awarded the prestigious Life Sciences Breakthrough Prize for 2016, is the D.H. Chen Professor of Bioengineering and of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University.",
