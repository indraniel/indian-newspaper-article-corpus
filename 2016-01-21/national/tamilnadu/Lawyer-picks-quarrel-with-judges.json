    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here witnessed tense moments on Tuesday when advocate W. Peter Ramesh Kumar, now under suspension, \u201cpicked a quarrel\u201d with two judges seized of suo motu contempt of court proceedings initiated against him for challenging a Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and V.M. Velumani on September 16 to take action against him \u201cif it had guts.\u201d\n\nAppearing before a Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran, Mr. Kumar accused the senior judge of being biased against him since he belonged to a minority community and claimed that the other judge in the Bench was actually not inclined to hear the suo motu contempt proceedings. He also insisted that his accusation and claim must be recorded by the court.\n\nThe judges acceded to his request and recorded the two submissions before brushing them aside as \u201cintimidatory tactics that the contemnor has always adopted.\u201d They also recorded that the contemnor denied as false an observation made by them in their interim order on January 7 that he tendered apology to them when they provided audience to him in their chambers on December 10.\n\nSubsequently, rejecting his request for six weeks\u2019 time to file a reply to a show-cause notice issued in the contempt proceedings, the judges ordered that the reply must be filed by January 27. They also observed that they were giving a long rope to the contemnor though there was no necessity for the court to give time to file a reply, frame charges and then conduct trial if the contempt was in the face of the court.",
