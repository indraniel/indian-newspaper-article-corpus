    "text": "Chennai Corporation has resumed work on the Link Road and stormwater drains along the southern part of the Marina beach.\n\nThe current work covers the western part of the Link Road.\n\nWork on the seaward side of the road was stopped following protests by activists in 2014. The Chennai Corporation is planning to widen the landward side of the Link Road before the notification of elections.\n\nThe stormwater drain on the landward side of the road is expected to be constructed shortly. Local fishermen and activists have been claiming that the works are in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. The civic body had to suspend the work on the western side as the stretch is between the high tide and low tide lines, where laws prohibit any development works except those that have received the benefit of exemption.",
