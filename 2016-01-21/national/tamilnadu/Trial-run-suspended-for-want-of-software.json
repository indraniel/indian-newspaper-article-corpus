Only after it is done will we be able to continue the trial run of trains on the new stretch,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe next stretch of Chennai Metro Rail from Little Mount to Nanganallur Road may be commissioned in about six months. Though officials say this disruption of trial run will not affect the deadline, sources say it is likely to delay the process.\n\nThe track work on the stretch was completed sometime ago and it was decided to start the trial run. Currently, effort is on to complete the remaining work on the viaduct extending up to the airport, and finish the track work subsequently.\n\nAlso, they want to extend the operations from Alandur to St. Thomas Mount.\n\nChennai Metro Rail started its first service between Koyambedu and Alandur only in July last.",
