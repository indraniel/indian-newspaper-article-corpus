    "text": "Six students of Government Law College in Madurai sat on a fast on Wednesday inside the campus, condemning their suspension for involvement in the protests that were staged at the Madras High Court in September 2015.\n\nPolice entered the campus on a request from the Principal. The students alleged that it was unfair on the part of the college administration to suspend them as they had participated in a peaceful protest along with other lawyers demanding that Tamil be made a court language. They said that the government should stand by the students and the lawyers to make Tamil a court language.\n\nThey also alleged that cases were being registered against protesting students unnecessarily with the intention of spoiling their career.\n\nFierce argument broke out between the protesting students and the police when the police told them that they would be arrested if they did not give up the protest.\n\nWhile the police detained four protesting students, the other two managed to flee, and climbed on the rooftop raising slogans against the police and the college administration.\n\nThe police left the campus later with the four detained students. Police sources said that a case was yet to be registered.",
