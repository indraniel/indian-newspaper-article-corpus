    "text": "Tension prevailed at Idaiyarthavanai near Surandai in the district on Wednesday evening after the relatives of a slain youth refused to accept his headless body.\n\nAs the assailants had chopped off the head of Arumugasamy, one of the two persons killed in the gruesome murder at Pazhayakaayal near Thoothukudi on Tuesday and put it under the board carrying the picture of slain Dalit leader Pasupathi Pandian at Deivaseyalpuram as a show of revenge for his murder, the police recovered the severed part and sent it to Chennai for superimposing.\n\nHence, the police could hand over only the trunk to the relatives following the post-mortem done at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital on Wednesday. Though they received the corpse at TMC, problem started when other family members refused to receive it as it reached Idaiyarthavanai, his birthplace near Surandai in Tirunelveli district in the evening.\n\nThe agitated crowd said that they would accept the body only when the head was also handed over to them and started staging a road blockade around 5.30 p.m., ignoring repeated pleas by the police to give up the protest and accept the body.\n\nIt would take a minimum of two weeks to complete the superimposing procedure in Chennai, the police said. Hence the stalemate continued even after 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt will take a minimum of two weeks to complete the superimposing procedure in Chennai\u201d",
