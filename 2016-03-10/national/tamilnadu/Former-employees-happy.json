    "text": "Former employees of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) thermometer factory have welcomed the settlement reached between Pond\u2019s HLL Ex-Mercury Employees Welfare Association and HUL that has put an end to the long-standing issue. Association president S.A. Mahendra Babu welcomed the action taken by HUL, bringing the negotiations to a satisfactory closure. \u201cWe are pleased with all the terms of the agreement which will help ensure the long-term health and well-being of the factory's former workers. We now consider this issue to be fully resolved and have no more grievances against the company in this regard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company has also agreed to provide ex-gratia payments to 511 former workers/association members and their families towards livelihood enhancement projects and skill enhancement programmes. The former employees confirmed this as a full and final settlement of all their claims and demands. They will withdraw the petition they had filed in February 2006 in the Madras High Court. HUL too will withdraw all cases filed in the Madras High Court, he added. A similar class action suit moved by the employees for damages before the High Court of London since the company is headquartered in United Kingdom will also be withdrawn, Ms. R. Vaigai, counsel for the employees\u2019 association, said. HUL Legal and Corporate Affairs Executive Director Dev Bajpai stated that the company was glad that the issue has been resolved. \u201cThe well-being of our employees and the communities in which we operate has and will always remain paramount,\u201d he added. The petition was filed by employees more than four years after HUL had made a final settlement in November 2001.",
