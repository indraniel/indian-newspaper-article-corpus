Here, helmets, which are made for protecting people from harm, receives protection.\n\nTo help motorcyclists whose vehicles lack the provision for locking their helmets, contractors at the parking lot, opposite Railway Protection Force police station at MMC, offer to guard the helmets of the motorcyclists. They fix a sticker with some details \u2014 the number of the tokens issued to the rider and also the date and the time of parking.\n\nWhen motorcyclists return to the lot, they have to hand over the parking token and collect the helmet. The staff at the parking lot said that over 1,500 motorcycles were being parked there every day and there had been many complaints from vehicle owners about missing helmets.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances of riders taking away helmets kept on other motorcycles by mistake, but many others do it intentionally, especially after the rule making wearing helmets mandatory came into effect last year,\u201d they said.\n\nTo prevent theft, they had installed closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) and ensured safe keeping of helmets of those riders who did not have the wire lock or a permanent helmet lock attached to the rear grip above the tail light. While there are no charges fixed by the contractor or authorised by Southern Railway, the staff accept money given by the vehicle owners of their own accord. However, some motorcyclists complain that they have to pay Rs. 10 for the safe keeping of helmets.\n\nEmployees there, however, denied that they demanded money and that motorcyclists volunteered to pay small sums to the staff on duty. They said that ever since they started the safe keeping of helmets, there were no complaints of theft of the headgear.",
