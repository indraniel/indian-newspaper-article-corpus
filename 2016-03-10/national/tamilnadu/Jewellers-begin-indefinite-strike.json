    "text": "Over 3,000 jewellery shops in and around Madurai district, affiliated to Madurai Jewellers and Bullion Merchants Association, on Wednesday began an indefinite strike, protesting against the Union Budget proposal to impose one per cent Excise duty on gold sale.\n\nAssociation treasurer G. Dhakshinamoorthy said that the new proposal would be an additional burden on customers who were already paying value-added tax. Besides, the new taxation would lead to a lot of harassment of the jewellers by the officials.\n\nHe said that such a tax that existed in the past was removed only during the rule of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh.\n\nMr. Dhakshinamoorthy said that business to the tune of Rs. 150 crore was lost due to the closure of 3,000 shops during the three-day strike held earlier this week.\n\nThe indefinite strike would render some 18,000 employees jobless in the region, he added.",
