    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation petition seeking a direction to school education department officials to refrain from forcing students writing the ongoing public examinations for Class XII to remove their belts and footwear before entering the examination halls in a bid to prevent malpractices.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam refused to entertain the petition after stating that the petitioner, K. Abdul Vahabudheen of Tirunelveli district, had filed the case without any proof to substantiate his allegation of students being forced to remove their belts and footwear to dissuade them from carrying paper bits containing answers to probable questions.",
