    "text": "The commuters in the Mannargudi-Manamadurai Passenger train had a miraculous escape on Wednesday when an alert farmer detected a rail fracture on the tracks near Sambaveli village between Mannargudi and Nidamangalam and alerted the authorities.\n\nVijayan (40) noticed the rail fracture on the tracks near Sambaveli and immediately informed the nearby railway gatekeeper even as the train was approaching the spot.\n\nFortunately, the gatekeeper flashed the red flag to halt the train after which the loco pilot, the gatekeeper, and others inspected the fractured rail and then the train passed the stretch in extreme caution and reached Nidamangalam an hour and a quarter late.\n\nAs the level-crossing gate was kept closed for more than an hour, vehicles got piled up causing a huge traffic jam. The delay in movement of the Mannargudi-Manamadurai service disrupted the schedule of the Coimbatore-Mannargudi Semmozhi Express.",
