    "text": "\u201cVehicles can be monitored easily and deployed wherever necessary\u201d\n\nGlobal Positioning System devices will be fitted in couple of days in all the 60 vehicles being used by flying squads and static surveillance teams (SST) so that their movement can be tracked.\n\nEach of the 10 Assembly segments in Madurai district have been allocated three flying squads and three SSTs, which will work in eight-hour shifts.\n\nOfficials said that GPS devices were fixed in 17 vehicles till Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInspecting the vehicles fitted with the GPS device on Wednesday on the Collectorate premises, Collector and Election Officer K. Veera Raghava Rao said that GPS tracking would help in effective deployment of the teams. \u201cThe positions of the vehicles can be monitored even from my mobile phone,\u201d Mr. Rao said. \u201cIf at all we get a report that a team had not attended to a particular complaint, we can access the locations of the vehicle at that particular time to verify,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the devices would also help in quicker deployment as the vehicle closest to a place where an incident had been reported could be easily ascertained.\n\nApart from showing the vehicular position in a map, the software used for monitoring could also show details about whether the vehicle engine was on or off, whether the vehicle was moving or idle, and the average speed based on information sent by the GPS devices attached to the vehicles.\n\nThe Collector has instructed a large-sized screen to be set up at the Media Certification & Monitoring Committee (MCMC) room operating in Collectorate dedicatedly for GPS tracking of the vehicles.",
