    "text": "The Salem Railway Junction will soon get an escalator facility.\n\nThe escalator has already arrived and the work on erecting it began on Wednesday.\n\nThe escalator will be commissioned outside the junction premises behind the lift on Platform-1 (near the second parking lot) and it will be connected to the pedestrian bridge.\n\nThe commuters need not enter the junction premises for using the new facility.\n\nThe commissioning of the escalator outside the junction premises will reduce congestion inside the station, particularly on Platform-1 in a big way.\n\nThe commuters can reach Platforms 3 and 4 using a lift, and Platform 2 and 5 using stair cases from the pedestrian bridge.\n\nThe railways has proposed to convert Platform-5 into an island platform and have an escalator installed there.\n\nThe project is expected to be completed by the end of this month, railway sources said.\n\nCoimbatore is the only Junction in Salem Railway Division to have escalator facility. Escalator facility is expected to come up in Erode and Tiruppur junctions too shortly.",
