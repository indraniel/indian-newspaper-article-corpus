    "text": "A group of HIV positive persons from Karur has petitioned Chief Minister Jayalalithaa alleging that the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) was seeking to profile them by forcing them to submit their fingerprints.\n\nIn their petition, they said: \u201cTANSACS had deployed some persons at anti-retroviral therapy centres in Karur to take our fingerprints. We have been given written instructions to bring all members of our families living with HIV and submit their fingerprints. We were also told to bring five members from our family and get their fingerprints registered.\u201d\n\nThis, they said, was an invasion on their privacy and breach of confidentiality, when the law has made it clear that HIV positive persons need not declare their status.\n\nThe HIV positive persons said they were being profiled as they were receiving medicines free of cost.\n\nHowever, Karur district HIV Positive Persons Network president K. Viswanathan said the aim of the programme was to weed out duplication of addresses.\n\nA senior TANSACS official said the organisation\u2019s effort at digitising Antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme was still in preliminary stages.\n\n\u201cWe were collecting fingerprints as the idea was to make ART an online process. It would enable the registered patients to receive drugs wherever they are by simply providing their fingerprints. We did not capture their image. We wanted to ensure that there were no dropouts and if we lost some patients we would be able to bring them back to receive treatment,\u201d the official said. According to him, confidentiality of the patients would be maintained.\n\nAllege TANSACS forcing them to submit their fingerprints",
