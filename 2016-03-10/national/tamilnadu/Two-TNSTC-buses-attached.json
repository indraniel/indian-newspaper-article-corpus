    "text": "Two buses of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation buses were attached on Wednesday for failing to pay compensation to the family of an accident victim, as ordered by the court.\n\nWhen Paulraj (49) of Sankarankoil was coming to Tirunelveli in a TNSTC bus on December 28, 2013, around 10 p.m. he was allegedly thrown out of the speeding bus and got injured. Though he was admitted to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, he breathed his last on January 6, 2014.\n\nSeeking compensation for the accidental death, the victim\u2019s wife Papa, a mother of five children, filed a petition before the Second Additional Sessions Court. Judge Abdul Khader ordered the TNSTC on July 3, 2015 to pay Rs. 9.94 lakh to the family of the deceased.\n\nAs the TNSTC failed to honour the order till Wednesday, Ms. Papa approached the court again, which ordered the attachment of two buses. Subsequently, two buses were attached and taken to the TNSTC\u2019s depot at KTC Nagar here after the staff from the court pasted the attachment notice on the vehicles.",
