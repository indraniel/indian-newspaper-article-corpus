At present, vehicles coming from the southern parts of the State including Tiruchi need over three hours to cover the same stretch.\n\nAround 70 per cent of the work on the construction of Phase II of the Chennai Outer Ring Road has been completed. The work to connect Nemilicheri on NH-205 to Minjur on the Tiruvotriyur-Ponneri-Pancheti Road on a Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis began in 2014.\n\nWork on the stretch that will have one interchange, one major bridge, six minor bridges, 14 pedestrian under-passes and 13 vehicular under passes, is slated for completion in September this year.\n\nSince land acquisition is over, work is progressing at a steady pace and already, 19 km of the subgrade for the road has been laid, said a source at the Tamil Nadu Road Development company, which is the managing associate for the Rs. 1,400-crore project.\n\nThe second phase of the road passes through Mittanamalee, Vellanur, Attanthangal, Padiyanallur, Kandigai and Arumandai among other villages.\n\nVaradhan, a resident of Karunakaracheri, along which Phase I of the project from Vandalur to Nemilicheri runs, said the road has been witnessing a gradual increase in traffic since its opening. Murugappan who has invested in property in the vicinity of ORR 2, said that areas near the ORR were witnessing an increase in prices. \u201cIf rail connectivity is also ensured, it would be a great improvement,\u201d he said.",
