    "text": "Three policemen have moved the Madras High Court Bench here challenging an order passed by Tirunelveli Principal District and Sessions Court on February 8 directing Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department to register a case against them and nine others for having allegedly murdered history-sheeter S. Kittappa in a \u201cfake encounter\u201d on June 13 last.\n\nG. Sivaramakrishnan (36), Sub-Inspector of Police, Serious Crime Squad, Tirunelveli city, Shanmugavel (53), Special Sub-Inspector of Police (Law and Order), Perumalpuram Police Station, Tirunelveli, and Thangam (45), Head Constable (Law and Order), Pettai Police Station, had filed the criminal revision petition in the High Court with a plea to set aside the district court\u2019s order.\n\nPointing out that a police investigation was already under way with respect to the encounter that led to the death of the history-sheeter, the petitioners claimed that the direction given by the lower court to register a murder case on the basis of a complaint lodged by the victim\u2019s wife, K. Esakkiammal (23), would amount to conducting two separate probes with respect to the same incident.\n\nPursuant to the direction issued by the Sessions Court, the CB-CID had booked as many as 12 accused, including the petitioners, Assistant Commissioner of Police G.S. Madhavan and Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajaram, under Section 302 (murder) and various other provisions of the Indian Penal Code.",
