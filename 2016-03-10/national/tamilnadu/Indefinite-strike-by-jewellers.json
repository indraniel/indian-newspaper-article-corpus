Muthuvenkatraman, president of Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers\u2019 Association, at a meeting with goldsmith associations here on Wednesday, it was decided that the goldsmiths would keep the units open as most of them worked out of their residence.\n\nThey would complete the pending jobs and would not take up fresh orders. They also pointed out that since there was slowdown in demand for gold jewellery, several goldsmiths had shifted to other jobs and sought protection of work.",
