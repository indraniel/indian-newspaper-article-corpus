    "text": "DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Wednesday said if the State government was really interested in getting justice in the alleged suicide of agriculture engineer S. Muthukumarasamy, it should prefer an appeal against the order of the Madras High Court quashing the case against former Agricultural Minister Agri S.S. Krishnamoorthy .\n\nIn a statement here, Mr. Karunanidhi urged the government to hand over the investigation of the case to the CBI. \u201cThe Judge has remarked that there was no reliable evidence against the former Minister and his observation has proved who is responsible for the failure,\u201d Mr. Karunanidhi said.\n\nRecalling his demand that the case should be transferred to the CBI as the CB-CID, functioning under the control of the State government, could not probe the allegations properly, Mr. Karunanidhi said the former Minister was never subjected to inquiry in police custody. \u201cHis house was also not raided,\u201d the DMK chief said.\n\nPMK leader S. Ramadoss said the acquittal of Mr. Krishnamoorthy had shattered people\u2019s faith in the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThe CB-CID should have proved in the court that the former Minister was responsible for the death of an honest official. But, from the very beginning, the investigating agency failed to conduct the case in a proper manner,\u201d Dr. Ramadoss said and called upon the government to file an appeal against the order.",
