Ramakrishnan, State secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist), in the Nilgiris on Wednesday.\n\nAddressing reporters in Gudalur, he said that the State government should have taken more interest in the issue. The ruling AIADMK should also have used its strength in the Lok Sabha to prevail upon the Central government to direct GAIL to change the proposed alignment of the pipeline from farmers\u2019 fields to highways.\n\nCommenting on the release of former Minister \u2018Agri\u2019 S.S. Krishnamoorthy in the case involving the alleged suicide of officer Muthukumaraswamy, Mr. Ramakrishnan alleged that the State government had not carried out a proper probe and that was the reason that political parties demanded a CBI probe.\n\nThe AIADMK leader faced the disproportionate assets case and the DMK leadership was tainted in the 2G scam, he said and added that both the parties were guilty in granite scam.\n\nA statement Mr. Ramakrishanan released spoke about the People\u2019s Welfare Front taking steps to improve the livelihood of small tea growers; provide loan to farmers; withdraw GO 1169 to pave way to issue title deeds; provide basic amenities in pockets dominated by tribal people; throw open the Ooty race course for the public.",
