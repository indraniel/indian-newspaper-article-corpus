    "text": "The Service Doctors and Postgraduates Association, who are on a State-wide signature campaign seeking various benefits from the State Government, said that more than 5,000 doctors working in government hospitals and primary health centres in 20 districts have been protesting for more than a year seeking fulfilment of their demands.\n\nState president of the association N. Lakshmi Narasimhan said that more than 200 doctors working in Coimbatore Medical College and its hospital have taken part in the signature campaign. He said there are around 15,000 doctors working in State-run hospitals and health care institutions.\n\nSeeking salary on par with the doctors working in Central Government-run hospitals, they sought abolition of the contributory pension scheme, and reinstatement of the old pension scheme. \u201cDespite putting in more efforts we are paid less compared to the doctors working in Central Government-run hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir other important demand was seeking two years child care leave for women doctors. They also sought creating corpus fund for the kin of deceased government doctors. They said that the government was deducting Rs. 30 a month from their salary to provide Rs. 3 lakh as assistance to the family members of deceased government doctors. \u201cLet the government deduct Rs. 300 a month and give compensation accordingly,\u201d the state general secretary of the association P. Saminathan said.\n\nThe State-wide campaign that began in Chennai on February 19 will conclude by the end of this month. The association will submit their demands to the Health Secretary and to the newly formed State Government.",
