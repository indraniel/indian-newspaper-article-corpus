Pethaperumal brought to the notice of CEC that the Assembly has been convened even after announcement of the poll dates.\n\nMr. Pethaperumal said, \u201cIf the Chief Minister makes any announcement or declaration, it will be against the rules and procedure laid down by the Election Commission.\u201d\n\nOpposition parties are likely to mount scathing attacks on the ruling party if the Assembly lasts for more than a day. The assembly session may be very brief on Thursday.\n\nPrevious session\n\nThe previous session of the Assembly too was a brief one and concluded within a few minutes of meeting. There was no discussion.",
