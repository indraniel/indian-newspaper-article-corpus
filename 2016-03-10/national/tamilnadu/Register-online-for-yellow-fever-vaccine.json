    "text": "The King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research has launched online registrations for the yellow fever vaccine. Those who want to get the vaccine can now book an appointment and pay online. Appointments will be available on Tuesdays and Fridays, said director of the institute P. Gunasekaran.\n\n\u201cThe initiative was launched two months ago but became functional last Friday. Since we cater to whole of the south, people found it difficult as they had to come in early in the morning, stay a long time and then leave for other places. Also, we were handling a lot of money \u2014 sometimes around Rs. 1 lakh every week, with about 200 or so people coming in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe online process, said Dr. Gunasekaram will make it easier for a lot of people to register and pay before coming in. \u201cWe only used to offer the vaccines on Fridays, but now are doing it twice a week. We hope to offer it five days a week and we are working out the deployment of a staff nurse for this,\u201d he said.\n\nTen people registered online on Wednesday.",
