A case of death under suspicious circumstances was booked and the body was sent to District Government Headquarters Hospital.\n\nWhen the Sriperumpudur police made arrangements for the post-mortem examination on Tuesday, the move was thwarted by some groups. As a result, the inquest was rescheduled for Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a large number of people gathered on the hospital premises and raised slogans demanding justice. They alleged that Ajithkumar had been driven to the extreme step by the college management as it had ill-treated him on the basis of his performance in semester examinations.\n\nThey demanded a huge sum of money as compensation for the deceased student\u2019s family. In view of the demonstration, the student\u2019s family could not receive Ajithkumar\u2019s body for cremation till evening, the police added. Preliminary inquiry states that Ajithkumar, son of Gnanamani, Allur village, Chidambaram taluk, Cuddalore district, was pursuing Civil Engineering at the college. He had not cleared some of the papers in the two semester examinations held in the first year and also failed to clear some papers in the third-semester examination in November 2015, the police added.",
