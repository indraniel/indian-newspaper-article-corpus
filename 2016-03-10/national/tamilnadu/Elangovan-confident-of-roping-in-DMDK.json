    "text": "The Congress subscribes to DMK leader M. Karunanidhi\u2019s contention that the DMDK will be roped into their alliance, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president EVKS Elangovan said on Wednesday.\n\nThe priority is to make the DMDK a part of the opposition alliance to defeat the AIADMK government, he told mediapersons here. But Mr. Elangovan refused to say if he had met DMDK leader on behalf of the DMK.\n\nFor both DMK and Congress, the alliance amounted to upholding self-respect. Hence, the number of seats or choice of constituencies the Congress would get was not an issue, Mr. Elangovan said.\n\nThe TNCC leader said the Election Commission ought to tighten its noose on industrialists assigned in every district by ruling AIADMK for distribution of cash to voters rather than harassing small traders.\n\nHe said the People\u2019s Welfare Front would disintegrate and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and CPI (M) would walk out of the alliance.\n\nThe exit of erstwhile TMC leaders from the Congress had strengthened the latter at the grassroots level, Mr. Elangovan claimed.\n\nHe made it clear that seats would be given only to those who had applied and those who stood a chance to win.\n\nFactions were irrelevant, Mr. Elangovan said when asked if there would a quota for supporters of former Union Minister P. Chidambaram.\n\nThe poll manifesto work was in progress. It will be released after ratification by the All India Congress Committee, Mr. Elangovan said.",
