Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nA team of experts from National College, Tiruchi, visited a couple of villages on Wednesday to investigate the loud blast that damaged the walls of two houses in Mettupatti Thathanur near Ayothiyapattanam two days ago.\n\nThe team led by K. Anbarasu, Principal, National College, who is also a geologist, inspected the damaged houses in Mettupatti Thathanur and enquired with the local people.\n\nThe team members also visited the nearby Minnampalli village and inspected the rocky areas to ascertain the cause of the unusual deafening noise.\n\nThe cracks suffered in the houses proved that the loud noise had generated shock waves.\n\nDr. Anbarasu said that the people of Muttaikadai area in Minnampillai have felt severe vibration. This leads to the suspicion that this could have been the spot of generation of vibration.\n\nThe government should initiate a detailed study and order an investigation by a national research institute immediately, Dr. Anbarasu said.",
