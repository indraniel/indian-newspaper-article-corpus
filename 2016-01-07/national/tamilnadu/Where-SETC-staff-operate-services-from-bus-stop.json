Karunakaran\n\nThe move to operate long-distance buses from Indira Nagar 2nd Avenue in Adyar to various destinations may be a boon to the public. However, the staff, who are the lynchpin of these operations, are working under poor conditions.\n\nThe State Express Transport Corporation operates several services to destinations such as Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, Kumbakonam, Kancheepuram, Tiruchi and Salem, some of which originate from this spot.\n\nThough a bunker is available for the time keeper, the facility lacks any electricity or lighting.\n\nDue to this, the time keeper functions from a bus stand of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation.\n\nAnd there is no toilet. Considering the number of conductors and drivers who go on long trips, a rest room is very much needed.\n\nA time keeper pointed out that lack of lighting, cramped work spaces and absence of toilets were making things very difficult for the staff.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhether it rains or shines, we work under the shade of the bus stand.\u201d",
