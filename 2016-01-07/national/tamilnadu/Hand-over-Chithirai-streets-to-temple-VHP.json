    "text": "The Madurai district unit of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has appealed to the Madurai Corporation to hand over the Chithirai streets to the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple to bolster security around the temple.\n\nIn a statement condemning the explosion of a crude bomb near the temple on Tuesday night, the president of the district unit, Chinmaya R. Somasundaram, pointed out that the VHP had been highlighting the threat posed to security of the temple by buildings constructed beyond permissible height around it.\n\nYatri nivas\n\nThe civic body, it said, should hand over the Chithirai streets to the temple administration and remove buildings constructed in violation of rules. It should also hand over the parking lot and the vacant site on which the Kunnathur Chatram stood to the temple. These two sites, it said, could be used for the construction of a yatri nivas.",
