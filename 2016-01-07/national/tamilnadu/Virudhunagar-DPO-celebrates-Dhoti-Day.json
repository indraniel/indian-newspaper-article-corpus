    "text": "For a section of policemen and officials and male ministerial staff at the District Police Office, Wednesday was a break from their mundane khakhi uniform or the full pants of different hue. Everyone had come in white dhoti to office.\n\nWhen Superintendent of Police P. Aravindhan suggested to celebrate \u2018Dhoti Day\u2019, they readily accepted the suggestion.\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday, I made the suggestion. And almost all the ministerial staff and other police officials on duty today at the DPO turned up in dhoti,\u201d Mr. Aravidhan said.\n\nIt was a good feeling for everyone to be part of the State government\u2019s celebration of the Dhoti Day.\n\n\u201cAs dhoti is the Tamil\u2019s own traditional attire, many took pride in celebrating it,\u201d Mr. Aravidhan added.\n\nThe SP, who himself turned up in dhoti, said that he had appealed to his staff to buy dhoti at a Co-optex showroom, if at all someone had to buy one for the occasion.",
