It is notable that many of these roads were re-laid only recently, spending huge sums of money, and they are still covered by the liability provision.\n\nHowever, Corporation officials have decided not to invoke the provision and free these contractors of liability.\n\n\u201cAt least 25 bus routes have been damaged within the liability period,\u201d said a senior official of Chennai Corporation.\n\nMore than 180 bus routes were relaid for the global investors meet a few months ago. Thousands of interior roads were also relaid in 2015.\n\nNot to invoke\n\nliability clause\n\nThe official said the civic body would not invoke liability provisions against contractors, on account of the floods.\n\nHowever, the Chennai Corporation is yet to release the data relating to quality of the newly relaid roads that had been damaged in the floods.\n\nFormer IAS Officer M. G. Devasahayam said the contractors who had carried out a shoddy work escaped due to the floods.",
