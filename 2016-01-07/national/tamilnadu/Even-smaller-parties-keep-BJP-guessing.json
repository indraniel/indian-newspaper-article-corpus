    "text": "After the bigger allies \u2014 DMDK and PMK \u2014 refused to provide any concrete assurance on the electoral alliance for the Assembly polls in the recent meetings, the BJP has been forced to play the guessing game with its smaller partners as well.\n\nIn the last two weeks, BJP leaders, divided into teams, have gone around meeting smaller allies such as the India Jananayaga Katchi (IJK) and New Justice Party (NJP), hoping to consolidate the NDA by the time the bigger parties make their decisions. But it has clearly turned out to be a sour experience, sources say.\n\nKongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KNMDK) general secretary E.R. Eswaran, after a meeting with senior leaders L. Ganesan, H. Raja and Vanathi Srinivasan on Wednesday, told The Hindu that he had not given any promise to the BJP.\n\n\u201cThe general council meeting of our party is scheduled on January 8. The BJP\u2019s invite will be placed before the council and a decision would be made,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if the KNMDK was still a constituent of the NDA, Mr. Eswaran wondered if it existed at all.\n\n\u201cAfter 2014 Lok Sabha polls, there has not been a single coordination meeting of the NDA. Have you seen the partners coming together and issuing a common statement on any issue? When this is the case, what is the use of talking about it?\u201d he asked. Mr. Eswaran contested the Pollachi constituency as part of the NDA in 2014 LS polls and secured the second place ahead of the DMK candidate.\n\nThe response from all the three smaller groups has been similar though they were hopeful of all the three parties continuing in the alliance, BJP sources said.",
