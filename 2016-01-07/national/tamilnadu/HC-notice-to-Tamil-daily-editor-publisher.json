Sathia Chandran, alleged that the daily published an editorial on July 13, 2013 in which it faulted the Madras High Court for ordering a second autopsy following doubts over the circumstances under which Dalit youth Ilavarasan was found dead near a railway track in Dharmapuri soon after his wife Divya separated from him.\n\nAlleging that the editorial had cast aspersions on the judiciary, he had on July 15, 2013 appealed to the court seeking to punish the editor and publisher for committing contempt of court.\n\nThe court had advised the petitioner to seek the permission of the Advocate General to move the contempt proceeding as the complaint is of criminal nature.\n\nOn Wednesday, the petitioner moved the contempt proceedings with the approval of the Advocate General before the Division Bench of Justice R. Sudhakar and Justice P.N. Prakash.\n\nThe daily\u2019s editorial faulted High Court for ordering second autopsy on Ilavarasan",
