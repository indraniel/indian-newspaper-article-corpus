Many youngsters have expressed their solidarity to the Front through their posts on Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp.\n\nMr. Vaiko said that there were sustained campaigns from some forces to derail the PWF.\n\n\u201cAll our allies are confident of facing the challenge,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe PWF\u2019s proposed conference on January 26 in Madurai would be a turning point and set the stage for the 2016 elections, Mr. Vaiko said.",
