After depending so much on technology, it is astonishing to know people are relying on natural products to make saris. This knowledge should be definitely shared to promote the importance of natural ingredients,\u201d said Ms. Carrie, who works to share the traditional crafts of India through exhibitions and performances at her U.S. centre. She appreciated the efforts of women weavers who wanted to showcase to the world that using natural fibres was viable, she said. They had plans to display Anakaputhur weavers\u2019 works in a gallery at their centre.\n\nAnakaputhur Weavers Association president C. Sekar said about 25 natural ingredients were used to weave the cloth.",
