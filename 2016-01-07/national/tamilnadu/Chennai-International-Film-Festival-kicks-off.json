We thought that the festival would have to be cancelled. But with the support of the government and film buffs, we have been able to conduct the festival. This year too we have a great line up of movies including 20 Oscar nominated films,\u201d said E. Thangaraj, director of Chennai International Film Festival.\n\nThe inauguration had the participation of Nadigar Sangam office bearers including actor Karthi and other CIFF regulars including Suhasini Maniratnam who has been actively involved in the film festival over the last few years.\n\nThe chief guests included Tanu Rai, deputy director, Indian Panorma and Helmut Schippert, director of Goethe Institut.\n\nThe closing ceremony promises to be grander as organisers claim actor Rajinikanth has agreed to attend, provided his busy schedule allows it.\n\nThe first day had a lot for film buffs in the city. \u201cThere were three films which were well received. First one was the Turkish film, Eksik , which is about a victim of a certain political event in the country. The next one was Death of Fish , an Iranian film about the strange will of a woman. The film for the evening was an award-winning German film, Victoria ,\u201d said E. Thangaraj, director of Chennai International Film Festival.\n\nVictoria was screened as the first big film to open this year\u2019s festival.\n\nHelmut Schippert, director of Goethe Institut, introduced the movie to the packed cinema hall. Around 183 films from over 50 movies will be screened.",
