Thirumavalavan on Wednesday said that his party was a founding member of People's Welfare Front (PWF) and there was no question of the party joining the AIADMK or the DMK led alliance for the Assembly elections.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of the party\u2019s executive committee meeting, he asserted that none could break the PWF. The front had emerged as a real alternative to both the AIADMK and the DMK.\n\nOn whether he had met any emissary of DMK, Mr. Thirumavalavan said former Bishop Ezra Sargunam met him recently to extend new year greetings. It was not a secret meeting. He also enquired about the prospects of the PWF in the elections, Mr.Thirumavalavan said.\n\nOn more parties joining the PWF, he said the front had extended invitation to the DMDK and the TMC and hoped they would respond positively.\n\nNo one can\n\nbreak the People's Welfare Front, says Thol Thirumavalavan",
