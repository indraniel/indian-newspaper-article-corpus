Now, new software is on the run to track and bring to book repeat offences beyond the tokenism of fine.\n\nThe Motor Petty Cases Monitoring System \u2013 a software commissioned into operation by the district police here would consolidate petty cases registered in each station into a ready-to-track database. Motor vehicle petty cases registered in each police station for overloading, over-speeding, drunk-driving, helmet-less riding etc will be uploaded in the MPCMS server. The minute a case is registered and the data is uploaded onto the server, the software would throw up the number of cases registered against the vehicle number. \u201cFor the violators, it is easy to pay up a fine of Rs. 100, but there is no fear of being tracked down to the previous offence.\u201d The difficulty is with the lack of an authentic scientific system to track repeat motor-vehicle offences. \u201cThe quick tracking of offences has been a problem, which will be addressed now by this database software.\u201d In addition, the police are also mulling over an Android app with the IP address of the server that the police can download to readily access the database.",
