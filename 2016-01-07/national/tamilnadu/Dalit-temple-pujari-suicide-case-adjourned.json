Poornima on Wednesday adjourned the temple pujari suicide case till January 19 on Wednesday as the petitioner\u2019s lawyer informed the court that the petitioner had filed an affidavit in the High Court seeking an advocate instead of public prosecutor to argue the case.\n\nThe court was expected to examine witnesses in the morning. Ten out of the 19 witnesses appeared before the court. O. Raja, brother of Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam, and other accused too appeared before the court. But the petitioner, Subburaj, father of the deceased, did not appear.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s advocate told the court that the petitioner feared that the public prosecutor appointed by the government would support only All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries.
