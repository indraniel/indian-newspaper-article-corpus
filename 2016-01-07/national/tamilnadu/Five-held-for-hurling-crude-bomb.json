Mathirajan (38) of Kamarajapuram, J. Gunasekarapandian (29) of Villapuram, V. Arunkumar (30) of Pankajam Colony, S. Silambarasan (27) of South Gate and R. Chidambaram (27) of Parasurampatti.\n\nA police statement said that Madurai Corporation removed encroachments in East Chithirai Street on January 2. This forced the roadside vendors who were evicted to move to North Chithirai Street to put up their shops. This led to income loss for those who had already set their shops in North Chithirai Street.\n\nThe police said that the accused who already had their shops there conspired to chase the new vendors away and hurled the bomb to put the blame on those who shifted their base, the police said.\n\nAround 7 p.m., bottle filled with kerosene was lit and thrown on the wall of a house in Central Market Lane, and it exploded.\n\nHowever, no one was injured in the incident.\n\nThe accused were remanded, the statement said.",
