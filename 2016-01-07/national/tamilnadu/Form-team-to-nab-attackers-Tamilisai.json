Venkatachalapathy\n\nCondemning the delay in nabbing the attackers of the party\u2019s functionary Sivaprakasam, Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s State president Tamilisai Soundararajan demanded constituting a special police team to trace the culprits immediately.\n\n\u201cEven five days after the attack, the police have not made any arrests in the case or picked up any suspects. There is a general feeling among party persons that the police officers are functioning in a biased manner. Hence, a special team should be formed to trace the culprits,\u201d she said. She was leading the party\u2019s protest against the attack on Wednesday.\n\nOn January 1, Sivaprakasam (60), BJP\u2019s State council member and State vice president of Endowment Cell was attacked by unidentified men when he had stepped out of a temple in Vaniyambadi town at nearly 7 a.m. The men had assaulted Sivaprakasam using iron rods, leaving him with head injuries.\n\nMs. Soundararajan questioned the reason behind alleged police inaction.\n\n\u201cSuch attacks are occurring again in Ambur and Vellore. These places are not only turning unsafe for the BJP but also for the police personnel there,\u201d she said in reference to the Ambur riot last year that left several police men injured.\n\nReferring to the crude bomb explosion near Meenakshi Temple, Madurai, she asked if there were \u201cterrorist activities\u201d in the State.\n\nWhen asked if the ban on jallikattu will be lifted, she said, \u201cBJP has been taking genuine and consistent efforts for the conduct of jallikattu this season.\u201d\n\nShe said the Congress government could have brought a permanent solution to facilitate conduct of jallikattu if they had taken appropriate measures.",
