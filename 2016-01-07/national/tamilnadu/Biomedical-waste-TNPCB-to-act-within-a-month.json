    "text": "National Green Tribunal on Wednesday directed the TNPCB to scrutinise the applications of 208 government hospitals and 27 medical college hospitals within a month for giving its consent after checking whether the biomedical waste disposal units are functioning as per the norms.\n\nThe Bench comprising Justice P. Jyothimani and expert member R. Nagendran directed the TNPCB to consider the applications from all the government hospitals and hospitals attached to medical colleges across the State within a month and grant consent on merits. As for the private hospitals which do not have consent from the TNPCB, Indian Medical Association (IMA) impleaded itself in the case claiming that over 1,000 hospitals in the State were its members. As the Bench was not satisfied with the details provided by the TNPCB on the list of private hospitals not having consent, it sought a fresh report.\n\nPetitioner Jawaharlal Shanmugam had alleged there was lack of liquid biomedical waste treatment facilities in hospitals and sought a direction for corrective action from the TNPCB. The bench later posted the case for January 12.",
