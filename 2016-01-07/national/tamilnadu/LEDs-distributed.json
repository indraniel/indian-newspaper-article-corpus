The distribution of LED lamps was launched by Shubhranshu, Divisional Railway Manager, in the presence of R. S. Sinha, Additional Divisional Railway Manager, S. Rangarajan, Senior Divisional Electrical Engineer-General, and other branch officers and staff.\n\nOn an average a common incandescent lamp of 40 watt capacity lit for 12 hours would consume 14 units of electricity per month, whereas with the usage of LED bulb it would come down to 2.5 units. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Shubhranshu commended the initiative of the Electrical General branch of Salem Division and said that every unit of electricity saved is to be deemed as that much energy produced.",
