Krishnasamy, president of Puthiya Tamilagam and Ottapidaram MLA, said damage caused by the recent heavy rains and subsequent flood in November in Tuticorin had not been assessed promptly to distribute compensation for victims.\n\nThere were still localities where residents had been facing problems caused by waterlogging.\n\nAfter submitting a report on flood damages to the Central team, which arrived here on Wednesday to inspect the damage, Dr. Krishnasamy told the media that flood-hit areas of Ottapidaram taluk, localities under Tuticorin Corporation and Srivaikuntam taluk, were neglected by the State government and nobody inspected to help the victims.\n\nEven the flood victims were not informed of the team\u2019s inspection, he said. On an average, expenditure of Rs.17,000 was incurred by a farmer on an acre.",
