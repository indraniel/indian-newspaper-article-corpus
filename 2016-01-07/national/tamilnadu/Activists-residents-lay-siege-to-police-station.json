Ayyappan, of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam said the illegal sale of ganja was brazenly done in several areas with the knowledge of police and innocent adolescent students and youth are forced into crime.\n\nEven as the sale of lottery was banned in several states including Tamil Nadu, the lottery business has been thriving.\n\nThe police officers have been ineffective and failed to take any action against the crimes.\n\nPolice officials rebutted these allegations and claimed that no complaint had been lodged in this regard.\n\nThey said the local police are not empowered to handle the cases relating to illegal sale and possession of ganja and the illegal lottery sale.",
