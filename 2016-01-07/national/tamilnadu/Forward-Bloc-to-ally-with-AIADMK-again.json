    "text": "The All India Forward Bloc will continue to align with the AIADMK for the ensuing Assembly elections, said its general secretary, Debabrata Biswas. The party had contested the 2011 Assembly polls in the AIADMK-led alliance.\n\nAddressing journalists here on Wednesday, Mr. Biswas gave a clean chit to the Jayalalithaa administration. \u201cIt has been a good administration . The government has handled the unprecedented flood situation very effectively,\u201d he said.\n\nStating that the law and order in West Bengal had worsened under the Mamata Banjeree Government, he said people feared to come out late in the night there. \u201cWith bitter experience in West Bengal, I would say Tamil Nadu is a heaven,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about the two major Left parties in the State which opposed the AIADMK and were part of the People\u2019s Welfare Front, Mr. Biswas said that the AIFB cannot be blamed for it. \u201cWe wanted the CPI and the CPI (M) to take the responsibility for AIFB too in forging alliance with the AIADMK. But, both the parties took unilateral decision without taking AIFB into confidence,\u201d he said.",
