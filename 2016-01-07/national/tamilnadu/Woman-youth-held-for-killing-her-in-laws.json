The police said that the duo, after killing the aged couple, waited for Durga\u2019s husband Manikantan (34), a lab technician. They attacked him after he discovered his parents\u2019 bodies, but he managed to escape and alert the police.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (South East), M.B. Boralingaiah, said that Durga had met Anji, her relative and fell in love with him.
