Ashok\n\nOn the second day of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam\u2019s 64th anniversary celebrations on Tuesday, Gayathri Venkatraghavan propitiated the lotus feet of the Elephant God in a viruttam and then entreated rasikas in the verse of Sivan to worship \u201cShivalokanathanai\u201d in Mayamalava Gowlai, which she elaborated with Kalpana swarams. \u201cGuha Saravanabhava\u201d in Simmendra Madyamam followed with the same energy.\n\nA slokam on Srimad Sundaranayaki was given to melody and devotion, as was \u201cAkilandeswari\u201d in Dwijavanthi by Dikshithar.\n\nThe concentration and creativity with which she presented Madhyamavathi for Thyagaraja\u2019s \u201cRamakatha\u201d won her a big round of applause.\n\nThe response of the violinist, R.K. Sriramkumar, to her singing was noteworthy. Neyveli R. Narayanan on the mrudangam and Krishnan on the ghatam performed with speed and variety during the thani, making the main song a great success.\n\nA pallavi penned by the violinist, \u201cSwara sangeetha laya anandha,\u201d in dedication to M.S. Subbulakshmi took centre stage following raga alapana and the singer presented several sangathis of the same in Purvikalyani.\n\nThe final pieces included \u201cSrinivasa Thiruvengadamudayan,\u201d \u201cNenjukku needhiyum\u201d and \u201cEvvul kindandhane\u201d on the deity at Thiruvallur.\n\nThe visual enhancement of the stage with pictures of the three musical greats was appealing. Given the uplifting quality of Gayathri\u2019s music, the celebration is bound to draw a younger crowd to listen to Carnatic music in the days to come.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
