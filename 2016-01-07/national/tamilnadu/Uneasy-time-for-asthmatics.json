They are intermittent, and generally become worse in winter because of a rise in infections,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Kumar has seen around a 20 per cent rise in the number of cases, but most of these are patients who have stopped their medications.\n\n\u201cThose who have continued with their medications are more comfortable this season. With asthma, it is important to remember that an absence of symptoms is not an absence of disease,\u201d he says. The disease is still under-diagnosed, said Dr. Kumar.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, if asthma is not treated, the airflow becomes lower and lower, leading to very little air going in and out, which will severely compromise day-to-day life,\u201d he says, adding that approximately 3 to 7 per cent of the people in Chennai may have asthma.\n\nR.P. Ilangho, senior consultant-respiratory physician, Apollo Hospitals, says the number of cases he sees goes up by between 30 and 50 per cent in the winter. \u201cBut more research is needed on this, since there are no current statistics on asthma\u2019s rise in winter,\u201d he said.\n\nPeak flow meters, inhalers and spacer devices are key to improving the quality of life for those with asthma, he says.\n\n\u201cPeak flow meters are small devices that check how good your airways are \u2014 they are essential to people with asthma just as blood pressure (BP) monitors are to those with BP problems,\u201d he said. Spacer devices are plastic chambers attached to inhalers that help the inhalant to be taken in properly and prevent side effects \u2014 very useful in children.\n\nResidents tend to close their windows because of the cold, and this could lead to mould and dampness \u2014 a trigger factor for asthma.\n\n\u201cCross-ventilation is very important,\u201d said Somu Sivabalan, paediatric pulmonologist at Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital.\n\n\u201cThis season, people with asthma must try and dilute the load of irritants by making sure their immediate environment is clean and tidy, practising hand hygiene and eating healthy,\u201d he said.\n\nStay healthy this winter\n\nEnsure your immediate environment has good cross ventilation\n\nKeep your home clean and tidy\n\nWash your hands frequently and eat healthy to stave off infections\n\nDo not stop your medications even if you have no symptoms without consulting a doctor\n\nIf you think you have asthma, see a doctor and get treated early",
