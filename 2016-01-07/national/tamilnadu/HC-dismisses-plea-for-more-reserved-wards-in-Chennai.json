    "text": "The Madras High Court has dismissed a plea seeking a direction to the State government to increase the number of wards in the Corporation of Chennai allotted to the candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to the increase in the total number of wards after the last delimitation exercise.\n\nA public interest litigation petition said that prior to 2011, the Chennai Corporation had 155 wards of which 26 were reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Thereafter, through a Government Order dated July 19, 2011 after the delimitation process, the number of wards of Chennai Corporation was increased from 155 to 200. However, the number of reserved wards remained 26. The petitioner pleaded for proportionately increasing the number of reserved wards in view of the increase in total wards.\n\nThe High Court had in February last year disposed of a similar petition with a direction to the authorities concerned to dispose of the petitioner\u2019s representation.\n\nSince the authorities did not act favourably, the petitioner moved the present PIL. In its counter-affidavit, the State Government submitted that prior to delimitation in 2011, only 21 wards were reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Post-delimitation, this was increased to 26 and hence the petitioner\u2019s contentions were factually wrong.\n\nRecording the submission, the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana dismissed the PIL.",
