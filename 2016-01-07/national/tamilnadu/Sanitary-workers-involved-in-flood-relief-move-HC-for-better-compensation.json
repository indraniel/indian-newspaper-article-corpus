As part of the flood relief, the State government mobilised sanitary workers from across the State to clean the city.\n\n\u201cThough there was no official order, the government promised that an additional sum of Rs. 2,000 will be provided for permanent workers and Rs. 300 for daily workers who were involved in the cleaning work,\u201d the petitioner said.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that the workers were made to stay in places with inadequate facilities.\n\n\u201cThey had to work 12 hours per day.
