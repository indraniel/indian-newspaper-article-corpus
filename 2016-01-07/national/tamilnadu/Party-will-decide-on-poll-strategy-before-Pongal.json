    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party has fixed Pongal as its deadline for finalising its strategy for the forthcoming Assembly elections, H. Raja, national secretary of the party, told reporters here on Wednesday.\n\nHe was here to attend a function organised at the Sankara Mutt here.\n\nOn whether the strategy adopted by the BJP in Kerala, which helped to increase its vote share, would be adopted in Tamil Nadu too, Mr. Raja said the party was able to increase its vote share in Kerala by joining hands with \u201cSangh Parivar\u201d outfits in the local body elections. But, there are hundreds of political parties in Tamil Nadu and politics here is guided by alliances. \u201cWe have decided to finalise our election strategy before Pongal,\u201d he said.\n\nTo a question on the fate of jallikattu, Mr. Raja said bringing in ordinance, as indicated by former Chief Justice of India Markandeya Katju, or issuing an Executive Order for the removal of bull from the list of performing animals would be sufficient to clear the hurdle.\n\nMr. Raja said he was confident that the Centre would adopt one of these options within two or three days.",
