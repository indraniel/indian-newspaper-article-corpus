Perarivalan - one of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case - submitted a petition to the Chief Minister\u2019s cell on Wednesday seeking her son\u2019s release at least for Pongal this year.\n\nTalking to reporters after submitting the petition, Ms. Arputham Ammal recalled her son\u2019s petition to the Governor on December 30 requesting to facilitate his release under Article 161 of the Constitution and hoped that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa would facilitate his release on January 17, the birth anniversary of AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Minister\u2019s reassurance that my son would soon be released and come to me is still fresh in my memory and with that hope, I am up on my feet. The Law Department and the Justice Department have betrayed me. I am hoping that the Chief Minister would help in the release of my son,\u201d she said.\n\n25 years behind bars\n\nPerarivalan has been in prison for more than 25 years since the inquiry began in the case.\n\n\u201cIf he is not released, this will be the 25th Pongal he will not be spending with us. I am 69, my husband is 74 years old and diabetic. We hope to see our son live with us at least during our last years,\u201d said Arputham Ammal, as tears coursed down her cheeks.\n\nA day after the death sentence of the convicts was commuted by the Supreme Court in February 2014, the State government adopted a resolution in the Assembly that the convicts be released. However, the Centre had moved the apex court and obtained a stay.\n\nSubmits petition to Chief Minister\u2019s cell seeking his release",
