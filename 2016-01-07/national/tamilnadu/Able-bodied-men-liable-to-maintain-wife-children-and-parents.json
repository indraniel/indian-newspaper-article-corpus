Venugopal made the observation while dismissing a criminal revision case filed by a person challenging an order passed by Dindigul Chief Judicial Magistrate in 2014 directing him to pay Rs. 3,000 every month to his estranged wife.\n\nThe judge said that the petitioner\u2019s wife had actually failed to prove through sufficient and acceptable documentary and oral evidence that he owned valuable immovable properties besides earning Rs. 10,000 a month by lending money.\n\n\u201cEven in the absence of necessary proof, as stated already, after marriage, it is the duty of the husband to provide shelter and maintenance to the wife. Since he had failed to do so\u2026 the decision of the lower court cannot be found fault with,\u201d he added.\n\nThough Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stated that courts could direct only \u201ca person having sufficient means\u201d to pay maintenance, Mr. Justice Venugopal said, the term \u2018sufficient means\u2019 would also include the capacity of an individual to earn money.\n\nAdultery charge\n\nThough the petitioner had accused his wife of adultery and claimed that he was not liable to pay maintenance to her since she was living with another man, the judge said that the serious accusation could not be believed by a court of law without reliable proof.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, direct proof of adultery is not imperative. The accepted rule, in this regard, is that circumstantial evidence is all that can normally be expected in proof of the allegation or charge\u2026 In the present case, the petitioner had failed to establish the same,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u2018It is the duty of the husband to provide shelter and maintenance to the wife\u2019",
