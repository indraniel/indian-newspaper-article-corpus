    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 on an advocate for \u201cmisleading the court\u201d and wasting its precious time by filing a frivolous case and attempting to obtain favourable orders through suppression of facts.\n\nJustice S. Vaidyanathan directed the lawyer from Tiruchi to pay the cost to Cheer, a non-governmental organisation based in Chennai, which in turn was asked to utilise the money for relief and rehabilitation of people affected during the recent floods in the State capital.\n\nNot appreciating the way in which the lawyer, P. Ramaiah, had filed a writ petition on behalf of his client Rt.Rev.H.A. Martin in a dispute related to management of Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church, the judge said that a lawyer should not act as a servant of his/her client.\n\n\u201cA lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice\u2026 They (lawyers) should analyse the probable outcome of cases by using their knowledge of legal matters and offer advice about ends.\n\n\u201cIn the case on hand, the petitioner has misled this court and wasted the time of the judiciary as well as the administration\u2026 Even assuming for the sake of argument that he has locus standi to file this petition, he cannot merely act as a spokesperson to Rt.Rev.Dr.H.A.Martin,\u201d the judge said.",
