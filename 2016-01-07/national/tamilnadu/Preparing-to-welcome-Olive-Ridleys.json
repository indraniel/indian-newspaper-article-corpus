Another issue we\u2019ve been facing over the years are the bright lights along the beach, which might result in the baby turtles moving towards the source of illumination on the road. They become vulnerable to animal attacks and accidents,\u201d she said.\n\nA Government Order, she said, had instructed that high mast lights be switched off during the Olive Ridley nesting season.\n\nOver the years, however, the number of volunteers, environmentalists, conversationalists and general public who have taken an interest in the protection of the species, which has been classified as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, has risen with a number of public walks and awareness drives.\n\nThe city in February is also set to host a \u2018Ridley Run\u2019, a marathon to propagate the importance of protecting the species.\n\nHelping volunteers\n\nKarunakaran, a fisherman and supervisor of a hatchery near the broken bridge said that many like him had taken a keen interest in the turtles and were coordinating with volunteers during the nesting time.\n\n\u201cWe try to minimise our visits into the sea in January and February and help volunteers who go on turtle walks in the night with the nests they find. Since these walks end at 3 a.m., we go and scour the beaches after that to see if any nests have been left with eggs and take them into the hatchery,\u201d he said.",
