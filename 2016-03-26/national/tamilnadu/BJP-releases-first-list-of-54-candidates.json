    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday evening released its first list of 54 candidates who would contest the Assembly election.\n\nProminent among the contestants are the party\u2019s national secretary H. Raja and Tamil Nadu unit vice president Vanathi Srinivasan.\n\nThe list was released in New Delhi after a party consultation meeting.\n\nThe BJP, which remained isolated in the Dravidian State between 2006 and 2013 managed to form a third front under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance to face the last Lok Sabha elections. However, the alliance disintegrated shortly after the formation of the Narendra Modi Government.\n\nIn the run-up to this Assembly elections, the BJP desperately wooed its erstwhile allies, the DMDK and the PMK, which had long ago announced its youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss as the chief ministerial candidate. However, its bid to revive the NDA failed as the PMK and DMDK insisted that they would lead the alliance.\n\nIn fact, DMDK leader Vijayakant had refused to meet senior BJP leaders who had flown down from New Delhi. Earlier this week, he decided to lead an alliance of which the four-party People\u2019s Welfare Front is a constituent.\n\nFollowing this, the BJP put up a brave face and announced that it would go it alone.\n\nThe BJP is the second party to announce candidates for the Assembly election.\n\nEarlier, Naam Tamilar Katchi had announced candidates for all the 234 constituencies.\n\nThe list was released in\n\nNew Delhi after a party consultation meeting",
