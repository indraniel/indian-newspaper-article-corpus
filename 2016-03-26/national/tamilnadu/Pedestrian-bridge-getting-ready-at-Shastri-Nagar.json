    "text": "Shastri Nagar residents could heave a sigh of relief as the pedestrian bridge being provided by the railways will solve the problem of proceeding to Chennimalai Road from the locality.\n\nThe railways is half-way through installing the bridge above electrified parallel railway lines. The bridge is vital for safety of pedestrians who would have otherwise faced the predicament of using the new railway bridge, thereby ending up causing disturbance to the vehicular traffic.\n\nIt is a standard pattern for railways to install pedestrian bridges at level-crossings that have been identified for closure in future, sources said.\n\nThe hearing in High Court on a case pertaining to acquisition of an encroached part of railway land, on which the completion of the railway bridge project hinges, will come up next month, it is learnt.\n\nThe Rural Roads Division of the Highways Department could not complete the Rs. 10.10-crore NABARD project by February-March, as per its earlier plan, has not materialised due to the delay in legal clearance. The project initiated during February 2014, was originally envisaged for completion by August-September, 2015.\n\nThe railways had completed in time the construction of the 18-mbridge with five spans. While the bridge has been in place for months now, completion of the approach roads is taking time. On the stretch from the bridge towards Chennimalai road, the Highways Department has constructed retaining wall on one side of the approach road.\n\nThe court clearance is what the Highways has been waiting for to expedite completion of the project.",
