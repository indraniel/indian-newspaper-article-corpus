    "text": "\u201cThe kind of political discourses we have today are mostly about personalities, or sometimes about philosophy. It is very difficult to make them [people] talk about real issues,\u201d P. Sivakami, activist and writer, said here on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at a panel discussion on \u2018Political Discourse and Contemporary Writing,\u2019 organised by the U.S. Consulate General and University of Iowa\u2019s International Writing Program at Madras University, she said the current political discourse conspired a dialogue between the two major identities in the State. \u201cThey [the major parties] keep talking only about themselves; it also appears in the media and so people talk about it. But what we need is for people to talk about issues that affect them. They are so distracted by the freebies offered,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted that, in a way, political discourse and contemporary writing neutralise to an extent.\n\nChristopher Merrill, who directs the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa and is also a member of the National Council on the Humanities and the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, said historians were supposed to bring in perspective [when it cames to contemporary writing and political discourse].\n\nK. Srilata, professor, School of Humanities, IIT, Madras; Azhagarasan, professor at Department of English, University of Madras; author and editor Lincoln Paine and poet Sandra Alcosser were among those who spoke at the event.",
