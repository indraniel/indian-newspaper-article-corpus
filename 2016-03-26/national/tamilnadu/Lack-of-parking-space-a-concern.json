    "text": "According to JLL India, there is a demand in Coimbatore for IT space.\n\nThe problem is connectivity and infrastructure and it is slowly improving. But, issues such as parking space and rentals need to be addressed.\n\nFor instance, a BPO occupying 20,000 sq.ft. will employ about 400 people. It needs two-wheeler and car parking area for the employees. But, this is not available in most buildings.\n\nFurther, the average rental is Rs. 35 per sq.ft, apart from the maintenance cost.\n\nThe SEZ norms are expected to change shortly and so there is a demand for independent IT buildings.\n\nBut these should have enough parking space.",
