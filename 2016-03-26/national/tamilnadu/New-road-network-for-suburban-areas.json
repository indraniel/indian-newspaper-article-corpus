    "text": "Development of suburban neighbourhoods of the city is soon expected to be in alignment with a new road network plan. Institutions led by the School of Architecture and Planning, Anna University, have started studying road network and urban development in 14 settlements that are developing in suburban areas. Officials of government agencies such as Greater Chennai Corporation, Highways, Police and Fire and Rescue Services will offer data and assistance for the study.\n\nThe study would suggest development of new roads to cater to newly-developing areas. \u201cA master plan and detailed development plans are time-consuming. A simple road network plan in select areas along Outer Ring Road and Rajiv Gandhi Salai will be prepared in a shorter period. This plan would be used to prevent problems caused by rapid urbanisation,\u201d said an official. Each of the settlements will have four or five 18-metre-wide roads that would serve as connector roads within the city or suburbs. The network would also include roads with a width of 40 ft., 30 ft. and 24 feet. New development would be permitted only after the land earmarked for the road network is handed over to the civic agency concerned.\n\nAn official said the study would address the issues caused by unapproved layouts.",
