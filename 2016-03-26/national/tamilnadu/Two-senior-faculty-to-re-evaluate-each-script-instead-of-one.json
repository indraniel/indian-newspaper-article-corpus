    "text": "BU took the decision to end board valuation\n\nUndergraduate students applying for re-evaluation of their answer scripts will no longer have to worry about whether their papers are being graded fairly. Bangalore University has taken a decision to amend the examination ordinance where two senior faculty instead of one will re-evaluate each script during the coming examination season.\n\nBriefing presspersons after the syndicate meeting on Thursday, Vice-Chancellor B. Thimme Gowda said that the university had decided to end board valuation and replace it with two re-evaluators and taking the average of the two scores.\n\nBoard valuation will only be conducted by the university if there is a difference of more than 15 per cent (in marks) between the valuation and the revaluation.\n\nDuring the 2013-2014, the university received 48,000 applications for re-evaluation; 10,000 during 2014-15 and only around 5,000 for the 2015-2016 academic year.\n\nDeciding to play it safe, Bangalore University has decided not to award honorary doctorate degrees to anyone during this year\u2019s annual convocation.\n\nProf. Gowda on Thursday said that they took this decision to avoid any controversy. During the last syndicate meeting, there was mounting pressure on the university to award a doctorate to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.\n\nBut the university had received some guidelines that universities had to follow while awarding honorary doctorates.",
