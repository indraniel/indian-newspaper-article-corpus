Local IT companies have also occupied space in the IT parks.\n\nThis has resulted in Tidel Park now reaching almost full occupancy.\n\nHowever, the growth in requirement is normal and there is no spurt in demand for IT space. In fact, there are several independent buildings that offer smaller spaces for IT/ITES companies outside the special economic zones and are looking out for clients, according to an IT entrepreneur here.\n\n\u201cWe are in an interesting transition phase. We still have a long way to go,\u201d says S. Prashanth of Quadra Systems.\n\nAshok Bakthavathsalam, Managing Director of KGiSL, says major companies that took area at Coimbatore Hitech Infrastructure Limited have expanded operations. Awareness is improving on the potential in Coimbatore for IT companies.\n\nThough there are not many large IT companies that have started operations here, mid-sized companies are looking at Coimbatore because of availability of talent and cost advantage compared to the metro cities.\n\nRegarding start-ups, \u201cWe need to wait and see if start-ups will create a wave here. We will know in a year or two. The ecosystem for start-ups needs to be carefully nurtured,\u201d he says.",
