    "text": "Sugarcane growers who had supplied their produce to the NKKPR Sugar Mills at Thalaignayar in Nagapattinam district have urged the State government to release the arrears on payment against supplies which had been pending disposal for long to the detriment of the cane growers.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Chief Secretary and Commissioner of Sugar, Arupathy P. Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers' Associations of Cauvery Delta Districts, has said that the arrears to farmers from the sugar mill was to the tune of Rs. 4.18 crore and that it pertained to the last crushing season. The mill paid Rs. 2,200 per tonne of cane supplies while Rs. 350 per tonne was pending.\n\nWhile crushing has not started yet, sugar cane grown on thousands of acres of land was wallowing in neglect because of the delay in harvest that would cost the growers heavily during harvest.\n\nCommence crushing\n\nAround one lakh tonnes of sugar cane would be in jeopardy if harvest and crushing was not commenced soon, Mr. Kalyanam said in the memorandum.\n\nAlthough sections of mill workers who were demanding release of over time payments due to them were on strike, it was the cane growers who were suffering for no fault of theirs, he underlined requesting that efforts must be taken to commence crushing at least before March end.",
