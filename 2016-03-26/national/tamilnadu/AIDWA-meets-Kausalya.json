State General Secretary P. Sugandhi, along with Abirami, widow of another honour killing victim, met Kausalya at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital.\n\nThe State general secretary said that the accused in the murder case should not be let out on bail because Shankar\u2019s family continued to receive threats and there was every possibility that they might threaten Kausalya too.\n\nMs. Sugandhi sought an early trial in the case and maximum punishment for the guilty and State Government support for Kausalya who had expressed interest to resume studies. She also demanded a compensation of Rs. 50 lakh for Kausalya.- Staff Reporter",
