Official sources indicated that the proposal advocates relaxation of norms in terms of area and population.\n\nFormation of a new block will entitle it for the State Balanced Development Fund, since a local body is categorised as backward on the basis of indicators such as health, education, per capita income, and incidence of poverty and unemployment.\n\nUnder the State Balanced Growth Fund, special allocations are made for arriving at parity in human development index, sources said.\n\nGeographically, it will be ideal to create Kadambur block by fragmenting the existing Gudiyalathur panchayat and adding Koothampalayam, Gundri and Thingalur panchayats, the locals emphasise.",
