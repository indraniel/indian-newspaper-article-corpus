Patriotism, she said, did not mean a few symbols created by the government but the rights of human beings.\n\nS. Vivekanandan, vice-president, All India Federation of University and College Teachers\u2019 Organisations, said that it was natural for the majority to fight against the policies and principles of the government if they were meant for a section of society. Nationalism propagated in India was moving closer to European nationalism, which was race-based. \u201cNow, those who opposed fascism are branded anti-nationals,\u201d he said. Prof. Vivekanandan charged the government with propagating pseudo-nationalism to divert attention from real issues.\n\nR. Murali, former Principal, The Madura College, said the JNU was a model democratic sphere and the government wanted to strangle democratic voice. \u201cOne who uses rationality to define nationalism is considered a terrorist in the current state,\u201d he said.\n\nS. Kumarasamy, secretary, CPI (ML), accused the BJP of trying to equate nation with the Modi government. The seminar called for the repeal of the sedition law, which came into force during the British regime.\n\n\u201cGovernment is using nationalism as a blackmail tool to hide its inefficiency\u201d",
