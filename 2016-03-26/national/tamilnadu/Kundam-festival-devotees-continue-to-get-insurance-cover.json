    "text": "The multitudes of devotees who took part in the Kundam festival of Bannari Amman Temple were sensitised to the insurance cover provided for those sustaining injuries on the temple premises while performing the \u2018fire-walking\u2019 ritual.\n\nThe insurance cover has been provided for the devotees for the third year through a tie-up with United India Insurance, Temple sources said.\n\nEach devotee was insured for a maximum of Rs. 1 lakh depending on intensity of wound. As per the policy, if anything happens to a devotee on the temple premises, he or she will be entitled to claim the amount specified.\n\nLast year, there were a few cases of devotees claiming insurance. One devotee received a maximum of Rs. 40,000. This year, too, two devotees are likely to avail themselves of the utility of the insurance cover. They fell on the hearth while performing the firewalking ritual and sustained injuries on hand and leg.\n\nThough police personnel keep a keen watch on the devotees to pull them out in the event of falling, and a waiting medical team provides first-aid treatment, in extreme cases, scalding of the skin becomes inevitable.\n\nTo become eligible for insurance cover, a devotee has to first go to the nearest Government Hospital and have a record of treatment there along with the doctor's certificate. Thereafter, they could continue treatment in private hospitals, temple sources said.\n\nThe practice of insuring devotees is in vogue in major temples in the State including the Palani Murugan Temple and Samayapuram Mariamman Temple. In Erode district, too, other large temples such as Pariyur Kondathu Kaliamman Temple are following the system.",
