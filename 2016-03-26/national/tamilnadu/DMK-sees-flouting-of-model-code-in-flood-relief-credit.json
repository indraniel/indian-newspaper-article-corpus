Bharathi, the organisation secretary of the DMK, alleged that the party had received reports from various parts of Tamil Nadu that banks were crediting flood relief funds to the account holders, \u201cfavouring the ruling AIADMK\u201d.\n\nIn his complaint, Mr. Bharathi pointed out the case of one G. Vasanthi, residing in Pallavaram in Chennai, in whose account Rs. 5,000 was credited under the head \u2018Flood-Relief-20\u2019.\n\nThis, he said, \u201cclearly shows that the banks are in violation of the Model Code of Conduct, colluding with the ruling AIADMK party people in the area concerned.\u201d\n\n\u2018Give directions to banks\u2019\n\nMr. Bharathi urged the Election Commission to issue a direction to all banks in the State to not credit any amount either as flood relief or any other government scheme till the code is in force.\n\nState CEO Rajesh Lakhoni said the Commission would look into matter, and if found true, take necessary action.\n\nThe Election Commission will hold an all-party meet on Saturday morning and brief the parties about guidelines on the MCC and expenditure by parties.\n\nNo Smoking Zones\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission, for the first time, has declared all polling stations in Tamil Nadu as \u2018No Smoking Zones\u2019. \u201cWhile voters normally don\u2019t smoke, sometimes the booth agents use the premises to smoke. We have invoked the provisions of the Tobacco Control Act and will be enforcing this,\u201d Mr. Lakhoni said.\n\nEC to hold all-party meet today to brief the parties about guidelines on the MCC, expenditure",
