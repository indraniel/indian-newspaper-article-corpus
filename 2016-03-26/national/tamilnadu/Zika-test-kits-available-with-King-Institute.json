The Union Health Ministry will start random testing for the virus in patients who show viral fever-like symptoms by the end of April, a media report has said.\n\nDiagnostic facilities to test for the virus are now available in Tamil Nadu, said Director of Public Health K. Kolandaisamy, with the King Institute of Preventive Medicine having acquired testing kits.\n\n\u201cAt airports and sea ports, we are continuing with our Aedes-free campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding sources. With construction going on in several areas, this is especially important,\u201d said Dr. Kolandaisamy. A health information post continues to function at the airport, he said. The virus, spread over parts of South America, is transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which also transmits dengue.\n\nWhile the illness caused by the virus is reported to be a mild fever, it is said to be associated with microcephaly \u2013 where babies are born with an abnormally small head.\n\nRoutine checks are continuing on ships and aircraft, Dr. Kolandaisamy said. Passengers who have returned from Zika hotspots are being tracked and monitored. \u201cWe are ensuring that the areas they are live in are completely Aedes-free,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only cause for concern when it comes to this virus is its link with microcephaly,\u201d he said.\n\nAt any given point, there are an estimated 5 to 6 lakh pregnant women in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDengue incidence\n\nFever surveillance is continuing, Dr. Kolandaisamy said. Local body and Corporation employees are performing household checks to eradicate breeding sources. \u201cWith an increase in experience and resources, we have managed to control dengue too,\u201d he said.\n\nPockets for dengue in the State include Tirupur, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts, but the virus is being managed, he said. \u201cIn Tirupur, we have had no cases for two months now,\u201d he said.\n\nPassengers returning from Zika hotspots being tracked and monitored",
