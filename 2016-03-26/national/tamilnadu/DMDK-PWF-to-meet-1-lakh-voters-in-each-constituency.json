They will promote awareness on the alliance\u2019s election manifesto and common minimum programme through this campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will reach out to one lakh voters in each of the 13 constituencies by April 2. We will meet them at their doorsteps and distribute pamphlets on the election manifesto and common minimum programme,\u201d A. Narayanan, PWF alliance coordinator for Vellore district told reporters.\n\nA meeting of district secretaries of the DMDK \u2013 PWF alliance was held on Friday. The alliance will organise street corner meetings from April 5. They are also forming booth-level committees and vigilance committees, which will monitor and prevent distribution of cash to voters, he added.\n\nThe alliance plans to highlight unfulfilled promises of the AIADMK government in Vellore.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Minister had announced that the Vellore New Bus Stand will be expanded and developed like the Koyambedu bus terminus. The plan was to expand the terminus utilising 13.75 acres of land in the adjacent area but nothing has happened till now,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother issue that they plan to highlight is the lack of new industries in the district. \u201cThe government said new industries and IT park will be established in Vellore. Both the DMK and AIADMK governments failed to establish industries in the district in the last 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Narayanan said old age pension has been stopped for 3.5 lakh beneficiaries in the district without any information, and this too, will be taken up during the campaign. They said that infrastructure of the Vellore Corporation areas has not improved, and the underground sewerage scheme was not implemented properly.\n\nCurbing sand and stone quarrying will also be one of the agendas of the alliance\u2019s campaign in the district.\n\nOn April 4, DMDK leader Vijayakant\u2019s wife Premalatha will address a public meeting in the district. N. Subramanian of the MDMK was present.",
