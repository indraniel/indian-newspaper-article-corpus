Krishnasamy, the IX standard student was injured when a motorcycle hit the cycle he was riding on the way back from tea stall.\n\n\u201cI did not know that Krishnasamy was sent to buy tea and some medicine by Manimeghalai till I got the news that the boy sustained injuries and was taken to the hospital. Hence, I had suggested departmental action against the teacher concerned,\u201d Mr. Mani said. He disclosed some of his observations included in the report to the CEO.",
