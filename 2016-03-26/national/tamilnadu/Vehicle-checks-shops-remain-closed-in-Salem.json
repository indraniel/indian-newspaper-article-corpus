    "text": "The shops in various parts of the city remained close on Friday to protest against alleged harassment of traders by the election officials.\n\nThe traders of the district, affiliated to Salem City Chamber of Commerce and other traders\u2019 bodies, are on a warpath against the poll officials. They alleged that the traders were being harassed in the guise of vehicle checks by the flying squad personnel.\n\nThe shops situated in the main trading centres such as Shevvapet, Leigh Bazar, Chathiram, Paul Market, New Bus stand, Old Bud stand, etc downed shutters on Friday. These ever busy areas wore a deserted look.\n\nA. Jayaseelan, general secretary, Salem City Chamber of Commerce, said that more than 30 different traders bodies participated in the agitation and did not open their shops. He said that the traders will not be in a position to produce the documents mentioned by the Election Commission while carrying money for their business transactions. Mr. Jayaseelan said that the traders will produce the PAN card and TIN card provided by the State Commercial Taxes Department to the authorities. The chamber will give authorisation letter to the petty traders who did not possess the above two cards. The officials should accept the documents.\n\nMr. Jayaseelan said that they will continue their agitation till Election Commission conceded their demand. They will be forced to take serious decisions like boycotting polls, if the authorities continued to harass the traders.\n\nHe said that a meeting of the various traders\u2019 association is scheduled on March 28 to discuss the future course of action.",
