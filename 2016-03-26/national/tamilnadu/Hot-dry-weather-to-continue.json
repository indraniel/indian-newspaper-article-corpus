    "text": "Be prepared for a hot, dry spell, at least for a week or so, is the message one gets from the Agro Climatic Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Weather managers say that in the past few days in Coimbatore, the temperate has been unusually high, with the mercury even touching 100 degree Fahrenheit a few days ago.\n\nSuch high day temperature coupled with increase in night temperature is likely to continue for a few more days not only in Coimbatore but also in Salem, Namakkal and the western region.\n\nThe first reason is equinox, when the Sun is directly over the head and is out for about 10 hours, the second is the moisture-less soil that radiates heat and less cloud cover. Sources say that Coimbatore residents may get relief once the North Westerly wind sets in. Until such time, the temperate will remain above normal for this month.\n\nAt present, it is the South Westerly wind that is blowing through the area.\n\nSummer showers will also help bring down the mercury, the weather managers say and add that the district is supposed get 136.2 mm rain during the season that extends from March to May.\n\nLast year the district had a bountiful summer showers with 266 mm.\n\nThe South West Monsoon will start by the third week of May and as of March 25, it will be difficult to predict the monsoon as the error margin will be high.\n\nThe average rainfall during the SW Monsoon season is 205 mm. Last year, Coimbatore received less than average rainfall. The season extends from June to September.",
