Fares as high as Rs. 4,000 for a berth in a second AC compartment are too high. The Railway Board should review the fares immediately. Passengers should not be exploited,\u201d said V. Rama Rao, an activist of the Traffic and Transportation Forum.\n\nJ.K. Raghunathan, president of Chennai Rail Passengers Association, said Railways could think of other means of augmenting its revenue and put its vast assets and properties to better use.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Railways should seriously consider slashing the fares for Suvidha trains,\u201d he said.\n\nOccupancy rate\n\nWhile conceding that the fares in upper classes (second and third AC) were high for the Suvidha trains, especially while booking closer to the departure date, officials said the special trains run by Southern Railway had 80 per cent occupancy.\n\nSleeper coaches had 100 per cent occupancy while there were vacant seats in the upper classes owing to the fares.\n\nThey added that Suvidha trains were run only when there was considerable demand from passengers.\n\nA ticket on a Suvidha train from Chennai to Madurai costs more\n\nthan Rs. 1,000",
