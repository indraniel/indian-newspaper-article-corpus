Pandi (25) of Padappai, working with a UPS service provider company. The police said that he attempted to withdraw money from the ATM and, annoyed with the machine not dispensing the cash, he removed the surveillance camera from the machine and fled the scene, the police added.\n\nThe bank manager filed a complaint and the Pallikaranai police found that the surveillance cameras fixed in the neighbourhood had recorded the incident. He was nabbed when he revisited the ATM kiosk next day and placed the camera inside. He was produced in court on Friday and sent to the Puzhal prison.",
