The meeting was organised to drive home the important aspects of the levy and clarify doubts.\n\nThe Commissioner informed them that the Centre had decided to constitute a sub-committee to interact with trade and industry on tax laws. He said the associations would be given an opportunity to represent before the committee and submit a representation. The committee would submit its report within 60 days of its constitution.",
