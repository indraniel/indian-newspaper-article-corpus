However, there are so many smart solutions with sensors available at a cheaper cost,\u201d said M. Elango, a senior manager with Innovative Trade Fairs, which is organising the exhibition.\n\nHe said that the fair would be helpful for those who wanted to build homes as well as commercial buildings. \u201cWe also expect many civil engineers, designers and architects to visit the exhibition,\u201d he added. Eighty-two stalls have been put up by companies at the fair, which will be open from 10.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. till Sunday.",
