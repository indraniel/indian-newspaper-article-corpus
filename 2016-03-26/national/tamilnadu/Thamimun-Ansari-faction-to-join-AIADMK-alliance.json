We will soon know about how many seats we are going to get,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ansari said that the decision to go with the AIADMK was taken by the party members on the basis that there have been no attacks on minorities in the State in the last five years. \u201cThe last five years have been peaceful with no violence against the minority communities. Like wise, our party will also stand for pluralism and will include members from all communities,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked how they would reconcile with the AIADMK\u2019s unfulfilled promise made in 2011 that they would increase the reservation for minorities, Mr. Ansari said that they would continue to push the ruling AIADMK on that issue.\n\nWith political parties trying to seek new alliances, Mr. Ansari said that his party would not support the AIADMK if the party decides to join hands with the BJP. \u201cIf that happens, we will not support the AIADMK,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ansari also said that he would not like to compete directly with the candidates fielded by the MMK in each constituency. \u201cWe will try to avoid that as much as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe party will soon conduct a public meeting in which several leaders associated with the AIADMK alliance are expected to speak.\n\n\u2018If AIADMK aligns with BJP, Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi will not support it\u2019",
