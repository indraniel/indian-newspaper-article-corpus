Though Tamil Nadu had been ruled by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam since 1967, the State is yet to attain the enviable status of \u2018Developed State\u2019 as these parties have miserably failed to execute mega schemes and developmental projects, she claimed.\n\nShe said the DMDK, in the first phase of electioneering, would organise public meetings in all Corporation areas to explain its manifesto to the voters.\n\n\u201cOnce the first phase is completed, the campaign will commence across the State.\u201d\n\nMs. Premalatha addressed a public meeting here to explain the salient features of the DMDK\u2019s manifesto.",
