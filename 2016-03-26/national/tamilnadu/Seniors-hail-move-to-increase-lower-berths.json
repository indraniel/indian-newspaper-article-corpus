Ragu\n\nPassengers have welcomed the move of the Railway Ministry to increase the number of lower berths allotted in long-distance trains to senior citizens and women.\n\nSix lower berths in sleeper and three in air-conditioned coaches have been reserved for senior citizens, pregnant women and women over 45 years old who are travelling alone. So far, it was four lower berths in sleeper and two in air-conditioned compartments.\n\nThe Ministry\u2019s notification, sources said, would mean that nearly 100 berths would be reserved for them in trains with 13 sleeper and 6 air-conditioned compartments.\n\nThis decision is bound to bring cheer to several thousand elderly and also pregnant women who travel in overnight trains every day. R. Sugantha, (85) recalled how upset she was when she did not get a lower berth recently. A relative of Ms. Sugantha booked tickets for a group of elderly passengers from Dindigul to Chennai in an express train scheduled to leave on July 8. They booked the tickets well in advance \u2014 in the first week of March.\n\n\u201cApart from Ms. Sugantha, there are three senior citizens in the group of 6 passengers. But we did not get lower berths,\u201d they said and hoped the new move would benefit the elderly.\n\n\u201cSome passengers give their lower berths to pregnant women, but many are reluctant to exchange it for senior citizens. It is very difficult for the elderly to get into the middle and upper berths and we welcome the notification,\u201d R. A. Mukunthan of Paranur \u2014 Perungalathur Rail Commuters Association.\n\nOver 100 berths would be reserved for the elderly, pregnant women and women travelling alone",
