P. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers\u2019 Association, said here on Thursday.\n\nGreen gram and black gram cultivated on rain-fed tracts are now being harvested. But, the farmers are disappointed over the yield. Against the normal yield of 400 kg per acre, this year\u2019s yield is put at 50 to 150 kg.\n\nEven during drought, the farmers did not experience such crop damage.\n\nAnticipating a good yield, these crops were sown over 1.5 lakh acres in the district, he said.\n\nHowever, sources in the Department of Agriculture said that the area under green gram and black gram had been increased in this harvest season. About 10,000 \u2013 15,000 hectares had been increased this year.\n\nWhile black gram was cultivated on around 40,000 hectares, green gram had been covered on 55,000 hectares in rain-fed blocks of Pudur, Vilathikulam, Ottapidaram, Kayathar and Kovilpatti.
