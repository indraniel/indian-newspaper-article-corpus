Kailasm\u2019s Centenary celebration Mr. Vairamuthu delivered a speech in the presence of the Chief Justice of Madras High Court S.K. Kaul, actor Rajinikanth and other dignitaries, including former union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. \u201cIn his speech Mr. Vairamuthu created doubt about the faith, integrity, purity of the Judges among the public, especially about judges who are on the eve of retirement.

Mr. Vairamuthu had tendered an apology for the speech, it is learnt.\n\nIn his speech Vairamuthu raised doubt about integrity, purity of judges",
