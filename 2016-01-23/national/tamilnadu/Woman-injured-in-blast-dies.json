Muthammal (74), who was referred to Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital in Tiruchi after being given first aid at Perambalur GH died in the morning. The blast on Thursday evening caused multiple injuries on the head, face and limbs of the frail woman, who had a daughter and three sons.\n\nOn a complaint from the local VAO, V. Kalathur police booked a case on Thursday under IPC section 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) read with section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act. Consequent to the death of the woman, the case would now be altered, say the police.\n\nSpecial police teams have been constituted to probe the case. The blast, police said, was of low intensity as only a portion of the wooden box got damaged.",
