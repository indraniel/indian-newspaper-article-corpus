Rajesh\n\nThis Panchayat Union Middle School at Boothalapuram in Vilathikulam taluk was upgraded as high school in 2010 and as higher secondary school the next year. However, upgrading of the school, in which most of the students are Dalits, is yet to reflect in its infrastructure.\n\nConstruction of additional buildings to accommodate more classes has been going on at a snail\u2019s pace. As a result, classes are conducted under trees. This school had been upgraded academically, but not in infrastructure, P. Murugesan, social activist from N. Chinnaiyapuram village, told The Hindu on Friday.\n\nWith allocation of Rs.50 lakh from the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, construction of new classrooms was taken up in 2011. But, the work has not been completed even in 2016..\n\nDespite taking up the issue to the attention of Collector M. Ravikumar several times, no effort had been made to complete the construction work in the school, which had 385 students, said Mr. Murugesan.\n\nChief Educational Officer M. Ramakrishnan said that almost 80 per cent of construction was over with the allotted fund and more funds had been received to complete the work.\n\nThe school had been asked to submit a plan to complete the work at the earliest, he said.",
