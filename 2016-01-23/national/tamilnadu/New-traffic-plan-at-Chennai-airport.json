Now, some minor work is underway on the service road and it will be finished soon. We hope to throw open the new plan for passengers in about two months.\u201d\n\nAccording to the new plan, domestic passengers can enter the airport from the centre ramp and exit through the right while the international passengers can enter from the left and exit through the centre median.\n\nRoundabout route\n\nFor years now, owing to the construction of the Chennai Metro Rail station and the centre ramp inside the airport, vehicles had to take a roundabout route.\n\nPassengers, who were leaving the Chennai city in both domestic and international flights, had to take the ramp on the right side of the airport.\n\nThe vehicles could exit only at the left end owing to the non-completion of the centre ramp.\n\nDrivers\u2019 complaints\n\nThe new plan is expected to be a great relief to the passengers and those dropping them off. Several people had earlier complained that the detour made it difficult for them to drop their acquaintances outside the departure halls of the domestic or international terminals.\n\nThis is also due to a 10-minute rule which requires the motorists to enter and exit the airport premises within this time, failing which they have to pay parking charges.\n\nDomestic passengers can enter the airport from the centre ramp and exit through the right",
