    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Friday directed Anna University, Chennai, to submit by Monday details of staff appointments made between 2007 and 2012, when the varsity remained split in to five regional universities, in order to ascertain the number of backlog vacancies that should have been reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nJustice D. Hariparanthaman issued the direction while hearing a batch of cases filed against the university accusing it of attempting to fill up almost all teaching and non-teaching staff vacancies through direct recruitment without adhering to reservations meant for SC/ST candidates besides earmarking 75 per cent of the vacancies to be filled up through promotions.\n\nThe judge said a study of a list of people appointed would give a fair idea of the mode of reservation that should be followed in future.",
