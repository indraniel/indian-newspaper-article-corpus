    "text": "The Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK) warmed up to the ruling AIADMK in the Assembly. Its leader M.H. Jawahirullah said the State government acted promptly and cracked the whip on those who sought to denigrate Muslims on social media.\n\nMr. Jawahirullah also sought to defend the government when CPI(M) leader A. Soundararajan criticised the Governor\u2019s address for going soft on the Centre. \u201cIt has strongly condemned the Centre for not taking steps to retrieve the Katchatheevu,\u201d he said.\n\nBut his claim was disputed by CPI deputy leader S. Gunasekaran who read out a relevant portion from the Governor\u2019s address to prove that the government has just requested the Centre in this regard.\n\nMr. Jawhiruallah said a local BJP leader Velmurugan, who expressed joy over the tragedy held in Mecca, was arrested and another leader Kalyanaraman was arrested for posting derogatory remarks against the Prophet. The police also arrested the culprits responsible for the attack on autodriver Kader Mohideen in Yerwadi,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government should invoke its power guaranteed under Article 161 to release life prisoners including Muslims on the occasion of MGR\u2019s centenary celebrations.\n\nMr. Jawhirullah said the government should remove all encroachments on waterbodies and should not confine itself to removal of huts to prevent floods in the future.\n\nJawahirullah says the government acted against those who sought to denigrate Muslims",
