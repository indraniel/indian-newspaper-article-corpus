    "text": "Motorists going towards Kamarajar Salai via Wallajah Road were caught in a traffic gridlock due to a protest organised by Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association near the State Guest House in Chepauk on Friday. The protest was held to draw government\u2019s attention to abolish new pension scheme, resolve pay anomalies and ensure partial merger of dearness allowance with basic pay.\n\nR. Ashwin Kumar of Ganapathy Street, Triplicane, complained that motorists were forced to take a detour via Bells Road and Pycrofts Road to reach Kamarajar Salai, as the Traffic Police blocked a portion of Wallajah Road to allow the protest meeting to be held. Motorists questioned the rationale behind allowing a protest on a weekday.",
