SRINATH\n\nFarmers in parts of the district have been preparing the fields for groundnut cultivation, taking advantage of waters realised during the recent northeast monsoon.\n\nGroundnut cultivators say the showers have enriched the soil in various parts of the district.\n\nAs timely raising of the crop during the current \u201cThai\u201d pattam will benefit them in a big way, they have resorted to cultivating the crop. A large number of farmers were seen busy in making preliminary arrangements, particularly ploughing the fields for prospective harvest.\n\nMurugesan, a farmer of Mela Karuppur village, said that he had planned to raise groundnut on 20 cents of his fields.\n\nThe recent showers had come as a blessing for wetting the fields. He had been shifting the cultivation pattern for enriching the soil. From onion during the previous season, he was now raising groundnut.\n\nOfficials of Agriculture Department said the current season was ideal for raising groundnut.\n\nThe officials have been motivating farmers to take to mechanical planting of groundnut seeds which would not only bring down the cost of cultivation, particularly wages for labourers, but also for ensuring higher rate of germination, an official told The Hindu on Friday, explaining the special campaign being organised in the district to sensitise famers to this scheme.\n\nA new variety \u2018GPPD 4\u2019 is being popularised among the farmers. The duration of the crop is 130 days and per hectare yield would be one tonne in rain-fed areas and 1.5 tonnes in irrigated fields.",
