Talking to reporters here on Friday, Dr.Candavelou said, \u201cThe introduction of VVPAT is under the consideration of ECI. The new system is likely to be introduced in forthcoming polls. It is a system providing feedback to voter on whether he cast his vote or not.\u201d\n\nThe officials explained the VVPAT will generate printed-slip showing the candidate to whom he/ she cast the vote. The slip can be viewed by the voter and however cannot be taken away by the voter. It will be automatically collected in the collection compartment of the machine.\n\nDr. Candavelou said the ECI took stock of preparatory measures taken in the UT. He also briefed the ECI on deployment of men and materials.\n\nAdding that the officials and engineers have been conducting first level checks on electronic voter machines (EVMs), he said sufficient number of machines are available in the department.\n\nDr. Candavelou said as per instruction of ECI, the process is on to identify the officers who complete three years and such officers will be transferred before the end of this month.",
