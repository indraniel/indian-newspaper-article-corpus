    "text": "Pattali Makkal Katchi State deputy secretary C. Vadivel Gounder told The Hindu that the party plans to move High Court seeking a CBI inquiry into the alleged misuse of public money by the Tirupur Corporation administration during the execution of various projects.\n\n\u201cWe will go to the court if the State Government is not receptive to the demands for a CBI inquiry into the allegations that had been raised by different segments of the society,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a demonstration which the party held in front of the Corporation office on Friday.\n\nThe PMK men alleged that there was massive corruption in the execution of solid waste management in the wards where the project was privatised and also in the operations of public toilets.\n\n\u201cIn both the cases, there is a heavy mismatch in the number of workers assigned and the actual persons working at the ground. This means, huge amounts meant for salaries are siphoned off,\u201d said Mr. Gounder.\n\nSimilarly, services of 72 persons were said to be outsourced for various works in one of the zones in the Corporation and salaries to the tune of Rs. 17,136 were earmarked in total for a day. However, no such workforce can be seen in reality,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt has been found out that a company in Andhra executed the massive project. But, it has been found that the office of that firm, which is mentioned in the record, is a tiny one not of the stature of a big firm that carried out the works,\u201d they said.",
