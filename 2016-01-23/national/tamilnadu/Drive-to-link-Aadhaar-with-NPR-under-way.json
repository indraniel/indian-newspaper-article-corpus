    "text": ": The drive for linking of Aadhaar number with the National Population Registry (NPR) is currently under way in the district.\n\nAccording to an administration release, data synchronisation of NPR with Aadhaar is being taken up by administration appointed data collectors, who will make door-to-door visits. Public is requested to verify if all the details recorded in the NPR are accurate; if the data of the deceased members has been removed from the NPR; if newborn members of a household have been included in the NPR. The work has been taken up under the Citizenship Act 1955, and the Citizenship rules, 2003 across the State.",
