This will help passengers commute easily within the airport.\u201d\n\nEvery day, there are at least 30,000 passengers travelling through the airport; passengers have complained on various occasions that the lack of this facility had put them to major inconvenience.\n\nThe travelator had originally been a part of the project to modernise the airport at a cost of Rs. 2,000 crore. But the idea was scrapped as part of cost-cutting measures. In fact, the authorities had specially built a bridge with Y-shaped columns outside the terminals to provide connectivity to both terminals through this travelator. But it had never been taken up for years now.\n\nThe authorities had said the travelator may cost Rs. 50 crore; but sources said it was likely to cost more with increase in time to install it.\n\nCurrently, there is a travelator connecting the domestic and international terminals in the airside of the terminals (past the security check).",
