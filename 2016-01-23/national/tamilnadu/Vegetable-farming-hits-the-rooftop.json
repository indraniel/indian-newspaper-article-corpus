It was subsequently extended to Tiruchi and Madurai at a cost of Rs 5.37 crore, in 2015. A senior official of the department said the scheme would ensure nutritional security through fresh green vegetables.\n\nHe said demand for vegetable was fuelled by various factors, which include urbanisation, increase in per capita consumption and health consciousness.\n\nIn the urban setting, the desire to take up gardening and nurture plants is often not realised as space is hard to come by.\n\nWhen it comes to cultivation of vegetables, Tamil Nadu stands first, covering 2.76 lakh hectares. The production is 29.95 tonne per hectare at the national level.Dietary allowance\n\nThe per capita consumption of vegetables in India is 230 grams as against 300 grams of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad.\n\nWith the population growth projected to be 1,330 million in 2020, 1,460 million in 2030, 1,570 million in 2040 and 1,650 million in 2050, production of 190, 210, 225 and 240 million tonnes of vegetables is required respectively.",
