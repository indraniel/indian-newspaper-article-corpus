    "text": "The proposed traffic diversions announced by the police in the city, to facilitate the reconstruction of a culvert on Thennur High Road by the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation, were not enforced on Friday as the work did not commence.\n\nThe police, in a press release issued a few days ago, had announced that traffic diversions would be enforced from January 22 to facilitate the reconstruction of a culvert on the Virupachipuram Vaical, a major drain in the city, cutting across the road near the KMC Hospital.\n\nThe work was expected to go on for about two months. The Virupachipuram Vaical, which starts at Sangeethapuram and drains at Kathirikai Vaical near Ramalinga Nagar, cuts across several densely populated areas. The narrow culvert on the Thennur High Road at the stretch near the KMC Hospital has been unable to draw heavy water flow during monsoon season. The reconstruction of the culvert was meant to address the problem. The diversions were not enforced as the work did not begin on Friday. Sources in the corporation said the work would commence in the next few days.",
