So, whoever puts the sticker on their car becomes an initiator of sorts since he cannot honk himself as he is supporting the cause and all the others around him also get involved.\n\nOften, honking is either unnecessary, or it serves no purpose. The vehicle users should make a conscious decision not to blare the horn, except when it is really necessary.\n\nDuring this sticker campaign, HNOP awareness was created among all type of vehicle riders.",
