Elaborating on the Australian government\u2019s tough border protection measures called \u2018Operation Sovereign Borders\u2019, he said it was impossible for anyone coming by boat without a visa to settle in Australia.\n\nPeople undertaking such long and dangerous journey by boat were being intercepted and safely removed from Australian waters or sent to another country for regional processing.\n\nResettlement in Australia would never be an option.\n\n\u201cBetween 2008 and 2013, it is estimated that over 1,200 people died at sea trying to reach Australia. There were no known incidents under \u2018Operation Sovereign Borders\u2019 involving loss of life since December 2013,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the \u2018Q\u2019 Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police for intercepting and apprehending some suspects who tried to take some Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to New Zealand recently, Mr. Kelly said he had reasons to believe that the refugees were actually promised a trip to Australia.\n\nThe distance between the Tamil Nadu coast and Australia was about 3,000 nautical miles and New Zealand was even farther.\n\nThe top priority of the government was to prevent people from getting on boats and putting their lives at risk.\n\n\u201cPeople smuggling is an evil and criminal activity that must be opposed in every form it takes. Such smugglers steal peoples\u2019 money and put their lives in danger\u2026ultimately they do not give people what they promise. The Australian government has taken a firm decision to make it impossible for the people smugglers to sell their product,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\n\nThe only way for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to seek a refugee status in Australia was to return to their home country and approach through the United Nations High Commissioner Refugees.\n\n\u201cImpossible for anyone coming by boat without a visa to settle in\n\nour country\u201d",
