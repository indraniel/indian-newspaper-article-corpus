His body was found near the track the next day.\n\n\u2018He was in love with a girl belonging to a Hindu community. They warned him to stay away from her.

They threatened to carryout a State-wide protest if their demands are not met.\n\nMeanwhile, P. Vijayakumar, Superintendent of Police, Railways, visited the crime spot and held inquiries. He also held discussions with the Superintendent of Police G.
