This is the latest of the early warning system to be launched on Friday.\u2014 Photo: Special Arrangement\n\nPerhaps for the first time in the country, the government buses are being used as an early warning system to reduce human-elephant conflict.\n\nOn Friday, a unique automated announcement system in buses was launched in the highly human-elephant conflict prone Valparai plateau. This is in addition to the existing systems like TV crawls, elephant alert text messages and voice calls over people's mobile phones and elephant alert indicators.\n\nDatabase of locations\n\n\u201cWe already have a database of over 250 locations through eight years of elephant tracking information. The bus alert system will fill in one of the gaps,\u201d says Ananda Kumar, who won the Whitley Award (Green Oscar) in 2015 for the early warning systems that have helped reduced the human-elephant conflict in Valparai plateau.\n\n\u201cA lot of school children have special classes and return home to various estates from Valparai town in buses around 7.30 p.m. The children do not have mobiles and they have to walk to their homes. This is where the bus alerts help,\u201d he says.\n\nSix routes covered\n\nInitially, six routes covering major part of the estates have been fitted with the announcement devices.\n\n\u201cIt will also help people who don\u2019t own mobile phones and those who can\u2019t read messages,\u201d the scientist says.\n\nThe system will reduce conflict, as it will eliminate surprise encounters, prepare the bus passengers so that they have enough time to take precautions, he points out.\n\n\u201cA sudden encounter can be scary for both elephants and humans. Through the early warning systems, the unpleasant incidents could be avoided,\u201d he emphasises.\n\nAnbu Abraham, general manager, TNSTC, inaugurated the system.\n\nV. Asokan, District Forest Officer, Anamalai Tiger Reserve; K.S. Shanmuga Velayudham, deputy manager, Mr. K. R. Muthusamy and forest ranger officers participated.",
