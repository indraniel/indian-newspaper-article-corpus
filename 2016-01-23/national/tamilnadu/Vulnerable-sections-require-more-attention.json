    "text": "Frequent accidents are reported from certain sections of the western and northern suburban railway lines.\n\nT. Sadagopan, activist from Pattabhiram, said the section between Avadi and Thiruninravur, including Hindu College and Nemilichery, was extremely dangerous. \u201cUnlike the Chennai Beach - Tambaram southern line, these lines have only a few subways and foot overbridges. Given this, commuters often have not choice but to cross the tracks.\u201d A loco-driver told The Hindu that a fatal accident took place near the Nemilichery railway station at LC gate no. 9 on Thursday. Railway officials also discovered that a number of victims were school and college students who cross the track while speaking or listening to music on their mobile phones.\n\nThe stretch near the Guduvanchery railway station is another high-risk zone as several hundred commuters take a short cut to reach either side of the track. Immediate short-term measures should be provided before permanent solutions are found, residents said. Peerkankaranai town panchayat chairman A.V. Sampathkumar said they had requested railway officials that at least a temporary foot overbridge across Perungalathur railway station be provided.",
