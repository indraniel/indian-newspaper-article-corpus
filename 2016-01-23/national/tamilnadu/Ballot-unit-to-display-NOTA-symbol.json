Over 46,000 voters from Nilgris Parliamentary constituency had opted for \u2018NOTA\u2019 \u2013 the highest among the 39 constituencies.\n\nEarlier, there was only a box which had the letters \u2018NOTA\u2019 but now, under the name of the last candidate would be a tab which would read \u2018None of the Above\u2019 in English and the same in Tamil. Also, the cross mark symbol would be the last symbol below the last symbol of the last candidate, official sources said.\n\nStationery procurement\n\nOfficials are in the process of procuring stationery for the polls. \u201cWe have called for a tender notification on January 8 and we expect to procure the material within two months.
