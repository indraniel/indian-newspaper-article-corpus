    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Physical Education and Sports University has developed a project that will take gymnasium to the rural schools. The \u2018gym to ham\u2019 (gym to hamlet) project envisaged by Vice Chancellor A.M. Moorthy will provide all facilities available in a gym to government schools in rural areas.\n\nThe proposal is to install gym equipment on a bus and take it to the village schools. \u201cThe aim of the project is to identify talent in the villages. There are talented youngsters who lose out as they don\u2019t have access to facilities,\u201d Prof. Moorthy said.\n\nThe project would be the first to be implemented once the university is granted Section 12 (B) status by the University Grants Commission. The University has applied for the status and is in the process of getting the status which will allow it to seek grants for research and develop its departments.\n\nThis year, a total of 2,308 students have graduated from various programmes in the university, including 42 Ph.D candidates and 973 persons who studied through distance mode. Besides13 students, including seven women, who are rank holders, will receive their medals from the Governor.",
