    "text": "Having undergone a lot of sufferings due to liquor menace, the Tamil Nadu women will teach an unforgettable lesson to the ruling AIADMK in the forthcoming Assembly polls, MDMK general secretary Vaiko has said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Friday after attending a private function, Mr. Vaiko said thousands of angered Tamil Nadu women, who were undergoing untold sufferings due to social problems created by liquor, were waiting to teach an unforgettable and painful lesson to the AIADMK in the ensuing Assembly polls. Without understanding it, the Jayalalithaa-led government was refusing to impose total prohibition in Tamil Nadu even as the Kerala and Bihar Governments had started working on liquor-free States.\n\n\u201cPeople of Tamil Nadu will overwhelmingly support our alliance, which has been formed against corruption and liquor. If Natham Viswanathan (Minister for Power and Excise) fears that bootlegging would submerge Tamil Nadu when prohibition is promulgated, then what is the role of the police? Does he believe that Tamil Nadu police was inefficient? If he thinks so, all police stations in Tamil Nadu can be closed,\u201d Mr. Vaiko said.\n\nThe MDMK general secretary said the PWF\u2019s conference to be held at Madurai would be a turning point in the Tamil Nadu politics as the alliance was not only meant for elections.\n\n\u201cSince this is an alliance based on policies and principles, people of Tamil Nadu will certainly prefer us over other political parties,\u201d Mr. Vaiko hoped.\n\nHe opened the refurbished party\u2019s Tirunelveli city district office at Tirunelveli Junction in the night.",
