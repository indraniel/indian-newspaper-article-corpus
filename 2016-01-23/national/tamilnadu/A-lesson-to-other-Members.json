    "text": "The Tamil Nadu House Privileges Committee in its recommendations said DMK chief Karunanidhi must be meted out punishment for violating the privileges to serve as a lesson to others. However, it recommended that considering his age, the House should express its strong condemnation and warn that he should not indulge in such mistakes.\n\nAcrimonious scenes prevailed when the recommendations of the committee were taken up for adoption. Even before it could be tabled by Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman, head of the Privileges Committee, DMK MLA Durai Murugan claimed since the report of the committee was distributed to the Members, they had the right to discuss it. The demand was turned down by Speaker P Dhanapal.\n\nLeader of the House O. Panneerselvam placed a resolution before Assembly to adopt the recommendations in the midst of sloganeering by the DMK members. Some members tore the copy of the report and squatted on the floor. After the resolution was adopted by a majority vote, the Speaker warned the DMK members not to disrupt proceedings. Since the appeal made no difference, he ordered the House marshals to remove them.\n\nCPI (M) members urged the Speaker to allow them to discuss the report. To this, Mr. Dhanapal said an MLA of the party was present during the proceedings of the committee and his comments had been registered in the report.",
