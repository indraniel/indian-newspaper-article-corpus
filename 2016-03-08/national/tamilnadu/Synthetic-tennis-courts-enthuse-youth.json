MURALITHARAN\n\nWith enthusiasm writ large on their faces, youngsters practised at the synthetic courts under the watchful eyes of their coach at the tennis complex in Anna Stadium here.\n\nThe complex, which has been established at a cost of over Rs. 2 crore under the Self Sufficiency Scheme, was brought to public use recently.\n\n\u201cWe have been eager to play on these synthetic courts. The facility is good and we feel motivated,\u201d said Sherwin Isaac, a schoolboy and one of the trainees.\n\nThe tennis complex houses three flood-lit synthetic courts and galleries that can accommodate around 1,000 spectators.\n\nThe pavilion in the complex has a VIP gallery, dressing rooms for players and an office room. The Anna Stadium has a couple of clay courts as well.\n\nTiruchi has been hosting ITF (International Tennis Federation) men\u2019s Futures tennis championship for the past four years on the clay courts at Union Club.
