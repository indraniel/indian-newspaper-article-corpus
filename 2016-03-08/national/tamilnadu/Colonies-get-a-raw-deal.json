Narayanan, researcher, activist and director of the NGO CHANGEindia. According to the population norms of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, there should be one such centre for a population of 800. Both Kannagi Nagar and Ezhil Nagar have over 90,000 residents. While the former has 19, there are only five at Ezhil Nagar. Most of them function in flats constructed for displaced families living in the city slums and only around six operate from a building earmarked for them.\n\n\u201cThis a gross violation of ICDS norms. Why cannot they allot specific places for construction of the children\u2019s centres instead of dingy and cramped single-room flats that lack ventilation and sanitation,\u201d he asked.\n\nA door-to-door survey conducted last year by Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC) states that of the 1,345 children till the age of six, only 156 have access to the government ICDS centres in Kannagi Nagar, while in Ezhil Nagar, only 69 of the 534 children have access to them. \u201cThe situation has not really improved lately. The disturbing thing is that a similar model is being followed in Perumbakkam too,\u201d said Vanessa Peter, a policy researcher there.\n\nOfficials of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) claim that they are planning to increase the number of centres. \u201cWe have been liasoning with the State government and will soon build adequate number of child care centres in the colonies,\u201d said a senior official.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of children in this area who are out of school, malnourished and need basic facilities. We hope the issue is addressed soon,\u201d said Stephen Raj, a Kannagi Nagar resident.",
