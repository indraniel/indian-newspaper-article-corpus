Periasamy.\n\nThe Coir Board has designated P.A. Nijakumari from Alappuzha in Kerala, who has experience in the production of value-added products from coconut fibre and shell, the trainer.\n\n\u201cThe 20 women, who attend the programme here, are taught to manufacture handicrafts, ornaments, fancy items, and floor mats from coir over a period of nearly three weeks,\u201d said Ms. Nijakumari.\n\nAccording to her, coir products have a good market both within and outside the country.\n\n\u201cWomen who have received similar training in Kerala in the last few decades, are now earning well through the sale of coir products,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is a word of caution from Ms. Nijakumari for the trainees. \u201cThey have to constantly hone their skills and look for innovations themselves even after the current training session is over.\u201d",
