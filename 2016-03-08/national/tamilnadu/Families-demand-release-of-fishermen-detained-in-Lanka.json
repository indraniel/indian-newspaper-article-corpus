P. Santhya Pacheik, owner of one of three confiscated boats, said that residents of Threspuram \u2013 a majority of them country boat fishermen \u2013 were deeply saddened by their detention.\n\nThe detained fishermen were lodged in a prison at \u2018Neer Colombo\u2019 in Sri Lanka. Both Central and State government authorities should take necessary steps to secure their release at the earliest.\n\nFishermen from Tamil Nadu were often being arrested by Sri Lankan navy on the charge of cross-border fishing.\n\nThe Central government should introduce a new law to allow free \u2018hook and line\u2019 and \u2018gill net\u2019 fishing in marine waters, which did not by any means affect the marine ecosystem. The fishermen families submitted a petition to the district administration, and also met Superintendent of Police Ashwin M. Kotnis, seeking his help in this regard.",
