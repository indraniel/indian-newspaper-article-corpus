Particularly, Puducherry has been pushed to the situation of where there is no security forwomen who go alone.\u201d\n\nHe added that Women and Children Department, Women\u2019s Commission and All Women Police Stations have been functioning for namesake. While several States give 50 per cent reservation to women in local bodies, the AINRC has not come forward to conduct local body polls and failed to give such reservation besides betraying women, Mr. Viswanathan said.\n\nThe CPI leader said there is no security for women who go alone in Puducherry",
