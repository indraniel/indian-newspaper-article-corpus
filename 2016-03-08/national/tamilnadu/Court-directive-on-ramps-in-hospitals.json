Kaul passed the direction on a PIL petition moved by Jawaharlal Shanmugam who claimed that without ramps patients could not be evacuated from the buildings during emergencies due to natural calamities or man-made disasters.\n\nWhen the plea came up for hearing, all the authorities concerned said that the multi-storeyed hospitals that have come up after 2009 should mandatorily have ramp facility.\n\nAs far as the hospitals that were built before 2009 were concerned, it was submitted that such ramp will be made mandatory subject to the availability of space.\n\nAlternative arrangement\n\nIt was agreed that in case of lack of space, alternative arrangements would be thought of.
