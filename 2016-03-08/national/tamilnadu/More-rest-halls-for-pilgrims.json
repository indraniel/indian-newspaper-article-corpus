    "text": "The authorities of Sri Ramanathaswamy Temple have built two more rest halls near the railway station here to cater to the needs of pilgrims from north India who visit the temple for a day and cannot afford to book rooms in hotels to keep their belongings safe and take rest for a few hours.\n\nAfter building a 9,600 sq ft pilgrims\u2019 rest hall near the temple, which was inaugurated in September last, the temple authorities have now built two such halls for men and women at Rampark Thoppu near the railway station with locker facilities.\n\nThe two halls with about 120 locker facilities have been built at a cost of Rs. 2.20 crore, using temple fund, and they were inaugurated by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa through videoconferencing recently.\n\nAbout 1,500 men and women could take rest in the two halls, each measuring 9,600 sq ft, K. Mylvahanan, Assistant Divisional Engineer of the temple, said.\n\nThe pilgrims could leave their luggage and valuables in the lockers and the temple authorities proposed to collect a nominal fee of Rs. 50 per locker, he said.\n\nPresently the rest halls had no direct access from the railway station, and the temple authorities had requested the Madurai Divisional Railway Manager to provide access for the convenience of pilgrims, he said.\n\nThe halls had come up on 10 acres of temple land and had huge open space, enough for parking about 200 vehicles.\n\nThe temple authorities proposed to set up reverse osmosis (RO) system for providing drinking water to the pilgrims, he added.",
