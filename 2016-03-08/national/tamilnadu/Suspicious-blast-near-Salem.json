While police suspect that the blast was been triggered in a stone quarry, local villagers said the nearest quarry was some 7 km away from the affected place.\n\nAccording to police sources, people in Karipatti, Veeranam and Anmapatti heard a deafening blast around 4 p.m.\n\nThe shockwaves broke window panes in some houses. Cracks were found on the walls of a house and a shop in Mettupatti Paganur village. Local people told police that they saw a plane flying at a very low altitude.\n\n\u201cWe have a suspicion that the blast occurred in a stone quarry. There is also a possibility that workers drilling a borewell might have caused an explosion to break rock surface. There is no evidence of any plane flying at low altitude in the area,\u201d Inspector-General of Police (West Zone) C. Sridhar told The Hindu .\n\nHe said special teams were formed to investigate the incident. No suspicious objects were found in the affected areas.\n\nThe incident comes a month after a mysterious blast claimed the life of one person and injured three others on the campus of a private engineering college near Natrampalli in Vellore district.\n\nThough the State government claimed that it was a meteorite fall, scientists in national laboratories said no meteorite properties were found in the samples given to them.\n\nIn a separate development, the State police have stepped up security at vital installations amidst reports of possible terror attacks in major cities in the country on the Maha Shivarathri day.\n\nVillagers say they saw a plane flying at a low altitude, but police say there is no proof",
