Saravanan said that additional force had been deployed at all check-posts for effective monitoring. Round- the-clock surveillance had been intensified. Cash carried without supporting document would be seized. But a receipt would be issued.\n\nIf there were any poll code violations at marriage halls, cases would be filed against the owner of the property and cadres concerned.\n\nCases had been registered against 418 persons as a preventive measure, Mr. Saravanan added.",
