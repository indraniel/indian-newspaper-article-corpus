The stalls are spacious with well laid pathways for visitors to move around freely. As has been the trend of book fairs in recent years, children\u2019s, personality development, self-help, cookery, spirituality and text books dominate the collection on offer. Tamil titles clearly outnumber English ones.\n\nEducational and self-improvement CDs for children and adults are also available aplenty. Some of leading publishers including the Sahitya Akademi have set up stalls at the fair. Ten per cent discount is on offer on purchases. A food court forms part of the expo for visitors to refresh themselves.\n\nAlthough the BAPASI has been organising book fairs in Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai, this is the first time that it has set foot in Tiruchi to host a book fair based on a request from the State government to organise exhibition in the district headquarters. The government has also extended the venue at subsidised rentals, which make it an attractive proposition for the both the organisers and the exhibitors. The BAPASI has promised to make it an annual event in the city.\n\nThe book fair would be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. till March 13.",
