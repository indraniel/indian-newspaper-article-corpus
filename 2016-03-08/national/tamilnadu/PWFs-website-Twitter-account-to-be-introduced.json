Thirumavalavan, leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, here on Monday.\n\nOn the sidelines of a programme at a private engineering college near Nagercoil, Mr. Thirumavalavan said that the exercise was to woo the young and first-time voters in the Assembly elections.\n\nThe two Dravidian parties and the two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, were facing difficulty in forming alliances, because of the formation of the PWF.\n\nHe said that the Election Commission of India was functioning like a corporate company, as it could only handle the job of electronic voting machines during the elections and it had no teeth in controlling law and order.\n\nThe Assembly election was a direct contest between the ruling AIADMK and the PWF.",
