Door-to-door verification is on in connection with double entry, said Collector N. Venkatachalam.\n\nAddressing an all party meeting here on Monday, he said that election officials would thoroughly check all names in the list before polling. When representatives of opposition parties said that there were 18,700 double entries, Mr. Venkatachalam said that names of 13,824 voters were deleted from the electoral rolls of four Assembly constituencies in the district. Verification work was under way to remove the rest.\n\nA total of 1,177 polling stations had been set up in 512 centres in the four constituencies, he said.\n\nRepresentatives of political parties, mostly the opposition parties, complained that poll code violations were rampant in the district and demanded immediate action against the violators.\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam representatives complained that officials, who had completed three-and-a-half years of service, had been deputed for election duty, which was a poll code violation. Mr. Venkatachalam replied that they were not engaged in direct election duties. They were utilised only for indirect duties and that there were provisions in the Election Commission rules to depute them for such works, he said.\n\nDesiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam cadres complained that portraits of the Chief Minister had not been removed from government buildings, particularly from panchayat and panchayat union offices. But the officials replied that the portraits had been fully covered.",
