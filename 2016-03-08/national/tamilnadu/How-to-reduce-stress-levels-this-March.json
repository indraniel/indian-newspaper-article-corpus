But combating stress at this point is crucial, say experts, and there are a number of ways parents and teachers can help students get through the exam season.\n\n\u201cFirst off, a routine should be created. This is important, as it allows students to relax when they know what comes next. Along with studying, there must be a component of physical activity \u2013 twice a day for about half-an-hour each,\u201d said Shiva Prakash Srinivasan, a child psychiatrist associated with the Schizophrenia Research Foundation.\n\nSince this is a period where students revise, teachers should ensure they consolidate their pre-existing knowledge rather than acquiring more, he said.\n\n\u201cParents and teachers should also stop focusing on results so much. They should tell students to do their best and finish their exams. The results then are not in anyone\u2019s hands. They have to focus on the students\u2019 current efforts, and reinforce them,\u201d he said.\n\nAllowing children to express their fears and anxieties without inhibitions is also important, said V. Jayanthini, a city-based child psychiatrist.\n\n\u201cEffective communication between parents and children from a very young age onwards is needed. Parents need to motivate their children and allay their fears \u2013 but the way in which they do this is significant. Emotional support is very necessary for children,\u201d she said.\n\nReassuring children\n\nAsking children how you can help them, boosting them on up on their strengths and reassuring them that the efforts they are putting in will get them appropriate results can all help, the doctors said. \u201cIf there is a problem, parents should seek help. Consult another member of the family, a friend or get professional help. If parents feel students are over-anxious, worried or upset, it is best to get help as early as possible to prevent future problems,\u201d Dr. Jaynathini said.",
