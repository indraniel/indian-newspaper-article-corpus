The application for iOS for Apple phones will also be launched in a few days. The application would help the voter to avail the services of the Commission,\u201d Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said. The Commission also commenced a training session for officials involved in the electoral processes in the State on Monday. Mr. Lakhoni inaugurated the event intended to train Returning Officers.\n\nThe Commission also unveiled a mobile number \u2013 9444123456 \u2013 that the public could use to lodge complaints. Complaints, including images, can be sent to this number. Replying to a query, he said, \u201cThe usage of generic names in government schemes have been sorted out by the Commission earlier. We have instructed officials to ensure that the images of political leaders are not displayed on government schemes.\n\nAsked what was the Commission\u2019s position on symbols on small buses that would possibly resemble that of a political party, he said, \u201cEC instruction is that bit should be covered.\u201d",
