    "text": "Representatives of various political parties raised allegations of election model code of conduct violations and also aired voices of dissent to the instructions given by some officials to remove party symbols/flags from the party offices, during an interaction with Collector S. Jayandhi here on Monday.\n\nThe Collector convened the meeting of various political parties to brief them on the code of conduct and the general guidelines that the parties need to follow during the campaign.\n\nA. V. Vivekanandan, a lawyer who represented the DMK, came up with the accusation that a road project was started in a Corporation Ward after the code of conduct was enforced by the Election Commission.\n\n\u201cLikewise, a medical camp was organised by a political party on the premises of a Government school at Palladam to commemorate the birthday of the party\u2019s leader even after the announcement of poll dates,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nBoth these incidents need to be inquired and strict action need to be taken, he added. Congress leaders alleged that they were asked to remove the party name board and flags from the party office which, according to them, is not covered under the Election Commission guidelines.\n\nCPI (M) leader N. Gopalakrishnan had the complaint that flags and festoons of a particular party could be still seen in public places at Velampalayam.\n\n\u201cThe officials should be impartial when enforcing the code of conduct,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Collector and City Police Commissioner N. Manjunatha assured actions on the complaints, based on their merits.",
