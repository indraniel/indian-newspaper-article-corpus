Bharathi, who claimed to have won national-level events in rifle shooting and made a representation in March last, came up for hearing, the Additional Advocate-General submitted that various rewards and awards were being given for excellence in sports.\n\n\u201cAs to what sport should get the benefit is for the respondent authorities to consider. We may, however, observe that by no stretch of imagination can rifle shooting be said to be irrelevant to police duties. In fact, the idea is to encourage sports and in the present case, it is the sport which is directly relevant for police duties,\u201d the First Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh observed.\n\nWhen the Additional Advocate-General sought extended time, after the Bench gave a direction to favourably consider the request of the petitioner and a decision be taken within a maximum period of two months, the judges said, \u201c\u2026but we do not think this is a major policy decision which would require such a detailed examination\u201d and further disposed of the plea.\n\nThe petitioner had sought a direction to the authorities to include rifle shooting as sports event for appointment under sports quota and direct them to consider her case.\n\nWe do not think this is a major policy decision which would require such a detailed examination\n\nChief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh",
