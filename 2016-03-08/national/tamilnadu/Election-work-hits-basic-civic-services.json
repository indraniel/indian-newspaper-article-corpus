    "text": "Mosquito control and conservancy work disrupted\n\nAfter the model code of conduct came into force on Friday, civic services offered by the Greater Chennai Corporation are said to have been disrupted.\n\nCongress Councillor P. V. Tamil Selvan alleged that many of the services including conservancy work and mosquito control had been disrupted due to election work. Corporation workers have started focussing on defacing walls, which has been affecting other services.\n\nA senior official of Greater Chennai Corporation said officials had been instructed to ensure delivery of all civic services while the model code of conduct was in force.\n\nIn addition to disruption of services, there is the problem of ongoing civic projects being stopped midway.\n\n\u201cKavimani Salai and Sixth Main Road in ward number 91 are among roads that were milled recently. The work has been stopped now. This is causing difficulty to motorists,\u201d said Mr. Tamil Selvan.\n\n\u201cRestoration of some roads damaged due to water supply projects have been suspended after announcement of elections,\u201d said T. Palani, a resident of Kalamegam Street in Mogappair.\n\nWorkers involved in repairs of streetlights have also been busy with election-related works.\n\n\u201cThe number of labourers has reduced to three from 14, a few years ago. Many have retired and new appointments have not been made. So, we have to rely on other workers,\u201d said an official at the ward level. Processing of Form 7 for deletion of names has been affected after the announcement of elections, said an official.\n\nOngoing civic projects including road restoration have been\n\nstopped midway",
