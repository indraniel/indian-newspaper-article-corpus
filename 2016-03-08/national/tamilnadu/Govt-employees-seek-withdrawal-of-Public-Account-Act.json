    "text": "The Pondicherry State Government Employees Central Federation has urged the Centre to withdraw the Public Account Act immediately as the fiscal position of the Puducherry Government is in deep trouble due to financial mismanagement.\n\nTotal debt\n\nTalking to reporters here on Monday, P. Lakshmanaswami, president of the Federation said that ever since the Government started the Public Account fund in 2007, the total debt had gone up to Rs.6,700 crores in 2014. It was just Rs.2,168 crore from 1964 to 2011.\n\nThe government had also withdrawn from the GPF and other funds which was the hard earned savings of employees.\n\nThe situation in many PSUs like PASIC, PAPSCO and Cooperative institutions are no better and the employees remain unemployed ranging from two months to 60 months.\n\nDied of penury\n\nOver 50 workers had died of penury and their families were finding it difficult to make both ends meet, he alleged. The revenue growth of the UT that remained at 20 per cent from 2002 to 2012 dropped to 4 per cent from 2012-16 resulting in non-realisation of Rs.500 crore per year.\n\nThe government was not able to mop up revenue due to financial mismanagement, poor governance and malfunctioning of the system, he said.\n\nDisputing the statement of Chief Minister N. Rangasamy who recently said the financial position of Union territory was in good condition, Mr. Lakshmanaswami alleged that the government was in deep crisis and he was ready for a debate on the issue.\n\nIf the current trend continued, it might lead to deteriorating of Law and Order and increase in incidents of suicide.\n\nThe Federation has also demanded the Government to implement the Right to Service Act and appoint Lok Ayukta in the Union Territory.",
