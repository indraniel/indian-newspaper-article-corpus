It provides options for three categories of cities as classified by the VI Pay Commission.\n\nFor instance, the committee has fixed a maximum cap of Rs.1,44,900 to Rs.1,58,300 a year for colleges offering four-year BE/B Tech, depending on where they are situated.\n\n\u201cFee revision was done in 2012 and it was due last year, but the government did not take it up. The committee\u2019s fee guideline is 60 per cent more than what the State government has fixed currently,\u201d reasons K. Paramasivam, president, Association of Managements of Coimbatore Anna University Affiliated Colleges. Since the council itself was in limbo for nearly a year and without a chairman for many months, private engineering college representatives question the relevance of the report.\n\n\u201cWe have been representing repeatedly to Anna University about the difficult situation smaller colleges are in,\u201d says secretary of the ssociation A.K. Natesan.\n\n\u201cAnna University has announced a scheme to upgrade colleges with new machinery. But many college buildings are hypothecated and we pay steep interest rates. It will be difficult to take up any improvement with the current fee structures,\u201d he adds.\n\nA college official in Puducherry said since the Union Territory also had a fee committee it was still uncertain whether the council\u2019s report would be taken as the last word.\n\nS. Vaidhyasubramanian, Dean of Planning, SASTRA, however, felt that the committee\u2019s \u201crecommendation may be harmoniously adopted to ensure uniformity and encourage transparency. There is room for institutions with advanced facilities to have a 20 per cent increase, and anyway markets will decide how \u2018advanced\u2019 the facilities are,\u201d he said, arguing for the implementation.",
