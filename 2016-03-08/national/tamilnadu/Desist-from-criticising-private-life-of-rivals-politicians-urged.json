    "text": "Collector T.P. Rajesh, who is also the District Election Officer, on Monday asked the political parties not to criticise the private life of leaders or candidates.\n\nIn a statement, he said the criticism of political parties should be confined to the policies and programmes, past record, and work of candidates or parties. They should avoid making personal attacks. Criticism of other parties based on unverified allegations or distortion should be avoided.\n\nStating that the model code of conduct had come into effect, he said teams had been set up to monitor the implementation of model code of conduct.\n\nUnder no circumstances, the political parties should indulge in corrupt practices such as bribing of voters with cash or kind and intimidation of voters.\n\nAction would be taken against the violators as per the law. Similarly, the values of religions must be respected. Mosques, churches, temples, and other places of worship should not be used as forum for election purposes or canvassing of voters.",
