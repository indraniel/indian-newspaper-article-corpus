Green Cross India has been helping the rural public, particularly agricultural workers, to cope with the misery inflicted by snakebite by facilitating access to treatment and making available information about treatment.\n\nThe other activities of GCI include snakebite safety training in high-risk rural areas and promoting study and research. Alongside, the key task of rehabilitating tribal snake catchers and snake charmers is also carried out.\n\nThe GCI, last year, exposed Forest and Fire and Rescue Service personnel to a training programme at Anthiyur. The trainers sensitised the personnel to the myths surrounding snakebite, and the importance of primary first aid before further treatment.",
