Ravindran (48), who committed suicide near the refugee camp at Uchapatti on Sunday, was cremated on Monday after post-mortem.\n\nPolice said that a case of abetment to suicide was registered against retired Revenue Inspector Duraipandian, who was accused of having shouted at Ravindran to go ahead with his suicide plan.\n\nRoll call\n\nDuring a periodical roll call on Sunday, Duraipandian had marked absent for Ravindran, who had gone out reportedly to attend on his son who was admitted to a hospital.\n\nRavindran had pleaded with Duraipandian not to mark him absent since it would affect his prospects of getting government benefits meant for the refugees. When Duraipandian refused to heed his plea, Ravindran climbed up a tower and touched a high-tension electric line and fell down dead. Leaders of various political parties and organisations staged a protest claiming that it was Duraipandian who drove Ravindran to commit suicide, and sought action against him.",
