Hence, to create awareness among the electors so that they vote in the coming Assembly elections, Sankari Division Electoral Registration Officer and Returning Officer, S. Paul Princely Rajkumar initiated a programme under the Systematic Voters\u2019 Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP).\n\nHence, a team of students spent a full day in the village interacting with them and explaining them the importance of voting through various methods.\n\nThe programme started with door-to-door campaign by students making rangoli in each house, visiting school students with sweets and playing programmes from FM radios.\n\nLater, the students performed folk dances and dramas that explained the importance of voting. The day ended with students along with villagers taking oath that they will vote without fail.",
