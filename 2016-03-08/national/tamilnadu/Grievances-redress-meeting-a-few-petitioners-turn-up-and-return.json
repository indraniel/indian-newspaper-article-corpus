Periasamy\n\nThe district administration did not hold the weekly grievances redress meeting on Monday as the model code of conduct is in force. It had sent a press release asking aggrieved members of the public and petitioners to not turn up at the Collectorate and return disappointed.\n\nNotwithstanding the communication from the administration, quite a few people/associations turned up at the Collectorate with petitions, say sources.\n\nThe goldsmiths\u2019 association representatives went with the petition seeking a system to licence smithies, fix minimum wages for goldsmiths and bringing under Factories Act the owners of the smithies and a few other demands.\n\nLikewise, the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board Workers Union members also went to the Collectorate seeking permanent employment for those appointed under contract system in 1997. But they had to return without meeting officials.\n\nThe sources also said that a few villagers had also turned up with their grievances, but the police men on duty sent them away by explaining that the grievances redress meeting was not being held.",
