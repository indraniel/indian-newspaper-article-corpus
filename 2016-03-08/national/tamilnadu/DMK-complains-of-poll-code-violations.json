Karunanidhi, advocate and DMK State general council member, said that the Election Commission of India had announced poll dates for Tamil Nadu and directed the government to stall new works as it could attract voters. But the Corporation of Madurai had chosen to post on its Facebook page the inauguration of \u201cNamma\u201d toilets by Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa. \u201cThe corporation posted it on its Facebook page at 10.38 a.m. on Monday, which is in violation of the code of conduct,\u201d he alleged, and demanded action against the officials concerned.\n\nIn a similar complaint, the DMK members, led by Madurai urban district secretary Thalapathi, said that AIADMK Minister Sellur K. Raju had influenced officials and prevented them from erasing wall paintings of their leader Jayalalithaa.\n\nSpecifying some locations where there were such paintings, they said that the AIADMK men had covered the paintings with clothes. This was in total violation of the model code of conduct. The paintings should be erased and action should be taken against the erring officials, they said.\n\nThe District Election Officer assured them that he would look into the complaints. Later, in the evening, the Facebook post on \u201cNamma\u201d toilets was removed.",
