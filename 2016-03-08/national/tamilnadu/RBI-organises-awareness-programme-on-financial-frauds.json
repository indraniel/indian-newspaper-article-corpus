    "text": "In a bid to create awareness on safe investments and financial frauds, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Chennai conducted a financial awareness programme at the Government Girls Higher Secondary School, K.V. Kuppam recently.\n\nThe programme was aimed at educating school students and public on the pitfalls of investing hard-earned money in seemingly attractive schemes of fraudulent entities. These entities lured public with promises of quick gains, according to a press release.\n\nThe recent spurt in such schemes soliciting public money on the pretext of investment in land raised the need for such an awareness campaign. RBI\u2019s initiatives to empower the common man to take financial decisions were highlighted.\n\nIn addition, the precautions to be taken in cases of phishing emails / SMS were explained to the public. The complaint redressal mechanism against banks and non-bank companies in the RBI, such as banking ombudsman scheme was explained. Four banks put up stalls to enable public to exchange soiled/mutilated notes and obtain coins as part of the campaign, the release added.\n\nThe RBI, Chennai had conducted a meeting on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) related issues last week. The meeting was chaired by V. Vasanthan, chief general manager, RBI, Chennai.",
