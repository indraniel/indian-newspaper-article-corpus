    "text": "The delay in construction of an overhead tank and laying pipelines for few km length in the city is delaying the trial run of the Phase II of the Mettur \u2013 Salem Dedicated Water Supply Scheme as the project is expected to take another one month for completion. The project is implemented in two phases, Phase I at Rs. 188.42 crore which was completed, and Phase II at Rs. 132.12 crore.\n\nAfter the completion of Phase I, 102 mld (million litres a day) of water was being supplied to residents in all the 60 wards. However, the project cost had escalated from Rs. 188.42 crore to Rs. 199.30 crore. Under the Phase II, new pipelines have to be laid for 68 km length of which 66.15 km was completed so far. Of the 22 overhead tanks to be constructed, 21 tanks were constructed.\n\nOf the 135 km length distribution line to be laid, pipelines were laid for 128.15 km. So far, the corporation has spent Rs. 113.41 crore for the project. Though work was expected to be completed by February end, the delay in construction of tank and laying pipelines led to overall delay of the project.\n\nIt would take more than a month to lay the pipelines and test the lines for water leakage and rectifying it. Hence, the assurance by the corporation that drinking water would be supplied to all residents once in two days could not be implemented immediately.\n\nThe project is implemented in two phases, of which\n\nPhase I is completed",
