They were helpless, unable to extricate themselves until volunteers came to their aid.\n\n\u201cThe animals were in a bad condition when we found them,\u201d said Dawn William from Blue Cross.\n\n\u201cThe neck of one of the animals was caught in the other\u2019s horns and they both looked suffocated. Luckily, we were informed on time,\u201d he said.\n\nAround 3 p.m., volunteers from Blue Cross rushed to Gandhi Nagar, Madipakkam, and began their work to separate the animals, which had been stuck for four hours.\n\nThey took out a hacksaw blade and cut a horn of one of the animals and set them free.\n\n\u201cIt was a miracle that they even survived. Going by past incidents of this nature, one animal dies,\u201d said Dawn.\n\nThe volunteers later fed the stray buffaloes with water and sent them away in opposite directions.",
