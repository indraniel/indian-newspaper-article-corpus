About 500 performing artists, including solo dancers and 40 dance troupes, will participate in the festival.\n\nThe five-day event that would go on till March 11 would see a host of performers, including those from India and U.K., U.S, Singapore, Reunion Islands staging performances.\n\nIt would be interspersed with classical forms such as Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam, Kathak, Odissi, Manipuri, Vilasini Natyam and Gaudiya Nirtya.\n\nA. Sambandam, secretary of the Natyanjali Trust said that ever since the inception of the dance festival the event had acted as a catalyst in promoting and nurturing the classical dance forms.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Natyanjali festival lies in its devotional aspect and thus differs from other dance festivals.\n\nThe schedule is a mix of individual as well as group performances, each lasting about 20 to 25 minutes.\n\nIt is a policy of the Trust that it would allow any solo dancer or a dance school to stage performance only after a gap of four to five years and that too if they had anything innovative to offer. Akilan students of Ariyalur gave the inaugural performance on Monday.",
