Kaul on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition moved by Change India organisation seeking to quash a Government Order (GO) dated August 18, 2015 issued by the School Education Secretary and consequently to forbear Chief Secretary, Directorate of Matriculation Schools, School Education and Elementary Education from granting recognition to unrecognised schools which have not fulfilled the mandatory norms.\n\nThe petitioner also wanted the court to ensure that all the unrecognised schools are closed by the end of the academic year 2015-16 and to ensure that the students of such schools are placed in other neighbourhood government/ aided/ unaided schools.",
