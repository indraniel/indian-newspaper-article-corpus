    "text": "Police will take all out measures to ensure upkeep of law and order in the southern districts so that the common man could exercise his franchise without fear in the Assembly elections, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, R. Dinakaran, has said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Monday after assuming office, Dr. Dinakaran said that maintenance of law and order, especially during the run-up to the forthcoming Assembly elections, would be accorded highest priority so as to instil confidence in the minds of people. The visible policing that would be ensured at every level would encourage every voter to cast his or her vote in the election without fear.\n\nSinister designs of caste and communal outfits would be crushed with an iron hand, he said.\n\nWhen Dr. Dhinakaran served in the district as Superintendent of Police, he convened a police-public meet at Valliyoor in July 2008 after a sudden spurt in property offences orchestrated by three persons through \u2018kangaroo courts\u2019. On receiving complaints from the public during the meet, swift action was taken to thwart the designs of anti-social elements and many traders got back their properties usurped through coercion.",
