Muthukumar, secretary of the federation, who led the protest, said that around 1,500 contract workers had been working with the TTPS for the last 15 years on daily wages.\n\nThe TTPS administration should regularise their services from April and stop outsourcing work.\n\nThe contract workers were entitled to get the benefits of employees provident fund (EPF), but there was no transparency since they were not aware of their EPF numbers to claim the benefits. The EPF contribution should have been clearly mentioned in the wage slip of every worker, but it was not so.\n\nThe workers were exposed to air pollution caused by coal dust, fly ash and chemical effluents. Many of them were afflicted with respiratory problems and skin ailments. Hence, they must be given allowance to meet medical expenses.",
