Sridharan, an Assistant Manager in Tamil Nadu State Transport Department, said that on March 7 he had filed a complaint of cheating against Thennarasu, who claimed to be the friend of an associate of former State Transport Minister V. Senthil Balaji. The petitioner claimed that he got acquainted with Thennarasu through a conductor employed with the TNSTC. Thennarasu allegedly promised to secure jobs in the TNSTC for some candidates who have received interview letters from the Corporation.\n\n\u201cBelieving his words I paid Rs. 1.86 crore to secure employment for people known to me who had applied for jobs in the TNSTC,\u201d Sridharan said. But Thennarasu was unable to get them employment. While he returned Rs. 66.5 lakh to the petitioner, the remaining Rs 1.14 crore was given through two cheques, which were dishonoured by the banks. Sridharan had lodged a complaint with the Commissioner of Police which was subsequently forwarded to Central Crime Branch . Alleging that so far no action has been taken , the petitioner moved the court to depute an officer in the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police to register a case .",
