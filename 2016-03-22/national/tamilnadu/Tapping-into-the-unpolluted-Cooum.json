    "text": "A check dam is being built near Putlur in Tiruvallur district to prevent wastage of floodwater\n\nTo save resources in the unpolluted stretch of Cooum river, Water Resources Department (WRD) is building a check dam near Putlur, located nearly 25 km upstream of Maduravoyal.\n\nThe river, which originates in Tiruvallur district, runs for a total distance of 65 km. Of this, a stretch of 40 km still remains unpolluted and the water from there is used for drinking and irrigation purposes. To save more floodwater that would otherwise drain into the sea, the WRD is constructing the check dam, a structure built across the riverbed to break the flow of the river and store it.\n\n10 p.c. work over\n\nAbout 10 per cent of the work on the construction of the 180-metre-long and 2.7-metre-high check dam at Putlur in Tiruvallur district has been completed.\n\nThis is two km from Manavala Nagar, Tiruvallur district.\n\nWater for six months\n\nOfficials of the WRD said: \u201cWe will be able to store nearly 300-400 million cubic feet of water for about six months. This is equal to nearly half a month of the city\u2019s drinking water supply. It was decided to build a check dam on the site following a long-pending demand from the residents. The structure will store water for one km upstream in the river. This will mean recharge of groundwater in surrounding villages, including Vengathur, Thiruvoor and Sevvapet.\u201d\n\nAt present, residents are supplied with 810 million litres of water every day.\n\nOnce the check dam is constructed, nearly 400 borewells around the riverbed will have better groundwater recharge.\n\nThe Rs. 6.5-crore project is expected to be completed before the onset of the northeast monsoon, said an official.\n\nMeanwhile, Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust is also reviewing the possibility of building more check dams across the river to save resources.\n\nAt present, there are only four or five check dams across the waterway and they are in a dilapidated condition following the deluge in November and December last year.\n\nWhile welcoming the move to build the check dam in Putlur, residents want more such structures to be constructed to cater to the drinking water needs of residents living along the river.\n\nNeed for more\n\nMugundhan. K., coordinator of Unpolluted Cooum River Protection Committee, said: \u201cIt is essential to build at an interval of every few km in the river. Several people in villages like Anaikattuchery and Soranchery located upstream of Avadi still drink water from the Cooum river. If more resources are stored, it can be supplied to Chennai residents.\u201d\n\nPointing out that the check dams in Kannapalayam and Paruthipattu are in dire need of attention, he said: \u201cWe lost much floodwater because the Paruthipattu check dam was not maintained properly.\u201d",
