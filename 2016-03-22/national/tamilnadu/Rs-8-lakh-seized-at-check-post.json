    "text": "The flying squad deployed at the check-post at Puliyarai on Tirunelveli-Kerala border seized Rs. 8 lakh from a railway contractor, Mallikarjuna Rao, on Monday.\n\nPolice sources said that during interrogation Mr. Rao reportedly told the flying squad members that he, after withdrawing the cash from Tenkasi branch of a nationalised bank, was taking it to Kerala for disbursing salary to his workers.\n\nHowever, he was reportedly unable to provide the original or copy of the salary bill raised for disbursing the wages to the workers though he was carrying the current account passbook of the bank and showed the withdrawal details.\n\n\u201cSince he could not prove the purpose of carrying the hefty sum, the cash was seized and deposited in the treasury. He can get it back on producing the salary bill,\u201d said the police.",
