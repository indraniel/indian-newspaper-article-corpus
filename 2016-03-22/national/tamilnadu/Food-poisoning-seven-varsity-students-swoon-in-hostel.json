They were rushed to the Government Hospital here for treatment.\n\nDoctors said that their condition was stable. A Food Inspector would test the food samples and inform whether the food was contaminated or not.\n\nThe students alleged that the hostel cook served them the food prepared in the day for dinner. Several students had been suffering from stomach problems since Sunday night, and they somehow managed to wait till Monday morning. Some girls vomited and swooned in the morning, the students alleged.\n\nJoint Director of Health Services M. Ravikala, along with Deputy Director of Health Services S. Varadharajan and Kodaikanal Revenue Divisional Officer N. Suresh, inspected the hostel. Food samples were collected from the hostel for chemical analysis. The samples would be sent to the lab for tests and further action would be taken on the basis of the report, they said.\n\nRoad blockade\n\nOnly last month, the students had blocked the road in front of the university, condemning the poor quality of food being served to them and lack of facilities in the hostel.",
