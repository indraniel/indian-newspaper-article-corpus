GOVARTHAN\n\nThe Erode District Chemists and Druggists Association has instructed retailers in its fold to remove the 344 drugs banned by Health Ministry from the racks with immediate effect.\n\nThere are nearly 650 retailers in Erode Revenue district and over 60 wholesalers. So far, 17 pharmacy companies had asked for stocks of the banned drugs, said Kaliannan, president of Erode District Chemists and Druggists Association.\n\nThe communication has been sent. The retailers are required to send back the stocks of banned drugs to the wholesalers, who, in turn, will return the same to the pharma companies. The possibility of loss for the retailers due to the ban has been minimised.\n\nThe large-scale ban has taken the drug sellers by surprise. Nevertheless, it is the duty of every retailer to desist from selling banned drugs. \u201cA banned drug must not be in trade. The retailers have been instructed to put all the banned drugs in a box at a visible place with the inscription \u2018Not For Sale\u2019, Mr. Kaliannan said.",
