But lack of awareness has been a major hurdle in implementing the same, said participants at a programme got up by the Network of Institutions for Disabled near BHEL campus on Monday. They emphasised the role of parents and special teachers in guiding the differently-abled persons.\n\nS. Martin, coordinator, said 80 schemes were implemented by the Union and State government for the people with disabilities.\n\nOne of the guidelines stipulated under the \u201cDisabilities (Equal Opportunities and Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1995\u201d was that children with disability should be admitted to government schools so as to ensure regular stream of educational opportunities,\u201d he said and added that the parents were sensitised to the educational rights of the people with disabilities.\n\nS. Vincent, organiser for the event, said 150 students from various special schools in and around Tiruchi participated in the event. Accompanied by their parents, the special students were taken for an entertaining ride by a joy train and went around the deer park. The programme was organised as part of the observance of World Down Syndrome Day on Monday, he added.\n\nPaulin said that Down Syndrome was not a disease but a genetic disorder. The cultural and entertainment programme aimed at assuring the special children of social support. Adequate awareness on disability-friendly programmes, including job opportunities, equal rights on par with normal persons, and pension benefits were explained, with a view to imbibing confidence among them.",
