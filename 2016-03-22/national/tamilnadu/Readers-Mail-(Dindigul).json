    "text": "Divert traffic\n\nFor the past several years, there has been a demand for the construction of a rail over bridge across the level crossing near Tiruthangal rainway station. Due to the absence of an over bridge, vehicular traffic is held up for a long time on both sides of the level crossing. One-way traffic system should be adopted from 8.00 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. on this road. Buses, lorries and heavy vehicles should be diverted at Indian Kaka Foundry through Lions Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Pallapatti Road, Alamarathupatti Road railway crossings and Tiruthangal bus stand.\n\nSNMT Nagarajan,\n\nSivakasi.\n\nFix nominal cost\n\nThe district branches of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society have honoured eight organisations and educational institutions. The private blood banks, after getting blood free of cost form the donors, are selling it to the needy patients at an exorbitant amount of more than Rs. 1000. There is no justification in collecting a huge amount from patients after getting blood free of cost. I request the district branch of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society to take into consideration the pathetic condition of patients and take necessary action to fix a nominal amount for blood to be collected by private blood banks.\n\nG. Nagasamy,\n\nRamanathapuram.",
