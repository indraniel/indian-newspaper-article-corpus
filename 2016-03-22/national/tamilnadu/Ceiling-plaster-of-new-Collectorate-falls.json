    "text": "A portion of the ceiling plaster fell at the main portico of the new collectorate building here on Sunday night.\n\nThe portion of the ceiling plaster that fell off its perch was on the ramp meant for use by people with disabilities at the main portico of the new building.\n\nSince it came off at night and that too on a public holiday was a bit fortunate as anything of that sort on a busy day when many people throng the complex for submitting petitions and processing pleas would have caused considerable damage.\n\nThe incident occurred around 8 p.m. and promptly the security staff informed the officials.\n\nImmediately, the PWD (Buildings) officials were apprised of the situation and they rushed some masons and assistants along with requisite material to take up patch work on the ceiling plaster portion measuring around six square feet that came off in the dead of night.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the incident occurred just nine months after the new collectorate complex was declared open.\n\nChief Minister Jayalalithaa had declared open the new buildings in June last.",
