    "text": "Anna University is likely to issue application forms for admission to BE/BTech courses for the academic year 2016-17 by mid-April. University sources said the decision would hinge on how soon approval from the All India Council for Technical Education is received by affiliated colleges. With the State going to the polls on May 16, engineering aspirants could have a tough time purchasing or submitting forms. The university is traditionally one of the counting centres and comes under a blanket of security cover till counting is completed. The counting of votes would take place on May 19. Admission to engineering colleges affiliated to the university is a long process, with a month-long counselling being conducted for candidates to fill up around 2.80 lakh seats. Every year, the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) application forms are issued a few days ahead of the publication of class XII results to enable students to finish formalities such as getting the relevant community, nativity and income certificates. The university also takes into consideration processes such as revaluation and re-totalling that takes around a fortnight.\n\nFor the university too, it is a tedious process as it has to make elaborate preparations. Since thousands of parents and sometimes families throng the university during counselling, it seeks police support to prevent touts from luring away gullible aspirants to unrecognised colleges. Sources said that a final decision on the date of issue of forms is expected by the first week of April.",
