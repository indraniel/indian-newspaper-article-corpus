    "text": "Weather blogger Pradeep John notes that though places like Salem and Vellore experience soaring temperatures in March, the mercury has hit the 40-degree Celsius mark early this year owing to hot air blowing from the land.\n\nHowever, experts say there is a possibility of showers in southern Tamil Nadu by the end of this month.\n\nThough the change in wind pattern from cool easterlies to westerlies occurs only in April, such brief episodes happen in March too, observe weather experts.\n\nY. E. A. Raj, former deputy director general of meteorology, noted that increase in temperature levels also depends on the length of day time and the angle of sun rays during March.\n\n\u201cCoastal areas like Chennai have an edge over the interior parts like Vellore and Karur as sea breeze provides respite from rising temperatures,\u201d he said. Coimbatore will get a respite from heat in May thanks to the cool winds from the Western Ghats, he added.",
