The incident took place around 8 p.m.\n\nThese children were playing in front of the portion of the building that crumbled.\n\n\u201cWe were chatting with our friends and a few children were playing in front of the building. Some people on the opposite side of the lane shouted to us that the building was falling. We immediately dragged the children along with us,\u201d said 32-year-old T. Magendran, a tenant. Over 50 years old, the building has eight tenants. Each family shares around 200 sq.ft. of space as their rented accommodation. There are deep cracks on the ceilings, walls of the building.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, a portion of the ceiling collapsed. Luckily, no one was injured then too,\u201d said 65-year-old I. Malathi. Residents blamed poor maintenance of the building for the accident. The building, they said, belonged to Gunasekar, a smalltime artist in films and a resident of Sowcarpet. The immediate cause, residents said, might be the demolition of another old building adjacent to the existing dilapidated building as both buildings were supporting each other. No case has been registered by the Vepery police.",
