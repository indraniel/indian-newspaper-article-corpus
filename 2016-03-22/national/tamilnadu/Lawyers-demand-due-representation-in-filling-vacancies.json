Paramasivam, chairman of Federation of Bar Associations of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, said that 41 vacancies of judges at Madras High Court were lying vacant. It is said that appointments to six posts were finalised recently and 30 posts were vacant. Of these, 19 posts would be filled by selection made from lawyers in Madras High Court while 11 posts would be filled by selection made from senior judges in district courts. \u201cWe have been demanding that one third of the vacancies be filled through giving opportunities to qualified lawyers in district courts,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Paramasivam said that resolutions were passed in the federation\u2019s general body meeting held on February 27 at Chengalpattu and they also boycotted court proceedings on March 7. \u201cWe had even sent the resolutions and also presented them personally to the Chief Justice and Registrar many times,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the 30 candidates recommended for filling of judges vacancies did not have adequate representation of the lawyers, he added. Hence, demanding one-third of the representation to lawyers practising in district courts, the federation would boycott courts on March 24.",
