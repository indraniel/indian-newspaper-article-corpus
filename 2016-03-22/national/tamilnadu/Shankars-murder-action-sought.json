    "text": "Aathi Tamizhar Peravai on Monday staged a protest near the Coimbatore South Taluk Office demanding that all those responsible for the murder of Dalit engineering student V. Shankar in Udumalpet a few days ago, be arrested.\n\nDistrict secretary N. Murugan said that of the 83 honour killings in the State, Shankar\u2019s was the goriest because the incident happened in broad daylight in a crowded place. Even before people could get over the shock, those responsible for Shankar\u2019s death had issued death threats to his younger brother.\n\nThe letter had sent shockwaves among Shankar\u2019s family members, said Mr. Murugan and sought action under the provisions of The SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities Act), 1989 against those responsible for Shankar\u2019s murder.\n\nThe police should include as accused all those who Shankar\u2019s widow Kausalya named, and action should be taken against officials who failed to act on Shankar\u2019s petition seeking protection.\n\nThe State Government should go to the rescue of Kausalya who was traumatised. She had no support at present. The government should, therefore, take steps to provide her a secured future.",
