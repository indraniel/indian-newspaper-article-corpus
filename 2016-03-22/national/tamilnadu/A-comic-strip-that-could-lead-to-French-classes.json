The cartoonist, Pashupathi Chatterjee, is better known by his pen name Poltu.\n\nHe weaved comic strips to draw people into learning French. His two young characters, Vic and Sid, whose adventure of learning French involves several exciting escapades, were drawing people\u2019s attention. \u201cThe sheer popularity of these characters pushed Alliance Francaise into bringing all these strips together for a full-length comic book, for celebration of the Francophonie,\u201d said Mikael de la Fuente, Director, AF, Bengaluru. The book would be released at Alliance Francaise on March 21, at 6.30 p.m. Free comics will be distributed at the event.\n\nIn 2006, Poltu left his IT world to pursue his passion for cartooning and humour writing. \u201cPoltu is adept at French and is a Francophile,\u201d says Mr. Fuente. \u201cAfter he won an international song writing competition in France, he was in constant interaction with French artists. France has always had a huge tradition with this cartooning gender called the 9th Art. India has a growing market for this sequential art of cartooning that makes sense to us,\u201d he says.\n\nPoltu returned to India last year after his residency at the Alliance fran\u00e7aise de Lyon in France. \u201cDuring my stay, I produced funny little stories on my interactions with employees and students of the Alliance. This is what Alliance in Bengaluru wanted to replicate. It\u2019s for creating French language awareness that students and public can relate to. That\u2019s the journey of this comic,\u201d he says.\n\nNearly 100 strips of cartoons make up this comic \u2018Ici on parle fran\u00e7ais.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe comic book, mainly in French, has English and Kannada words that should inspire Bengalureans into learning French,\u201d says Mr. Fuente.",
