    "text": "Stating that steps should be taken by the management for admitting students for 2016-17, teachers and students of The Salem Cooperative Polytechnic College in Mohanur staged a sit-in protest here on Monday.\n\nThe college was started in 1984-85 and is run by The Salem Cooperative Sugar Mills Limited. The strength of the institution that once stood at over 1,500 had dropped to 300 now due to poor management, the students said.\n\nAccording to the students, the management has taken no efforts for admitting students for 2016-17 and is planning to close the college. \u201cDue to delay in admissions, the strength of the students preferring the institution has dropped over the years. The management is not willing to run the college,\u201d they added.\n\nThe students said that they had urged the management to take steps to admit students, but there was no response from their side. \u201cHence, we were forced to stage protest,\u201d they added.\n\nAbout 60 teachers also joined the protest who said that even the 5{+t}{+h}pay commission was not implemented for them. The teachers said that the life of students and teachers would be affected if the college was closed. Hence, they urged the district administration to take steps so that admissions were conducted in the right time. They continued their sit-in protest near the entrance.",
