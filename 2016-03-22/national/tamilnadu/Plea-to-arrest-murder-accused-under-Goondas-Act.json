    "text": "Accompanied by her five daughters, a farmer, Murugan, whose wife and daughter were murdered by a person recently, submitted a petition to Collector M. Karunakaran on Monday, seeking compensation to the poverty-stricken family and the arrest of the accused under the Goondas Act.\n\nAfter N. Muthuraj (32) alias Andavan of Nettoor allegedly misbehaved with a mentally deranged 28-year-old woman from the same village, the girl\u2019s mother, Petchithai (45), filed a complaint with Alangulam police.\n\nBut the police let him off with a warning.\n\nAgitated over this, Muthuraj allegedly hacked to death Petchithai, her daughter M. Mariammal (20) and Petchithai\u2019s father Govindasamy (80), all farmhands, when they were returning home after the day\u2019s work on February 16. Subsequently, he was arrested.\n\n\u201cSince Muthuraj is already facing several criminal cases and has murdered three innocents in a gruesome manner, the Collector should order his detention under the Goondas Act.\n\nMoreover, the Collector, considering the pathetic condition of my family, should recommend our case to the government for compensation and employment to one of my daughters based on educational qualification,\u201d Mr. Murugan pleaded.\n\nReceiving the petition, Dr. Karunakaran said that the petition would be forwarded to the State government immediately for appropriate action after the completion of the election process.",
