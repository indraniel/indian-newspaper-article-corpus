Panneerselvam have moved the Madras High Court Bench here seeking a direction to a lower court in Tirunelveli district to consider a bail application to be filed by them right on the day of their proposed surrender in a case booked under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.\n\nThe petitioners, R.S. Murugan and V. Kumar, said that the Tirunelveli police had booked a First Information Report against them on the basis of a complaint by one Kumarasamy with whom they had a civil dispute. Stating that they had decided to surrender before Judicial Magistrate-II in Tirunelveli, the duo sought a direction to the Magistrate to consider their bail application on the day of surrender itself.",
