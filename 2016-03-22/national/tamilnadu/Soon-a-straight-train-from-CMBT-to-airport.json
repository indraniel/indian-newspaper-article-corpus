However, with the new plan (extending the Metro route from Alandur to Chennai airport on the Koyambedu line), commuters can have direct access to the airport without having to get down at Alandur.\n\nAccording to sources at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), there is a provision to implement this. \u201cThere is a facility at Alandur station with which a straight trip can be ensured but, there are several factors to be considered before we take a decision,\u201d an official said.\n\nThey said they may implement it after looking at the number of people riding to the Chennai airport after the second stretch from Little Mount becomes operational. Further, they also have to make a survey on the number of passengers headed to Chennai airport from Koyambedu.\n\nFirst service\n\nThe first service from Koyambedu to Alandur, a distance of 10 km was started only in July last year.\n\nFares\n\nThe fares for this stretch range between Rs. 10-40 for general class and double the price for special class.\n\nChennai Metro Rail built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore spreads over 45 km of the city; of this entire stretch, 21 km will be an elevated corridor and the remaining 24 km will be underground.",
