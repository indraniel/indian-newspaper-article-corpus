    "text": "r. Karunanidhi\u2019s statement that he is still hopeful of the DMDK joining forces with the DMK has surprised partymen on both sides. Though this suggests the two parties were still in talks, sources in the DMDK said this was certainly not the case. \u201cWe have no idea why he said that. Our stipulation is we will only include parties that accept our leadership in the alliance. We are pretty sure the DMK won\u2019t accept this demand,\u201d said a senior DMDK leader. The leader added that \u201cmalicious rumours\u201d were being spread that party functionaries were unhappy with the decision to go alone. \u201cThe decision has enthused our cadres, who think the time has come to come out of the shadows of the AIADMK and the DMK,\u201d the leader asserted.\n\nHighly placed sources in the DMK too said an alliance with the DMDK \u201cwas close to impossible\u201d since no talks had taken place between the two parties in the last fortnight.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Karunanidhi\u2019s statement took even DMK district secretaries by surprise. \u201cNobody made any big remark about an alliance with the DMDK in the district secretaries meeting. The leaders too did not say the talks were on. So we do not know why our leader made this remark,\u201d said a district secretary. Some of the district leaders expressed concern that the DMK was being attacked the same way as the ruling AIADMK by the People\u2019s Welfare Front and the PMK, and wanted a strategy to counter the criticism. Observers feel the Mr. Karunanidhi\u2019s statement portrays the DMK as being weak. \u201cThe statement is a double-edged sword. If Mr. Karunanidhi doesn\u2019t succeed in pulling the DMDK in, it will hurt the party\u2019s image. The level to which the DMK has climbed down in seeking the support of the DMDK is, in my view, unprecedented,\u201d said political commentator \u2018Azhi\u2019 Senthilnathan.",
