    "text": "More than 100 private contract workers doing housekeeping, security and sanitation work at Dindigul Government Hospital thronged the office of the Joint Director of Health Services demanding revision of wages for them here on Monday.\n\nThey said that the State government had revised the pay structure for all the workers long ago and private contract firms in other districts revised the pay structure one and a half years ago. No such revision was made in Dindigul district also till date, they alleged.\n\nFor example, wages for a sanitary staff in Karur GH was around Rs.235 per day whereas a worker in Dindigul received just Rs.190 only. Similarly, security staff in other districts received a wage of Rs.280 per day, but we get Rs.240 only, they said.\n\nA total of 112 workers have been taking care of housekeeping, sanitation and security work in Dindigul GH. The private firm refused to revise the wages, charged S. Balamurugan, a housekeeping worker in the Dindigul GH. ESI and PF were deducted from our wages but no receipt was given to us till now, he alleged.",
