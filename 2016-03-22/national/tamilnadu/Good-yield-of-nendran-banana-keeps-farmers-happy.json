The price per bunch has shot up by at least 10 per cent this month over the last month\u2019s returns, say the farmers. The district has about 1,000 acres of area under \u2018nendran\u2019 with a harvest of 1,000 bunches an acre.\n\n\u201cThe price has been fluctuating from time to time depending upon the demand in Kerala where the fruit is readily converted into value-added products in the form of chips and powder,\u201d say the farmers.\n\nHorticulture Department sources say the crop is being raised on well-drained area with fertile soil and Manikandam block had a majority of area under cultivation.\n\nAlthough other varieties are being raised in Musiri, Thottiyam and Lalgudi blocks, it is Manigandam block where the fields are blessed with adequate drainage. The duration of the variety is about one year. Although \u2018poovan\u2019 and other banana varieties could be raised as a ratoon crop, \u2018nendran\u2019 could not be raised on this pattern.",
