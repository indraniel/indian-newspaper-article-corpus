An SUV of V. Dhanasekaran, Vadipatti town secretary of Amma Peravai, was seized on Friday as it had the photograph of party general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. On Sunday, the vehicle of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionary Anitha Paulraj was seized on the same charge.\n\nThe SP said that the photographs and other political messages on the vehicles amounted to campaigning for the party.\n\nHowever, he said that no seizure of vehicle was made for the vehicle sporting party flags, since the election campaign has started. \u201cWe have asked the owners to remove such flags. However, stringent action will be taken against the vehicles if they were found to be campaigning with flags,\u201d he said.\n\nThe district police have so far, seized 1,821 bottles of IMFL, worth Rs. 1.64 lakh, that were sold illegally. Similarly, Rs. 27.24 lakh has been seized from various places for want of proper accounts.
