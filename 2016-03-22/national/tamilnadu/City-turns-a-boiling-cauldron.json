    "text": "Residents say they have a sense of being in May\n\nOn Monday, Chennai seemed to be already in the middle of May, with several parts of the city, especially the suburbs, recording the highest day temperature for the year so far.\n\nGiven the way the Mercury has been behaving, \u2018Hotter, Drier and Wetter\u2019 \u2014 the theme of this year\u2019s World Meteorological Day, observed on March 23, that dwells on rising temperature and climate change \u2014 seems to have been aptly chosen, especially where Chennai is concerned.\n\nThe weather observatory in Meenambakkam registered 36.1 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal and the one in Nungambakkam also recorded 36.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees above average.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s considered normal only when the deviation is by one or two degrees from the normal temperature,\u201d said S. B. Thampi, deputy director general of meteorology, Chennai, adding that changing wind patterns and a clear sky had led to rising mercury level.\n\n\u201cDry weather will continue for two more days. Chennai may get a respite from the searing heat in mid-April as evening showers are likely then. We expect the day temperature to peak beyond 42 degree Celsius in May,\u201d he said.\n\nThe presence of hot westerly wind in the morning hours is cited as a reason for the sizzling heat.\n\nAccording to former deputy director general of meteorology Y.E.A. Raj, although the temperature in Chennai is relatively lower than in the interior parts of the State, the high humidity levels may bring in a sense of discomfort.\n\nHowever, sea breeze provides some respite from the scorching heat.",
