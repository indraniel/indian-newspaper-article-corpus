    "text": "Former Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram seems to have refused to be part of a Congress committee to identify preferred constituencies for the Assembly elections and hold talks with the DMK, ostensibly unwilling to work under TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan.\n\nA release from the party said the eight-member committee includes Mr. Elangovan, former TNCC presidents K.V. Thangkabalu and M. Krishnaswamy, senior leaders D. Yasoda and Su. Thirunavukkarasar.\n\nSources in the party said while the high command wanted to include Mr. Chidambaram in the committee, he declined. The committee is likely to begin talks with the DMK this week.",
