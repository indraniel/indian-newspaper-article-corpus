Anandakrishnan), often referred to as a \u2018living encyclopaedia on Tamil movies,\u2019 died here on Monday after a brief illness. He was 89 and is survived by wife Sivagami, two sons \u2014 \u2018Diamond\u2019 Babu (a Public Relations Officer in the film industry) and Ravi \u2014 and two daughters, Geetha and Vijaya.\n\nPassionate about photography, Anandan started his career as a freelance photographer with Film News , which gave him the moniker \u2018Film News\u2019 Anandan. He slowly slipped into the role of a film historian after he started jotting down salient details of the happenings at a film shoot. Anandan went on to become a colossus in film history.\n\nA lesser-known aspect of his career is that he was also one of the most successful public relations personnel in the film industry when the profession was still at a nascent stage. He worked as a PR person for over 3,000 films. \u201cIt was thanks to M.G. Ramachandran that I entered that field. Beginning with Nadodi Mannan , I took care of the public relations of all his films till the very end,\u201d he was quoted as saying in an interview to The Hindu .\n\n\u2018Film News\u2019 Anandan was a warehouse of memory, says film director and script writer Chithralaya Gopu.\n\n\u201cNone of us in our film unit, including director Sridhar, bothered to archive our creations, but Anandan used to do the job, even without our knowledge. I was then driving a Vespa scooter and my house was in Triplicane. Anandan lived on Peters Road in Royapettah and everyday he insisted that I pick him up to the sets and drop him back. He utilised this travel time to raise a volley of questions about our movies and personal lives. I did not realise then that he was recording our lives and then, all of Kollywood looked to him for information. He saved whatever remained, like a treasure hunter, and could provide information about movies, which had been packed away in dusty old boxes for years...\u201d said Mr. Gopu.\n\nNo wonder then that everyone from the Tamil film industry has sent their condolences to his family, including Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi.\n\nHe recently published a phenomenal and extensive work on film history, a collection of data that he had gathered from over 16,000 feature films in different languages. Anandan provided clarity and perspective for many generations of film journalists until his death.\n\nThrough his long career, Anandan had a ringside view of the evolution of technology in Tamil cinema and how film audiences understand the craft in cinema. \u201cThe layman of today knows much more about camera angles, editing and art than he did earlier,\u201d he said in an interview to The Hindu . Those who have had the good fortune of speaking to him attest to his incredible memory and strong sense of humour.\n\nSpecial Correspondent adds:\n\nChief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday condoled the death of film historian \u2018Film News\u2019 Anandan. \u201cWhen he worked as the PRO of the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce he began his collection and later that turned into a passion. His collection of archival material was huge. This led to his receiving several awards, including the Kalapeetam, Kalaichelvam and Kalaimamani awards,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa said.\n\nIn 2002, her government had provided Rs. 10 lakh to procure and protect the material.",
