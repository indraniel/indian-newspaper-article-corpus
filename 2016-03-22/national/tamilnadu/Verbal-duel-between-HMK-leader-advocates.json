    "text": "The Combined Court complex here witnessed some tense moments for some time on Monday after the Hindu Makkal Katchi leader Arjun Sampath made certain remarks against Periyar and his ideals within the court campus infuriating a group of advocates. The heated exchanges that reportedly broke out between a section of advocates and the HMK members prompted the intervention of the police.\n\nHe wanted to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate court in connection with a case booked against him by the Srirangam police for damaging a statue of Periyar near the Rajagopuram of Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam in December 2006.\n\nArjun Sampath who has been named as one of the accused in the case came along with another HMK member Raghavan, also an accused in the same case. After the case was posted for next hearing, he and few others came out and reportedly raised slogans. Later, he interacted with reporters when he made certain remarks against Periyar, C.N. Annadurai and the Dravidar Kazhagam conference held in Tiruchi on Sunday. The remarks apparently infuriated a group of lawyers who took strong objection to them.\n\nMr. Arjun Sampath\u2019s car was reportedly blocked when he was about to leave leading to heated exchanges between the HMK members and the advocates. A team of police rushed and held talks with both groups separately to maintain order.\n\nPolice sources said the Sessions Court police received separate complaints from both sides seeking necessary action. The sources said the police were inquiring into the complaints.",
