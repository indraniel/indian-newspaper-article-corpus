    "text": "A group of senior advocates here has urged the Chief Justice of India and Chief Justice of the Madras High Court not to accede to the reported request of some judges of the High Court to transfer them citing casteism and groupism.\n\nSenior advocates R. Krishnamoorthy, V.T. Gopalan, K. Doraisamy, K. Srinivasan, R. Muthukumarasamy, S. Parthasarathy, V. Prakash, P. Wilson, M.S. Krishnan, A.R.L. Sundaresan and over 50 other advocates met Madras High Court Chief Justice S.K. Kaul on Monday and submitted a representation in this regard.\n\nThe lawyers said that Justices R. Sudhakar and V. Ramasubramanian, who have reportedly sought a transfer, have rendered landmark judgments touching several branches of law.\n\nAdmitting that they are aware that the two judges were criticised \u201cunjustifiably\u201d for taking action against a section of erring advocates, the signatories to the memorandum said, \u201cSome fringe elements, who have no stake in the Bar, in a bid to gain publicity, played the caste card and engaged in unsavoury mudslinging.\u201d If the two judges who are alive to the local needs of the Bar as well as the litigants are transferred, it would lead to a void and be disastrous to the institution, the advocates added.\n\nCopies of the representation were also forwarded to the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of Law and Justice.",
