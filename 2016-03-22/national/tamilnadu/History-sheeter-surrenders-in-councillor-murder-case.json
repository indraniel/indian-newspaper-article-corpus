Manipandi and an unnamed accused in the murder that took place on Munichalai Road.\n\nThe deceased, representing ward 51 of Madurai Corporation was attacked by a gang and he sustained multiple stab injuries. He died on the way to the government hospital.\n\nAfter the post-mortem, the body was handed over to the family members on Monday.\n\nThe police said that the brothers who had been supporting Vijayaraghavan in the ward, were disgruntled of late over the councillor not favouring them in getting some benefits through Corporation shops.\n\nThe police said that only after interrogating the surrendered accused and arresting others, they could establish the real motive for the murder.\n\nBased on a complaint by Vijayaraghavan\u2019s father Krishnamoorthy (64), Teppakulam police have registered a case of murder.",
