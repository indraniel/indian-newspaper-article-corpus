    "text": "The protest followed an alleged attack on a conservancy inspector by a ward councillor\n\nHundreds of Greater Chennai Corporation's conservancy workers struck work in Zone 15 in Sholinganallur on Monday demanding legal action against S. Kannan, a ward councillor, for assaulting a conservancy inspector of that zone. A police complaint has been filed against him. Conservancy work was affected in all the nine wards.\n\nThe conservancy vehicles which were parked inside the zonal office did not move out till late in the day as workers gathered in front of the office shouting slogans against what they termed the \u201cCorporation\u2019s ineffectiveness in providing congenial work atmosphere for workers, who are responsible for keeping the city clean.\u201d Workers alleged that K. Ramadoss, a conservancy inspector, was roughed up by the councillor following an argument that erupted when the former instructed the workers to wear uniform jackets while on work. \u201cHe (the councillor) objected to this and he pushed me aside by using foul language,\u201d said Mr. Ramadoss.\n\n\u201cThose doing conservancy work need to be respected. This is not the first time a worker is being abused/assaulted by ruling party members,\u201d said P. Srinivasulu, general secretary of Chennai Corporation Red Flag Union.\n\nWhile workers demanded an audience with the zonal commissioner, the meeting did not take place. They subsequently met some junior-level officials, but with no conclusion. The union has resolved to carry its protest through the night if no solution is found by Monday evening. Mr. Kannan could not be reached for comment. Police negotiated with them, informing them that legal action will be taken against the councillor based on their complaint.",
