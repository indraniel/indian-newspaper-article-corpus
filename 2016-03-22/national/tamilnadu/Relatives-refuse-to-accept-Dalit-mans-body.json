    "text": "While relatives of Chinnasamy (55) of Nallampatti, a Dalit, who, they alleged, had been murdered by upper caste people, have been refusing to accept his body after post-mortem at the Government Hospital, Coimbatore, since Sunday demanding appropriate action, on Monday, representatives of the community refused to meet an official team that had invited them for talks to sort out the issue.\n\nSuperintendent of Police M.R. Sibi Chakravarthy, District Revenue Officer R. Satheesh, and other senior police and revenue officials returned after waiting for about four hours at the Nallampatti Town Panchayat office.\n\nThe relatives alleged that the official machinery was siding with the alleged perpetrators of the crime. They insisted that Chinnasamy had been murdered and pushed into the well on Saturday night, as a fall out of a problem caused by registration of a case under PCR (Protection of Civil Rights) Act at the Thingalur station a fortnight ago.\n\nThe Thingalur police had registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances. The stand of the police Department is that the cause of death could be determined based on the post-mortem report.\n\nMeanwhile, about 25 youth belonging to Tamil Puligal, an outfit representing Arundathiyar sect, were arrested when they attempted to block the road in front of the Post Office in the city calling for an end to the killing of Dalits in the State.\n\nThe youth demanded stringent action against those responsible for the death of Chinnasamy, and called upon the Police Department to deal with PCR Act in all seriousness.",
