The major attractions are: water melons available for Rs. 18 to Rs. 20 a kg; tender coconuts at Rs. 25; sugarcane juice at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 (depending on the size of glass); ice-apples at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20; and cucumbers Rs. 10 for a packet containing two pieces. The major concern of citizens is the quality of water used in preparing juices, and cleanliness.\n\n\u2013 Photos: S. Siva Saravanan, and M. Periasamy",
