    "text": "Disenchanted with the ruling All India NR Congress (AINRC) over the delay in deciding a poll strategy, M. Vaithianathan, the sitting MLA and Parliamentary Secretary to Chief Minister, went into a huddle with his supporters to take stock of the political situation.\n\nMr. Vaithianathan, AINRC MLA is represents the Lawspet constituency. During the last Assembly polls, Mr. Vaithianathan defeated V. P. Sivakozhunthu by a margin of 5,432 votes.\n\nAccording to supporters, Mr. Vaithianathan has served the people in his constituency well and put in strenuous work for the last six years. He can virtually identify everyone in the constituency.\n\nHe has frequently undertaken door-to-door visits when the people were in the need of any assistance from him.\n\nIt is reliably learnt that Mr. Vaithianathan has been sore with the Chief Minister and the AINRC president N. Rangasamy\u2019s discreet sanction to sitting DMK MLA Nandha T. Saravanan to go around the constituency projecting himself as the AINRC candidate.\n\nEven as the Opposition candidate Mr. Sivakozhunthu has rolled out his campaign in the constituency, Mr. Vaithianathan can only sit and watch as his party is yet to determine candidates.\n\nA confidante of Mr. Vaithianathan said, \u201cHe has convened a meeting of supporters and the people in the constituency to chalk out a plan irrespective of the party line. It is certain that he will contest in Lawspet constituency.\u201d\n\nIn another development that could hurt the ruling party, the sitting AINRC MLA P. Angalane who resigned the primary membership of the party is likely to join the Congress party, sources added.\n\n\u2018He will contest from Lawspet irrespective of whether he gets AINRC seat or not\u2019",
