    "text": "Farmers, affiliated to All India Kissan Sabha (AIKS), petitioned District Collector asking the administration to direct banks not to forcefully get back the agriculture loans disbursed.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the administration to get the entire agriculture loans obtained from the commercial and cooperative banks waived in due course of time as the farmers in the district are facing lots of operational issues. The price realisation for produces are poor, and the yield low,\u201d said S. Chinnasamy, district president of AIKS.\n\nThe farmers in the district had procured crop loans, term loans for farm mechanisation and land development, loans for allied activities like cattle and sheep rearing and dairy ventures, among others.\n\nBank officials, however, said that a blanket waiver of all loans would have a cascading effect on the monetary situation, including the fiscal deficit.\n\nS. Dhananjayan, a chartered accountant, was of the opinion that instead of waiving loans, the government should try to make agriculture a viable option.\n\n\u201cThis can be made possible by investing in irrigation and farm mechanisation, and help farmers adopt modern technologies,\u201d he said.",
