    "text": "In view of the Chithirai festival of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple from April 9 to 25, trade and business establishments along Vittavaasal, Amman Sannidhi Street and Masi streets have been advised to erect summer pandals above 30 feet in height.\n\nIn a press release, the Executive Officer of the temple, N. Natarajan, said that pandals over 30 feet in height would facilitate smooth procession of deities during the festival. Festoons should be displayed in such a manner as not to disturb the procession. The Tamil Nadu Hindu Temple Protection Committee has appealed to the civic body to immediately relay the roads along which deities would be taken in procession during the Chithirai festival. In a resolution passed at its meeting held here recently, the committee insisted that there should not be any hindrance for voluntary organisations in opening stalls to offer butter milk and cool drinks for devotees during the festival.",
