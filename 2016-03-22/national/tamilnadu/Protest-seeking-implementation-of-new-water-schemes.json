Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nDemanding implementation of Thanadiyur \u2013 Moolakadu water scheme and Cauvery \u2013 Sarabanga river scheme, members of Cauvery Surplus Water Action Committee staged a demonstration near the Collectorate here on Monday.\n\nThe members said that surplus water from Stanley Reservoir in Mettur Dam was let into the sea every year through the 16-vent Ellis Saddle surplus channel.\n\nBut farmers in the district were unable to get water for agriculture needs and drought prevailed every year.\n\nSurvey\n\nThey said that the State Government had announced a Rs. 1,300-crore water scheme to benefit farmers in the district through which the Cauvery would be interlinked with Sarabanga River. The government had also allotted Rs. 50 lakh for survey works. But, no works were carried out.\n\nThey said that by implementing the Thanadiyur \u2013 Moolakadu scheme, water could be pumped and taken through the natural passage and interlink the Cauvery and the Sarabanga. Also, water from Sarabanga River in Omalur can be taken to mix with River Thirumanimutharu.\n\n\u201cThese schemes helps in distribution of natural resources and remove regional imbalance,\u201d they added.\n\nMinister for Highways and Minor Ports Edappadi K. Palaniswami during his election campaign in 2011 promised to implement the water schemes after coming to power. Also, the then PWD Minister Duraimurugan in 2007 assured them to implement the scheme. \u201cBut none of the politicians took any steps for implementing the schemes,\u201d they added.\n\nThe members said that over one lakh agriculture lands would receive water regularly besides recharging of groundwater level in villages across the area.",
