    "text": "The Greater Chennai Corporation has started exploring various technology options for treating sewage to improve water supply for parks. \u201cWater supply for parks remains a challenge. We are planning to set up a sewage treatment facility near every park. The treated water will be used for the parks,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe previous proposal for commissioning sewage treatment facilities inside parks was rejected due to restrictions on the use of OSR land for construction activity. Following a study, the civic body is expected to commission small sewage treatment facilities after the polls. During summer, parks are expected to face water shortage. Last summer, many parks received inadequate water supply and the civic body received a number of complaints from residents.\n\n\u2014 Special Correspondent",
