Karthikeyan\n\nWith a huge arrival of shallot from major onion production centres in Dindigul and nearby districts, the wholesale onion market in Dindigul has witnessed a crash in prices of small onion, worrying farmers. Onion growers could not get even 10 per cent of their seed costs as returns and many of them would be forced to switch over to other crops in the next season, traders said.\n\nThe prices of shallots that hovered around Rs.18 a kg last month suddenly fell to Rs.7 a kg on Monday. On the retail market, shallots were being sold up to Rs.15 a kg. Regular arrival from Theni, Andipatti, Dharapuram and Udumalpet was good owing to high yield, small onion traders said.\n\nThe market received 4,100 bags of shallots (each weighing 60 kg) on Monday, of which the arrival from domestic production centres, especially Iyyalur, Eriyode and Gujiliamparai, was around 2,500 bags, said V. Rajendran, onion wholesale trader.\n\nWith no exports in the last one month, prices fell sharply. Already, Sri Lanka has started cultivating onion to reduce imports, traders added.\n\n\u201cI purchased onion seeds at Rs.70 a kg. But, shallots were sold for Rs.7 a kg in the market. Selling price of small onions did not cover even 10 per cent of the seed costs. How can I meet other expenses such as input costs, plucking and freight charges,\u201d asked R. Balakrishnan, a farmer in Iyyalur.\n\nHuge arrival of shallot from major onion production centres in Dindigul and nearby districts cited",
