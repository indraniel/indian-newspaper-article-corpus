They create a ruckus and some of them even throw up inside the bus shelter,\u201d said a trader in Sembakkam, pointing out to the daily harassment. Commuters at Kamarajapuram and Mahalakshmi Nagar said they would always think twice before visiting shops near these outlets, fearing unruly behaviour by liquor consumers.\n\nSelaiyur residents said drunk people sit in groups outside a shop near 100 feet road. They throw and break empty glass bottles.\n\nTASMAC officials said they take objections from residents around their outlets into consideration. They get plenty of requests to shift certain shops, but there is a delay in shifting some of them as it is not easy to locate an alternative location. Nearly 40 outlets were closed in the last two years, they added.",
