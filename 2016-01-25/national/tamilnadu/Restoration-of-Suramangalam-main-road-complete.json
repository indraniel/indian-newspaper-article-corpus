Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nThe State Highways Department completed the work of restoration / renovation of the Suramangalam main road and a stretch of three roads, following the completion of the laying of pipelines and Tangedco cable wire recently.\n\nThe road restoration work was undertaken from Three Roads junction to Tiruvagoundanur roundabout; and the Suramangalam main road stretch from Tiruvagoundanur up to Uzhavar Santhai.\n\nThe white marking is yet to be done on the renovated road.\n\nThe white marking will give a new look to the entire stretch, local residents say.\n\nOnly about six months ago the State Highways Department gave a facelift to the Suramangalam main road, a busy main thoroughfare by widening and relaying the road.\n\nWithin months, the Corporation dug one side of the road for laying pipeline and the Tangedco later for laying cable, which forced the highways to undertake renovation work again.\n\nThe Highways Department is also involved in the restoration work of the road stretch from Ammapettai upto Holy Cross School in Udayapatti, which too was damaged for laying drinking water pipeline.\n\nThe Highways sources said that the department will soon take up the restoration work on the stretch of the road from Hasthampatti roundabout up to the Superintendent of Police Bungalow and also the Shevvapet main road after the completion of the underground drainage work.",
