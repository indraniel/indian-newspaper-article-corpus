Siva Saravanan\n\nFor 20-year-old Arvind from Erode, making Panchaloha idols is a skill that he learnt from his parents and has been doing it for more than a decade now.\n\nHe was in the city on Saturday, with his friend Venkatesh, aged 21, to take part in the Gen Next competition organised by Poompuhar.\n\nCoimbatore was one of the centres for the contest this year and 18 participants, all aged below 30, displayed their skills in handicrafts (paper quilling, stone carving, glass painting, making panchaloha idols, jewellery, clay dolls, and making products from coconut shells).\n\nAccording to R. Narendra Bose, manager of the Poompuhar outlet here, the contest is held in Mamallapuram, Chennai, Tiruchi, Kumbakonam and Coimbatore this year.\n\nThe aim is to encourage the younger generation to develop their skills and interest in handicrafts.\n\nSelection\n\nPhotographs of the work of all the participants will be sent to Chennai for selection. From Coimbatore, 10 participants will be selected. They will get a certificate, cash prize of Rs. 2000 each and a medal.\n\nThey had three hours time to complete the work and were permitted to do some of the preparatory works at home so that they could complete the product at the venue.\n\nFor contestants such as Arvind and Karuppuswamy (who was from Thirumuruganpoondi and was into stone carving), their family members were also involved in making the products.\n\nFor some others, they had learnt to make products (such as wealth out of waste) because of their interest. Poompuhar had been conducting the contest every year and even college students can take part, he said.",
