    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Friday expressed dismay over a nationalised insurance company vehemently resisting payment of a claim for angioplasty under a medical insurance cover for a maximum of Rs. 50,000 just because the claimant had undergone the medical procedure within nine months of taking the insurance policy.\n\nThe First Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice V. Ramasubramanian dismissed a writ appeal preferred by National Insurance Company in 2014 challenging an order passed by a single judge of the High Court in 2013 to settle the claim made by S. Abdul Shakoor of Thoothukudi in 2007 after spending Rs. 90,000 towards hospital bills.\n\nContending that the claimant must have been suffering from coronary complications even before taking the insurance policy, the appellant company pointed out that clause 4.1 of the policy categorically stated that pre-existing diseases would not be covered under the policy. It heavily relied upon a statement in the discharge summary that the claimant was suffering from breathlessness for past three years.\n\nHowever, refusing to accept its contentions, the judges pointed out that the same discharge summary issued on February 7, 2007 also stated that the patient had been suffering from chest pain only for past four days.\n\nHence, they held that the company could not deny the claim by citing clause 4.1 which excluded pre-existing diseases from coverage under the policy.",
