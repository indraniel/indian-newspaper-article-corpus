Vedhan\n\nCrowds continued to visit the Chennai Pongal Book festival at YMCA Grounds in Royapettah on Sunday and as organisers announced that event will be extended for two more days, the joy of book lovers knew no bounds.\n\nAmong the visitors to the festival, K. Sudhakar of Padur said he had been motivating people living in his village and the surrounding areas to visit the book festival.\n\n\u201cWe were able to arrange buses on weekends and during Pongal to help people attend the festival. Many people, who live far away from the city, are either unaware of this event or find it difficult to get here,\u201d he said.\n\nRising interest\n\nMore than 70 people from the area visited the book fair on Sunday. \u201cThere is now a definite increase in interest in reading among youngsters and we are happy about this. Educational institutions from Nagapattinam and Kumbakonam are among those who visited the fair to buy books for their libraries,\u201d said K. Nagarajan from Bharathi Publishers.\n\nOn Sunday, ten authors were honoured for their contribution to Tamil literature: S. Madasamy, Manushyaputhiran, Eknath, S. Arshiya, Bhagiyam Shankar, P.N.S. Pandian, S. Devadas, Satheesh Muthu, Priya Thambi and Pavanan.\n\nR.S. Shanmugham, trustee of Tamil Nadu Book Sales and Promotions Association, said they had recorded a footfall of nearly 2 lakh.\n\n\u201cTamil books, which detail history and heritage as well as biographies of public figures, are popular among youth as well as families. Children\u2019s books in both Tamil and English are popular too,\u201d he said.",
