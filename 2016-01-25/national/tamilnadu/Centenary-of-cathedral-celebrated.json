Duraisami, a press release said.\n\nThe British-built church, originally the Garrison church for British soldiers in Black Town, was handed over to the Orthodox Church in October 1916. It was the core of the first congregation of the Orthodox Syrian Christian community outside of Kerala. There is a significant number of Orthodox Syrian Christians who have made Chennai their home.",
