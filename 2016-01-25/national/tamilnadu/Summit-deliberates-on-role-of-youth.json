Commuters in Chennai, where the ridesharing option was introduced recently, are observing the development with great interest.\n\nAnand Subramanian, senior director, Marketing Communications at Ola, said the option of carpooling on the Ola app was an extension of the ridesharing facility.\n\nIt allows users to create a custom list by simply adding friends with their mobile phone numbers. This helps CarPool users travel with their identified friends. Similarly, car owners can also choose to share their ride with anyone outside of their friends. Mr. Anand said: \u201cAll of Ola\u2019s safety features including Track your Ride, Share Ride Details, 24-hour customer care support, SOS, emergency contacts and In-trip feedback are available on CarPool as well.\u201d\n\nUsers in Chennai hope the carpooling option will be introduced here as well.\n\n(Reporting by S.
