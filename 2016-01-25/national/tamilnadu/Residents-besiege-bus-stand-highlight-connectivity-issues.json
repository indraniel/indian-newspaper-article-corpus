They claimed that despite such protests, the government has not taken any remedial action.\n\n\u201cWe stopped the buses from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. It is the administration that is forcing us to protest in this manner,\u201d said A. Murugan, a fisherman from Pazhaverkadu. According to the residents, there are over 80,000 people living in Pazhaverkadu and in 50 hamlets nearby, including Kottai Kuppam and Light House.\n\n\u201cPazhaverkadu is the main bus stop for us and most of the residents come here to board buses to Chennai or Ponneri, which is 19 km away and has the taluk office.\n\nA few years ago, there used to be many buses, but over the past five years, their numbers have declined considerably.\n\n\u201cThere are no buses during rush hour. Due to this, students are struggling. They are not able to reach school or return home on time. Besides, many fishermen are also put to great hardship on account of this,\u201d said Durai Mahendran, general secretary, Tiruvallur Maavatta Paarambariya Aikiya Meenavar Sangam.\n\nHe said the residents had been asking for a bus terminus in the locality for the last several years.\n\n\u201cChildren are not able to come home on time and study. They get tired waiting for their bus. A few years ago, the government promised a bus service from Pazhaverkadu to Parrys. But they are yet to make good their promise,\u201d he added.\n\nThey prevented buses from entering\n\nor exiting Pazhaverkadu stand",
