Of these, Aarthi\u2019s talk on memories and Kishore\u2019s speech on lessons from life engaged the audience\u2019s attention for the clear communication of their ideas. Subhash\u2019s speech on the Siachen Glacier was thought-provoking.\n\nSukanya\u2019s realistic enactment of cooking her favourite recipe earned much applause while Anuradha\u2019s visually-aided speech on natural disasters was declared to be informative.\n\nAll speakers were encouraged to make ample use of the word of the day \u201castounding\u201d.\n\nClub president Sasi led the proceedings. The general evaluator for the evening was Toastmaster Rathnakumar, assisted by a timer, \u2018ah\u2019 counter, and grammarian (TAG) team of Toastmasters Bathool, Leo, and Sherin respectively.\n\nTiruchi Toastmasters Club is affiliated to Toastmasters International, based in California, U.S. Besides this, a chartered (officially recognised by the parent organisation) club is functioning at Bharathidasan Institute of Management (BIM) and two more are to be launched shortly at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchi, and M.A.M. College of Engineering and Technology.\n\nThere are more than 3,32,000 members of Toastmasters in 15,400 clubs across 135 countries.",
