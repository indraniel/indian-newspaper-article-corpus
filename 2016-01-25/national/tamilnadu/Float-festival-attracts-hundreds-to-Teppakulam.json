    "text": "Decorated float wafted its way on green water on the 22-acre tank\n\nThe joy and grandeur associated with the 12-day teppam festival of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple here returned on Sunday as the decorated float wafted its way on clean and green water on the 22-acre tank, a major tourist attraction of the temple city. The festival is held every year on the day of Poosam, the birth star of King Tirumalai Nayak, in the Tamil month of Thai.\n\nLast year, the water was at a lower level and the earlier two years saw a 'nilai teppam' (static float) on a dry tank. This year, water has been filled in the tank much earlier to a depth of about nine feet. As per convention, Devendrakula Velalar youth from nearby Anuppanadi pulled the float around the central mandapam of the tank using nylon ropes, twice in the morning and once in the night.\n\nEarlier in the day, Lord Sundareswarar and Goddess Meenakshi were taken in a procession through the Chithirai streets, East Masi Street, Yanaikkal, Nelpettai and Kamarajar Road to Muktheeswarar Temple near Teppakulam. After pujas, the deities were taken to the float which ambulated around the central mandapam in its first round around 11.30 a.m.\n\nHundreds of devotees assembled along the tank parapet to worship the deities, which were clearly visible from a distance. Traffic flow on the Kamarajar Road and the roads around Teppakulam was smooth.\n\nAs the sun set in the evening, the area came to life with a riot of colours under a full moon. Devotees swarmed all roads around the tank as the Teppakulam turned into an arena of an annual fair. Traffic was diverted to facilitate smooth movement of pedestrians. The deities returned to the temple late in the night.",
