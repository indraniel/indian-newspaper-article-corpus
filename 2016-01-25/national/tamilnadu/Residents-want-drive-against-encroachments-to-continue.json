    "text": "A number of reasons, including paucity of funds and inadequate coordination among government departments, have brought the drive against encroachments on lakes around Tambaram to a halt.\n\nSources in the Water Resources Department (WRD) told The Hindu that they needed funds to hire earthmoving equipment and engage workers to bring down the encroachments. They also needed police protection as long as the drive lasted, in addition to support from other government departments.\n\nThey explained that the Revenue Department should primarily give their sanction for going ahead with removing the encroachments. At the same time, they also needed support from Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to relocate the power supply installations, including junction boxes and transformers. Without such steps, they were unable to proceed with the drive, officials said.\n\nResidents pointed out that while unauthorised structures in Perungalathur, Mannivakkam, Varadharajapuram and Mudichur were brought down, a handful of them that had encroached on Rajakilpakkam and Sembakkam Lakes were spared. Officials, however, said that the drive against encroachments would continue as per their plan made after the December floods. They had demarcated the areas that had to be cleared and had even installed warning boards in the respective lakes and other water channels, they said.\n\n\u201cA group of people are now on the rounds, demanding money from gullible people, informing them that they will obtain a court stay and stop the demolition drive. The government should not stop and should continue the drive against encroachments if lakes here have to be protected from the land mafia,\u201d said Rajesh Vaidhyanathan, a resident of Selaiyur.",
