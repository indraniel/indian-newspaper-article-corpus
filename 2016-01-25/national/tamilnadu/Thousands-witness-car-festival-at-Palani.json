Amid chanting of hymns, the idols of Lord Muthukumaraswamy and Goddesses Valli and Deivanai were given a ritualistic bath in the river and taken back to the temple. Then, special pujas were conducted.\n\nAfter the pujas, the aesthetically decorated idols were mounted on the car at an auspicious time between 11 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. Special pujas and aradhanas were performed to the deities on the car.\n\nWith \u201cArohara\u201d renting the air, devotees drew the holy car along the four Car streets. As the temple elephant has gone to the rejuvenation camp for elephants, the temple administration roped in volunteers and temple staff to pull the holy car from its base. The celestial wedding took place in the temple between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on Saturday. The 10-day festival will conclude with the float festival on Wednesday.\n\nHindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister R. Kamaraj, Collector T.N. Hariharan and HR &CE Joint Commissioner P.
