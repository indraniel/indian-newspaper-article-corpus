People have been asked to send their suggestions to mygov.in \u2013 an online portal launched by the Centre for people\u2019s participation.\n\nActivists and office-bearers of civic groups in the city have for a long time been demanding an increase in the train services and drastic improvements in the quality of amenities in railway stations. For instance, the Traffic and Transportation Forum has asked for doubling of Chennai \u2013 Madurai \u2013 Nagercoil sector along with electrification.\n\nThe Forum also wants the railway administration to give greater attention to \u201cenvironment engineering\u201d \u2013 increasing green cover in stations and importance to aesthetics.
