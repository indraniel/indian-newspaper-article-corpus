    "text": "Residents of Surya Nagar in Kotturpuram on Sunday resisted attempts by Chennai Corporation to evict and relocate them to Semmenchery.\n\nOfficials wanted to evict many families living along banks of the Adyar river, but due to the stiff resistance, the officials put off the move, said G. Selva of Communist Party of India (Marxist). \u201cWe resisted and prevented the families from being sent out as their livelihood will be affected if they are relocated. People who have shifted there are complaining about the problems they face on a daily basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf people have to be relocated, it has to be within a three-kilometre radius and not outside the city limits. How can students in class X and Plus Two cope up, with public examinations just a few weeks away,\u201d he asked.\n\nM. Senthil Kumar, a resident of Surya Nagar, said his family had been living here for four generations and he would not leave.\n\n\u201cMy children study in Kotturpuram and it is neither possible to travel 25 km every day nor can we afford to spend on the commute, he said. Chennai Corporation said it was planning to arrange more special buses for school students who had been relocated.",
