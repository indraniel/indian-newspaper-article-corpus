VEDHAN\n\nEvery student who came for re-allotment of seats to the Government Siddha Medical College in Arumbakkam on Wednesday had a number of stories to tell about the erstwhile Kallakurichi-based SVS Medical College of Yoga and Naturopathy.\n\nFollowing the death of three second-year students of the college, who allegedly committed suicide on January 23, the students approached the government demanding alternative arrangements.\n\nBased on the registration details with the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University, letters were sent out to 136 students, requesting them to come for re-allotment.\n\nFive students from the 2008 batch, three from the 2009 batch and 30 from the 2010 batch came for re-allotment. While two from the 2008 batch had finished the course, the rest are yet to complete the mandatory internship.\n\nA student of the 2008 batch S. Nihaluddin said: \u201cOn my first day at the college when I saw it had no building I returned home to Chennai. Later, I tried to get bank loans but was denied. All I want is my certificates so that I can pursue a degree through correspondence.\u201d\n\nAnother student from the same batch said he used to work as a mason, carpenter and as a watchman in the college as part of his internship. \u201cI want the degree certificate. I have studied theory, but for practicals I came to Chennai and the students here helped me. I need the certificate to join a clinic as an assistant,\u201d he said. Of the eight students in his batch only five had continued the course.\n\nNirupen Babu of 2010 batch had attempted suicide after he was forced to give in writing that he did not have enough attendance in college.\n\nHe wanted to discontinue, as his father R. Vedhayan could not afford the fees. Despite petitions to the medical university his appeal was ignored, he said.\n\nR. Krishnaveni, mother of Hemavathi of 2015-16 batch, said in November they tried to complain to the Commissioner. The family was asked to submit a petition to the medical university and the registrar Jhansi Charles.\n\nAll students have paid five to six times the government-prescribed fees for each year. At least 20 students, who said they were directly admitted under management category this academic year, said they had paid Rs. 1.88 lakh to Rs. 2.45 lakh, but the college did not issue any receipt. \u201cOur children\u2019s certificates are in the college and it has been sealed. We want it back,\u201d said a parent.\n\nEven as the re-allotment was in progress, agitated parents surrounded a 2008 batch student Kodeeswari, who, they said, was always seen with Vasuki Subramanian, chairman of SVS College.\n\nWhen parents questioned her role as accountant in the college, she maintained that her certificates were also confiscated like the other students and she was only following instructions.\n\nKodeeswari has been permitted to pursue her internship at the government college in Arumbakkam.\n\nAn official said counselling for all candidates who had come on Wednesday was completed.\n\nAs for students under the management category, if they remained enrolled and the details are available in the college, they would be accommodated.\n\nAnother official said 24 students who were sent letters did not appear for counselling. All those who are willing would be accommodated whenever they come, the official added.",
