Chopra, president of the Cardiology Society of India.\n\nInaugurating the three-day annual conference here on Wednesday, Dr. Chopra said the best way to tackle the current crisis was to take the digital route.\n\nHe suggested that a smart app on how to prevent heart attacks and how to reduce hypertension be created.\n\nAccording to him, the specialists should create a road map to make prevention their motto.\n\nBy 2025, the Society should aim at reducing the cardiovascukar disease mortality by 25 per cent, he said.\n\nHis suggestion to cardiologists was to spend time with patients telling them about healthy lifestyle and exercise.\n\nPratap C. Reddy, founder chairman of Apollo group of hospitals said cardiologists should work with the 5,00,000 general physicians in the country to raise awareness about the seriousness of cardiac diseases that cut life short.\n\nIf cardiologists, the civil society and the government did not act soon, cardiac ailments could grow by 15 to 20 per cent by 2020, he warned.\n\nThe Society honoured two cardiologists with life-time achievement awards and released three books on cardiac care.",
