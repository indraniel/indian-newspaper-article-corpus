    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has dismissed a batch of three writ petitions filed by an accused challenging the Constitutional validity of Sections 5 and 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 from which the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) derives the power to investigate various types of cases across the country.\n\nAll the three petitions had been filed by N.S. Ganeswaran who was facing as many as three corruption cases investigated by the CBI. In his affidavit, the petitioner had urged the High Court to resolve a conflict between two Supreme Court decisions over the use of the definition of \u2018State,\u2019 as found in the General Clauses Act 1897, to interpret the Constitution.\n\nHowever, wondering how could a High Court resolve a conflict between two decisions of the Supreme Court, a Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran said: \u201cWe do not know how we are competent to do so? All that we can do is to provide a ticket on \u2018tatkal\u2019 to the petitioner to enable him to take the case to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nFurther, pointing out that the Supreme Court had already upheld the validity of the two legal provisions which had been challenged by the petitioner at present, the Division Bench said that the apex court had also upheld the right of the High Courts in every State to order a CBI probe in appropriate cases even without obtaining the consent of the respective State government.",
