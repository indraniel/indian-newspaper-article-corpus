It aired the best of the NBA games on the big screen much to everybody\u2019s surprise. And, the crowd roared in joy to see their all-time greats in Michael Jordan and Lebron James dazzle like never before.\n\nIt did the raise energy levels of the players. And, they pushed that extra bit to finish on top. To further up their spirit, JASA had some special dance treats between points. This is probably the first time that a tournament of any stature in this part of the region is witnessing such a visual treat. It was, without doubt, a spectacular show of skill, grit and sportsmanship by both the performers and the players.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen something like this before,\u201d said G. Selvaraj, president, Coimbatore District Basketball Association (CDBBA).\n\n\u201cWe may now have to take extra efforts to further raise the level of our show when we conduct the all India basketball tournament for the Nachimuthu Gounder Cup in May this year,\u201d he added.\n\nR. Syril Irudhayaraj, the CDBBA secretary, was quick to back his statement.\n\nBaboo Vivekandaon, JASA\u2019s founder and secretary, was a happy man too. He was obviously thrilled with the bouquets showered on the conduct of the tournament from various quarters. He called it team work.\n\nThe tournament, which included the big boys for the first time, saw a new winner in SRM University (Chennai). And, the took home the V.R. Kumaravel Memorial Trophy. Assumption College (Changanaserry, Kerala) wrested the Jayalakshmi Memorial Trophy for women.\n\nThe late Kumaravel\u2019s family members Nirmala Kumaravel, Prem, Vikram Senthil and Maragadha Lakshmi gave away the awards.",
