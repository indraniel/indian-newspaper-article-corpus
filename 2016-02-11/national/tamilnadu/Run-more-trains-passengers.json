    "text": "The continued under utilisation of the Salem \u2013 Namakkal \u2013 Karur sectionis a matter of concern for the commuters of not only the western districts, but also those of central and southern districts. At present only three pairs of passenger trains, including one pair of temporary service, are being operated between Salem and Karur during the whole day. There is no night time connectivity. Palani \u2013 Chennai Central and Nagercoil \u2013 Bengaluru overnight services are the only regular express trains on this section. The yet another express train Nagercoil \u2013 Kacheguda express train being run on this section is a weekly train. Various commuters associations have been regularly pleading for the introduction of more trains on this section. The Salem Railway Users Forum has pointed out that at present Salem is not directly connected to Rameswaram, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Kanyakumari and Tiruchi during the day time. The forum has demanded the extension of Salem \u2013 Karur passenger to Tiruchi; the Tiruchi \u2013 Karur passenger to Salem. The forum has also demanded the extension of Tirunelveli \u2013 Erode passenger and the Tiruchi \u2013 Erode passenger to Salem.",
