Krishnaswamy\n\nThe trial run for the next stretch of the Chennai Metro Rail service between Little Mount and Chennai airport may start early next month.\n\nThis trial run is crucial, as after it is adequately carried out, the stretch can be thrown open for public use, which is expected to happen six months from now.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), though the trial run between Little Mount and Nanganallur Road had started in November, it was stopped owing to some technical problems.\n\nBut, they plan to now conduct the trial run on this stretch and extend it up to Chennai airport too.\n\n\u201cAlso, we will carry out the trial run beyond Alandur to the next station, St. Thomas Mount. We will soon finish the technical work required before carrying out the trial run and start early next month,\u201d he added.\n\nThe work on stations along Little Mount to Chennai airport is in full swing and expected to be completed soon, he added.\n\nSoon after the trial run is over, the officials will invite the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRL) for inspection and only after the clearance is given can operations commence from Little Mount to Chennai airport. The same procedure will be followed for extension up to St. Thomas Mount. The first service of Chennai Metro Rail between Koyambedu and Alandur was launched only in July.\n\nIn Chennai Metro Rail, being built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, only 10 km between Koyambedu and Alandur has become operational.\n\nAfter the trial, the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety will inspect the stretch",
