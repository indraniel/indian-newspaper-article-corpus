Sometimes even professional artists come up to ask me how I get the photographic depth in my portraits.\u201d\n\nThe play of light and shadow is achieved with the skilled use of negative space on white board, he added. \u201cYou have to be very careful when you work with monochrome, because mistakes show up very clearly in black and white,\u201d said Balaji.\n\nThe son of farmer parents in Thiruvaiyaru, Balaji said his earliest ambition was to learn classical music and become a singer. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get any support at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I realised that I had a talent for drawing, so I shifted my goal towards formally learning art.\u201d\n\nHaving done his Masters degree from the Government College of Fine Arts, Kumbakonam, Balaji spent over 12 years working as a 3-D animator for an IT major in Hyderabad. \u201cBut it distanced me from art,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI used to make human figures on the computer, after which other teams would add the bone structure, movement and so on. It was an artist\u2019s work, but with far too many technicalities. I never got the time to draw for myself when I was working.\u201d\n\nHit by the slump in the IT industry in 2009, Balaji held out for another two years before deciding to return home and, in a way, to his first love. \u201cFor the past two years, I\u2019ve decided to focus on Carnatic musicians, because as far as I can see, nobody has specialised in this genre,\u201d said Balaji. \u201cAnd since Thiruvaiyaru is known as the cradle of Carnatic music, I can now indulge my love for both art and music through these portraits.\u201d\n\nBalaji finds it easier to draw male singers because they usually don\u2019t wear elaborate ensembles when performing. A portrait of singer Sudha Raghunathan took him six days to complete because of the intricate designs on her silk sari, he added.\n\nFrom K.J. Yesudas, M.L. Vasanthakumari, Bombay Jayshree, Mahathi and so on, the artist reckons he has only been able to portray 20 major Carnatic artistes in a list of at least 70 leading figures in the field. \u201cI\u2019m making trying to do it chronologically, and diversify into portraying music composers as well. Portraits of M. S. Subbulakshmi are always very popular, and I\u2019ve sold at least five of them since I started out.\u201d Balaji\u2019s drawings are priced in the range of Rs. 9,000 to Rs. 12,000.\n\nBalaji hopes to pass on his passion for drawing to the younger generation by becoming an art teacher while remaining an artist. \u201cI want to use my art education to the maximum,\u201d he concluded.\n\nFor the past two years, I\u2019ve decided to focus on Carnatic musicians because as far as I can see, nobody has specialised in this genre\u201d",
