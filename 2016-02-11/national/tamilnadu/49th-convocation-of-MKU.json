There are as many as 11 hostel blocks on the campus. The students complained that by introducing new norms under the guise of delivering transparency in administration, the authorities took their own time even to provide fans and lights. After about six hours, Registrar (in charge) Muthumanickam visited them and assured to look into their grievances within a week, following which the hostellers withdrew their stir.",
