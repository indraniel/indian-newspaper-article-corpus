Venkatesh, Managing Director, Co-Optex told The Hindu during his recent visit to Tirunelveli.\n\nApart from this, the Co-Optex has also revived the \u2018three parts\u2019 pattern, temple border, mango designs, all inseparable constituents of vintage silk saris, now to attract even the younger generation owing to the reduced weight.\n\n\u201cAs the younger generation want to wear only lightweight saris, we started using thread work instead of \u2018zari\u2019 in the silk saris. Besides reducing the weight, this approach also has brought down the selling price of these saris. This classical combination has in fact triggered a kind of wave among the buyers. Hence, all these saris are selling like hot cakes to take the revenue of Co-Optex to Rs. 208 crore in 2015 from Rs. 196 crore in the previous year,\u201d Mr. Venkatesh said.\n\nThough this idea has yielded desirable results, the efforts taken by Co-Optex for achieving this feat is really laudable. Since it has showrooms in northern India also, it worked with National Institute of Design to give a kind of \u2018pan-India appeal\u2019 to its vintage products to attract the customers of northern parts of the country also.\n\n\u201cBesides incorporating aesthetical vintage characters in our saris, we also integrated silk embroidery in our saris to take the products to next level,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen unprecedented flood submerged four northern districts, demand for blankets being marketed by Co-Optex increased manifold as it became the first choice for the philanthropists, Mr. Venkatesh said.\n\n\u201cWe started using thread\n\nwork instead of zari\u201d",
