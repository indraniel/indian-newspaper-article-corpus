    "text": "Solemnising the marriage of 14 couples at YMCA Grounds in Royapettah, AIADMK general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa narrated a story about a politician-father and his son, who wanted to learn the nuances of politics from the former.\n\n\u201cHowever, the father did not teach him and told him to learn it on his own. He said, \u2018in politics there is no father or son, each one has to survive on his own.\u2019 When the son insisted that he teach him, the father asked him to climb up a ladder and go to the loft where he had written down the various acts of deception he had used to stay on in politics. However, the son did not get an opportunity to read the books as the father withdrew his support to the ladder and the son fell down. This was the first lesson he learnt in politics. The father then gave his son a long rope, but eventually reined him in. I narrated the story only to show how dangerous politics is and if you connect it to someone, I am not responsible for that,\u201d she said amidst thunderous applause from the audience.\n\nEarlier, in his welcome address Mr. Vaithilingam said that the AIADMK will rout the DMK in the elections.",
