    "text": "Health authorities of Pudukottai district on Wednesday said that no patient had lost vision over the last one year in the district because of cataract surgical inaccuracies or incompetence.\n\nParimala Devi, Dean, Government Medical College Hospital, Pudukottai, told The Hindu that there was absolutely no truth in the reports that four persons had lost vision because of surgical failure.\n\nActing on reports, the Project Director of State Blind Control Society, Dr. Revathy had visited Pudukottai about two weeks ago and conducted enquiry with the medical officials, paramedical staff, ophthalmologist assistants, and the patients concerned. She found that they had not lost vision and had 50 per cent vision after the surgery.\n\nThe enquiry report had given clean chit to the ophthalmologist concerned. Moreover, the patients had not lodged any complaint either against the doctor or the hospital.",
