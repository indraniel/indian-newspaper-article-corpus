    "text": "The Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (TEAMA), formed by micro, small and medium scale textile enterprises, has called upon the different associations and forums in Tirupur knitwear cluster to show unity while representing the issues to Government.\n\n\u201cIt was sad to see different sets of exporters representing the same cluster (Tirupur cluster) giving separate set of representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while he has been on a recent visit to Coimbatore. This has been the same for the past many years with the associations and forums making individual representations be it before budget or during the talks with Union and State Ministers. The Ministers and other officials actually will lose the respect for the cluster due to this, even though they might be receptive and courteous to all factions\u201d, pointed out TEAMA president M. P. Muthurathinam.\n\nThe micro and small scale entrepreneurs were of the view that all associations, shedding the egos, should sit together and come out with a roadmap on the issues that actually needed government intervention instead of highlighting only the needs of tax and duty exemption in every front.",
