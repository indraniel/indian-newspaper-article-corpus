Udayakumar has condemned \u201cstep-motherly attitude\u201d of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the Tamil Nadu fishermen issue and \u201cdouble game\u201d played by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on several burning issues, including the GAIL pipeline project.\n\nEven after the death of 700 Tamil Nadu fishermen, the Centre was not paying due attention to the issue. The State government should stage a protest in Delhi and put an end to the fishermen issue, he said.\n\nThe State government had failed to protect the Cauvery delta farmers. The Chief Minster was satisfied with mere writing letters to the Centre on several burning issues.\n\nBoth the AIAMDK and the DMK had been playing double game on Gail pipeline and methane projects. They granted approval to the projects and opposed them when election neared. If one of these political parties was elected again, there would not be any sand left in rivers of the State.\n\nThe State needed a political alternative to prevent sand mining, protect natural wealth and ensure a better future to next generation. Almost, all waterbodies had become sand quarries in the State. It should be viewed as betraying the future generations, he said.\n\nInspecting Aranmanaikulam, he said that the condition of the tank was very pathetic. With no proper maintenance, it had become a waste dump.\n\nHe voiced his concern against as plan to construct a bus stand in the Aranmanaikulam area \u201cas it will wipe out groundwater source and pave way for depletion of groundwater table.\u201d The proposed bus stand was a short term plan. It would have short term benefit only, he added.",
