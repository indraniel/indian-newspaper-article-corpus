    "text": "Staff of Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority placed a multi-storey building under lock and seal in Sowcarpet for violating the original planning permit given to it. A press release said the owner had received permission in 2010 to construct a stilt plus two floors for an office-cum-residential building with 3 homes on Mint Street.\n\nHowever, the owner had constructed a commercial complex with ground and mezzanine and three additional floors.\n\nThe building had 61 shops and 6 homes. As the unauthorised building was in violation of the planning permit given by the Chennai Corporation, they issued notices as early as in 2013. As the owner did not comply to other warnings issued later, they placed the building under lock and seal, the press release added. The building was placed under lock and seal as per provisions of Section 56 and 57 of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971.\n\nFurther, caution and de-occupation notices were issued in 2015 and earlier this year.",
