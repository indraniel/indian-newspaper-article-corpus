The actual erection of new span could be done in a month\u2019s time, he said.\n\nThe lesser weight new span could be opened in a minute, just by the press of a button to allow more vessels to pass through, he said. The new span would also facilitate operation of 26 bogie trains on the bridge to Rameswaram island, five bogies more, he said.",
