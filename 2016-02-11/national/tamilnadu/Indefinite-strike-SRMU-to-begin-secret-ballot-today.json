    "text": "Southern Railway Mazdoor Union on Thursday will begin three-day secret ballot seeking permission from the railway employees for an indefinite strike proposed from April 11, its president C.A. Raja Sridhar said.\n\nThe secret ballot will be held in all the railway stations and other railway premises.\n\nMr. Sridhar said that the entire railway personnel were disappointed with the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations that had reduced several allowances and fixed the minimum wage at Rs. 18,000 a month when the demand was for Rs. 26,000 based on the internationally accepted Dr. Aykroyd formula, he said.\n\nSimilarly, the house rent allowance has been brought down. Demand for five promotional chances to railway men through their career was turned down. Increasing the income tax exemption to Rs. 5 lakh, as promised by the Bhartiya Janata Party during the Lok Sabha election, was also not implemented.\n\nStating that the Centre was not showing any interest to hold negotiations with the employees, Mr. Sridhar said that various Central Government employees\u2019 bodies have decided to go on indefinite strike from April 11.\n\nSRMU would also oppose the move for increased privatisation of the railway and downsizing of its workforce.\n\nDivisional secretary J. M. Rafiq was present.",
