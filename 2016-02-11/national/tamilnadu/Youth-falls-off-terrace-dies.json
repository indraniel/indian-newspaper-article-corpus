The deceased has been identified as Raju Bhardwaj, a native of Chattisgarh. Police said that Raju was poor in studies and wanted to discontinue it. However, Raju was under pressure from his family to continue with his studies. According to the police, Raju ran away from home and came to Bengaluru six months ago. He was working in the city as a house keeper in Rajeshwari Guest House. Raju was staying in the third floor of the guest house with other staff.\n\nA few days ago, Raju\u2019s family managed to trace him and sent his elder brother \u2014Sanjay Bhardwaj \u2014 to pacify him and get him back home. On Monday night, Sanjay came to the city and forced his brother to pack his bags. The duo was supposed to return home on Tuesday.

The hotel staff rushed Raju to KC General Hospital, where he later succumbed.\n\nThe Upparpet police have registered a case.",
