    "text": "Since its launch ten months ago, the Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) mobile app has registered a steady albeit slow growth as shown by the number of people that have been using this facility to book their suburban tickets.\n\nIn May last, 9,732 platform tickets were booked daily through the mobile app. In October, it rose to nearly 34,000. After this, the progress has been considerably slow.\n\nLast month, it was about 42,000. As far as season tickets go, nearly 2,000 commuters on all suburban sectors had booked their season tickets through this mobile app this month.Users point out that fine-tuning the app and simplifying the procedures for booking tickets would make recharging easier, therefore attracting more commuters, say users.\n\nCommuters attribute a host of factors to the slow progress being made by the mobile app.\n\n\u201cWhen I use the UTS app on the Tambaram-Chengalpattu line, it works. When I use it on MRTS, I face GPS issues,\u201d said Venkat Raman, a commuter. Stating that booking tickets through the app was an \u2018awesome experience,\u2019\n\nSarvesh Anand, however, said there should have been provisions for recharging the \u2018wallet\u2019 (account balance) online, as otherwise the commuters would have to once again stand in a queue to recharge it.\n\nA common complaint of commuters is issues with GPS and also the distance \u2014 users have to be 25 metres away from the railway line at the time of making the ticket booking.",
