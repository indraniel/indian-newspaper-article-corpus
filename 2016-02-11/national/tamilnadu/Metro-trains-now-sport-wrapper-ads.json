More such advertisements may be seen on other trains too.\n\nOf the 42 trains for Chennai Metro Rail, nine are currently running along the stretch from Koyambedu to Alandur.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they had given a contract to a firm for putting up advertisements at stations and trains along the corridor from Koyambedu to Alandur.\n\n\u201cThe space at stations will also be looked at by the firm and advertisements will be put up at the stations,\u201d an official said.\n\nChennai Metro Rail had already started commercial exploitation of space at its stations by having food joints at some of them, including Alandur station, to attract more commuters.\n\nImproving traffic\n\n\u201cInitially, we have to take these initiatives like having advertisements and eateries in stations to get more revenue as the passenger traffic is not much now on this limited stretch. Such steps will also play a great role in improving the traffic,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe first service of Chennai Metro Rail between Koyambedu and Alandur, a distance of 10 km, was launched only in July.\n\nCurrently, the average passenger traffic on this stretch is about 12,000 a day.\n\nOfficials said such steps were taken to raise revenue as passenger traffic was not high yet",
