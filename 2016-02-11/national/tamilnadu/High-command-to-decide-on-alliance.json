Elangovan told reporters at the Coimbatore airport on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Elangovan came down heavily upon the ruling AIADMK government saying \u201cit was a sticker rule\u201d.\n\nThe partymen had gone to the extent of pasting their leader Jayalalithaa's picture on the forehead of bride and bride grooms, he said, referring to a mass wedding held recently in Udumalpet, where AIADMK men had given head gear with Ms.Jayalalithaa's picture to the bride and groom.\n\nThe Left party-led Makkal Nala Kootani was more a 'B' team of the ruling AIADMK than an independent front, he said.\n\nThe party's national spokesperson Kushboo, who was also at the airport, told press persons a little later that senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad would be in Chennai on February 12 to hold talks with various parties on forming an alliance.\n\nE.V.K.S. Elangovan slammed the AIADMK regime and termed it\n\n'a sticker rule'",
