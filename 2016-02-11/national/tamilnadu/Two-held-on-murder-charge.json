Residency, a few days ago.\n\nThe police said that after recovering the dog-eaten body of Pugazhendi and sending it for post-mortem on Monday last, they inquired Maheswari, who had lodged a complaint. During the course of investigation they had learnt that she had conspired with Prasanth, with whom she had an illicit affair, to finish off Pugazhendi, who had questioned the relationship.\n\nMaheswari had developed intimacy with Prasanth whom she knew while working at a construction site, off Trichy Road. She was a house keeping staff and Prasanth was a welder.\n\nOn Sunday night, Pugazhendi had called Prasanth over phone asking for money to buy liquor.\n\nThe police said that the two knew one another and on several occasions in the past, the latter had sponsored Pugazhendi\u2019s drink.\n\nThat evening, Prasanth bought liquor for Pugazhendi from a shop in Sowripalayam. Thereafter, the two moved towards a vacant spot in G.V. Residency, where after finishing off the bottle, Prasanth called up Maheswari and as decided murdered Pugazhendi by slitting his throat.\n\nHe then left the place, said the police adding that the oozing blood attracted the community dogs that tore into and ate his thigh and toes.",
