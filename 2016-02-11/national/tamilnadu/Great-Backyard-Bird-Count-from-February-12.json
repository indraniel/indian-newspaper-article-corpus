    "text": "The fourth edition of Great Backyard Bird Count\u2014India (GBBC) will take place from February 12 to 15.\n\nThe four-day global event is to create an annual snapshot of the distribution and abundance of birds.\n\nThe data gathered can provide the first sign that individual species may be increasing or declining from year to year. Data gathered over many years help understand whether a species\u2019 range is expanding or shrinking.\n\nA big change, noted consistently over a period of years, is an indication that something is happening in the environment that is affecting the birds and that should receive attention.\n\nThe information thus gathered gives an idea about the kind of birds in different areas, such as cities and suburbs or more natural habitats.\n\nAll one has to do is to watch birds for at least 15 minutes from wherever backyard, park, lake or any place of one\u2019s choice and estimate the number of individual species spotted during the particular time.\n\nPictures should be uploaded to ebird.org/india. Education institutions and others can register for Campus Bird Count to document the birds of their campus.\n\nCertificates will be sent to all registered participants.\n\nTo register your institution for the Campus Bird Count, visit www.birdcount.in or contact State coordinator at phone: 90033-59400.",
