Police personnel were deployed in large numbers on the spot to prevent any untoward incident.\n\n\u201cWe do not accept this decision. Many families will lose their livelihoods. Education of many students will be affected. Many residents have been staying in this locality for over 40 years after acquiring property,\u201d said Shanti, a resident.\n\n\u201cSeveral of us are going for jobs as helpers at industrial units in Pallavaram and Nagalkeni and many of the women depend on the income from housekeeping jobs. We cannot afford to lose this income. We have asked the officials to reconstruct new houses for us in the same locality. We cannot shift to any area that is far away from this place,\u201d she said.\n\nThe protesting residents were pacified by revenue and police officials, who asked them to give a petition to the District Collector.",
