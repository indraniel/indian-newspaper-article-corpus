    "text": "A large number of retired staff from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation staged a demonstration in front of the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) depot, demanding the government to settle their retirement benefits without any delay.\n\nAfter serving the Corporation for almost three decades, when the employees were deprived of their mandatory benefits, it pained them, they said and added that by denying settlement benefits on time, their last source of livelihood, they had been led to the brink of despair.\n\nRepeated reminders to settle the dues to employees on superannuation had not yielded any desired result as the officials at the Corporation maintained that fund crunch was the main reason for delayed settlement.\n\nWhen employees in other government departments were given their dues on the day of retirement, the TNSTC management should also adopt such fair treatment to its retiring employees.\n\nMoreover, the TNSTC, unlike other departments, contributed to the revenue for the exchequer by way of remitting taxes and tolls.\n\nAbove all, the Corporation issued free bus passes to eligible students across the State, which worked out to a whopping Rs. 1,500 crore per annum.\n\nThus the judiciary should give a direction to the government to spell out its policy. The State government should exempt TNSTC from paying taxes on goods purchased such as tyres, tubes, lubricants and diesel. Similarly, toll collected on four-lane national highways from the State-run corporation buses should also be waived.",
