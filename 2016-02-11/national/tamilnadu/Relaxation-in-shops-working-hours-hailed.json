Heera, who works for a major IT firm in the city, welcomes the idea. \u201cMany times I stay at work till 1 a.m. or later, and when I\u2019m going home almost nothing is open...sometimes I stop at either a 5-star hotel or a small roadside eatery for a bite. It would be nice if there was something in between...if the malls or restaurants were open, it would be very helpful not only for me, but also for everyone who works odd hours,\u201d he said.\n\nR. Srinivasan of the Tamil Nadu Hotels Association said the removal of restrictions on the number of working hours would help increase sales, bring in more employment, improve safety in cities since there would be people on the roads at all times and earn more taxes to the government. \u201cAlready in Coimbatore, shops in railway stations and bus terminuses are open 24 hours. Similarly in Madurai, restaurants are open,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nPresident of the Multiplex Association of Tamil Nadu, Abirami Ramanathan, who welcomed the move, said that in countries like Singapore and Malaysia shops were open through the night. \u201cThe move will engage stop gap tourists\u2026 encourage impulsive buying leading to an increase in trade. It will attract more tourists and shopping malls,\u201d he said.\n\nA. M.Vikramaraja, president, Tamil Nadu Federation of Traders\u2019 Associations, said the removal of restrictions would mean shops could remain open until the time they choose to.\n\nOn the suggestion that banks too would be open through the night, S. Nagarajan, General Secretary, All India Bank Officers Association said that as long as officers did not have to work beyond seven hours banks could remain open. \u201cThose along Rajiv Gandhi Salai, the IT Corridor, or those linked to international stock exchanges can be open,\u201d he added.",
