The policy can\u2019t be a replica of other states. It has to be a unique policy pertaining to Tamil Nadu,\u201d said State Industries Secretary, C.V. Sankar, at the sidelines of the second edition of Startupreneurs 2016, a conference for startup companies and budding entrepreneurs, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).\n\nDelivering his inaugural address, Mr. Sankar said that entrepreneurship is embedded in the culture of Tamil Nadu and it is manifest in several towns like Sivakasi (printing), Tirupur (knitting) and Ambur (leather clusters) and others.\n\nGopal Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director, TVS Capital Funds Limited, told entrepreneurs, \u201cBuild whatever business you enjoy doing and be really good at it. Do not worry about valuation nor worry about failure. Even if you fail be flexible and graceful.\u201d\n\nArun Jain, Chairman and Managing Director, Intellect Design Arena Ltd, said that entrepreneurship was a 15-year journey, a persistent and sustained journey. The focus of CII Startupreneurs 2016 was to create a platform for start-ups, potential investors and venture capitalists.\n\nThere were more than 250 participants and more than 85 startups showcased their products.\n\nAnand P Surana, Chairman, CII Startupreneurs 2016, said there were thousands of individuals who required guidance and that was the whole idea of organising this event. \u201cEntrepreneurs are the change agents and they make things happen,\u201d he added.",
