    "text": "The SNS junior athletic meet that made a quiet start five years ago has now grown in stature. It attracted over 5500 boys and girls from various schools in and around the city for its fifth edition which concluded at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.\n\nIt only goes to show that the meet is welcomed by all as it provides the right platform for students from all background level.\n\nThere were all age group athletes from Government, Corporation, Matriculation, Anglo Indian and CBSE schools taking part in the two-day event. It did push the level of competition but they did not mind it.\n\nThe SNS Group of Institutions, the organisers of the show, were definitely pleased with the kind of growth. \u201cIt is the effort of our team and that of the Kovai Athletic Club. We will continue to do more in our journey,\u201d said Nalin Vimalkumar, Technical Director, SNS Institutions, Coimbatore.\n\nThis year, the organisers also made it a point to recognise the physical education staffers who had played a major role in moulding these stars and shoring their team for the overall championship in this meet over the years. They were felicitated on the opening day of the event.\n\n\u201cThere are many meets that I have participated but this is the only one that has honoured us,\u201d said M. Sivakumar, Physical Director, CRR MHSS, Ondipudur.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in my ten-year career that we have been appreciated and felicitated for our efforts,\u201d said T. Arul, Physical Director, GKD MHSS.\n\n\u201cRecognition apart, this meet helps us identify talents. We would be pleased if the organisers include other disciplines as well,\u201d pointed out P. Mohan, Physical Director, SSVM World School.\n\n\u201cBy doing this, the SNS Group has set a benchmark for other colleges,\u201d said R. Velmathi, Physical Directress, Sri Avinashilingam HSS.\n\n\u201cAny individual talent without proper grooming cannot become stars. There might be a few exceptions here and there but I believe the core strength lies in the teaching community,\u201d said Mr. Nalin.\n\n\u201cOnce we start to appreciate them and give a pat on their back they are likely to give something more,\u201d he added.\n\nHe promised that the journey from here will be only bigger and better.",
