Already, five such camps have been held.\n\nShortly, in partnership with SFSF, the Association will establish a \u2018house of birth,\u2019 which will be a full-fledged centre for performing deliveries and providing post-partum care.\n\nThe centre will be adequately staffed and operational round-the-clock. It will also have ambulances to transport women from their homes for delivery.\n\nThe project is supported by French agencies such as the EDF Foundation, Rotary Club of Cavaillon, Care Midwife and Sanofi Foundation, she said.\n\nAccording to T.R. Anbazhagan of the Indian Midwives Association, there are several pockets in rural Puducherry and neighbouring districts of Tamil Nadu where pregnant women lack easy access to maternity services.\n\nThis seems to be the case in many areas in the hinterlands untouched by the advances brought about by the National Rural Health Mission. In fact, a 2013 UNICEF-commissioned study had highlighted that there remained serious, persistent gaps in safe delivery capacity at the primary level, especially sub-centres and remote PHCs, despite efforts to decentralise care through the NRHM.\n\nIn particular, the study had called for a national commitment to the creation of a nurse-midwife cadre in addition to addressing gaps in rural health worker availability through reforms and strengthening and diversifying health worker cadres to fill key gaps in preventative, curative, intra natal, and immediate postnatal care.\n\nAnd, not just in India, even in countries like France there is a huge shortfall in qualified birth attendants, says Ms. Wolff.",
