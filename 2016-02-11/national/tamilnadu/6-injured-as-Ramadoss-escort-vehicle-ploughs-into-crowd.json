Kumar\n\nSix persons were injured after the personal escort vehicle of PMK founder S. Ramadoss ploughed into a waiting crowd at a bus stop at Katrampakkam near Kiliyanur on Wednesday evening.\n\nPolice sources said the car bound to Thailapuram from Tindivanam swerved to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the four-lane highway at Katrampakkam. The driver of the car lost control and hit two motorists and ploughed the vehicle into a group of people headed towards Puducherry who were waiting at a bus stop.\n\nTension mounted after locals resorted to a road blockade at Katrampakkam demanding the arrest of the car driver. Protesters were chased away by police to avert a traffic bottleneck.\n\nThe injured have been admitted to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research.\n\nDoctors said the patients were treated for minor injuries with TT injections and painkillers.\n\nFurther investigations are on, police said.",
