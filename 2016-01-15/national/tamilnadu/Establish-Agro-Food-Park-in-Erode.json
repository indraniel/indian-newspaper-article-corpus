Sivanesan said in a letter addressed to the State Industries Minister P. Thangamani.\n\nThanking the State Government for establishing the Spices Board at Erode, Mr. Sivanesan said vegetables and fruits produced in the neighbouring districts could be processed in the proposed facility.\n\nCold storage\n\nEvery taluk must have a cold storage centre, he said. The other demands included a Herbal Park and seed farm for potatoes in Thalavadi, turmeric processing centre in Erode, perfumery in Sathyamangalam and value addition centre for banana at Gobichettipalayam.\n\nA demand for such a facility has already been made to the Union Commerce Ministry by the Erode District Small Industries\u2019 Association (EEDISSIA), for pushing up the status of agriculture sector and transforming progressive farmers into entrepreneurs, through skill orientation on processing and packaging, he said.\n\nThe EEDISSIA had specified that an Agro Food Park was a must for ensuring better price for farm produce, determination of safety and quality, and preservation of the produce.\n\nThe facility, according to the association, will be helpful for farmers to receive guidance right from seed selection to export.\n\nThe EEDISSIA had also sought for Erode a full-fledged centre of Central Food Technological Research Institute.",
