    "text": "A musical drama, \u201cShri Thyagarajar,\u201d a tribute to Tyagabrahmam presented by T.V. Varadarajan, turned out to be a unique offering at the anniversary celebration of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam in Madurai. Varadarajan used the most appropriate kritis under the music direction of \u2018Bombay\u2019 Jayashree, identified authentic costumes and discussed some concepts from the \u2018namasankeertanam\u2019 expert Sri Udayalur Swami and went on to record the voices of many singers, including Jayashree, \u2018Cherthalai\u2019 Ranganatha Sharma and O.S.Arun. Shobana Ravi\u2019s voiceover introduced the play.\n\nTyagaraja\u2019s character is discussed by Narada and Rama who wants the composer to lighten the burdensome lives of people in Kaliyuga through \u2018namasankeertanam.\u2019 The choice of Tyagaraja to live on alms rather than monetise his knowledge creates tension in his family. The play highlights the various highs and lows in the lives of the composer, leading to musical outbursts.\n\nApart from the title song written by Piraisoodan, many kritis such as \u2018Jagadanandakaraka,\u2019 \u2018Shantamu lekha,\u2019 \u2018Manasuloni,\u2019 \u2018Ma Janaki,\u2019 \u2018Sabhapathikku,\u2019 \u2018Ramanee Samanamevaro,\u2019 \u2018Nithi Chaala,\u2019 \u2018Ramabhakthi\u2019 were some of the songs that were played in the background of key scenes from the life of Tyagaraja.Actor Varadarajan played the role with maturity and attempted to recreate the genius of Tyagaraja as a singer, composer and a saintly human being. The other main characters \u2014 Tyagaraja\u2019s devoted wife, feisty daughter, his worldly brother and his wife \u2014 all played their parts well. The coordinated effort of stalwarts from different fields made the play a unique combination of Iyal, Isai and Nadakam.\n\nRAJALAKSHMI PADMANABHAN",
