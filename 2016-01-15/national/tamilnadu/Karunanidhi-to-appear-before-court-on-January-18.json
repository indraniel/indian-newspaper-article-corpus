Karunanidhi on Thursday said that he would appear before the Principal Session Judge in Chennai on January 18 in connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed by the State government against him.\n\nIn a statement here, he said the government had initiated the defamation complaint against him for reproducing an article published by Tamil bi-weekly Ananda Viktan , on November 25, which was critical of the functioning of the Chief Minister.\n\n\u201cThe AIADMK government is resorting to filing defamation complaints to intimidate the opposition and media houses. Ananda Vikatan has already announced that it would face the case filed against it. As far as I am concerned this is one of the many cases filed by the State government,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi said even though his lawyers suggested the idea of getting an interim stay on the defamation proceedings, he told them that he had decided to appear before the court.\n\nGovt. had initiated the defamation complaint for reproducing an article published by Ananda Viktan",
