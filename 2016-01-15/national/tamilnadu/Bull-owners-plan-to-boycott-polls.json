They are also planning to surrender their bulls to the Collector.\n\nMembers of Tamil Nadu Eruthu Vidum Vilaiyaatu Paadhukaapu Sangam, Vellore district, on Thursday submitted a petition to the Collector seeking measures from the State and Central governments to enable conduct of \u201cjallikattu\u201d and other traditional sports like \"eruthu vidum vizha\" (bull race), which is popular in Vellore district.\n\n\"The State government can convene a special session of the Assembly and bring an ordinance on getting the consent of the Governor to pave way for the conduct of jallikattu,\" R. Soundarajan, the association\u2019s president said.\n\nIf the sport is not allowed, the association has threatened to boycott the polls, he said, adding, \"We will surrender our ration cards, voter identity cards and hand over our bulls to the Collector.\"\n\nThere are nearly 750 bull owners in the district. They are rearing close to 2,500 bulls exclusively for the race.\n\nThe bull owners and enthusiasts of \u201ceruthu vidum vizha\u201d will intensify their protests in the coming days, he said.",
