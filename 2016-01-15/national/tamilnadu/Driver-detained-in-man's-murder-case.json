Venkateswarlu, a senior official of a private power transmission company, for questioning.\n\nThe victim, a resident of Kumaran Colony in Vadapalani and a vice-president of Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited, was killed by a two-member gang on Tuesday night, when he was leaving a clinic at Kumaran Colony 3{+r}{+d}Street. Venkateswarlu had stopped at the clinic, near his house, while returning home from his office in Anna Nagar.\n\nA senior police official said that though they were yet to identify the killers, there were reasons to believe that an office-related dispute led to the murder.\n\nPolice said they were trying to find out if there were any conflicts within Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited, a Gujarat-based company in Chennai, while awarding contracts worth several crores of rupees. They were also exploring the possibility of an aggrieved ex-staff, who was expelled from the company, to have carried out the gruesome murder.\n\nPolice also detained the victim\u2019s driver Arumugam of Sankarankovil in Tirunelveli district for further questioning, as they believe he was among the few who knew of Venkateshwarlu\u2019s daily routine.",
