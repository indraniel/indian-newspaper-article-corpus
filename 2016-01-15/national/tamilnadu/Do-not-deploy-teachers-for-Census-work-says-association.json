    "text": "Engaging higher secondary teachers to perform Census duty and those related to linking Aadhaar card with voter cards would affect the studies of the Plus-Two students, said the TamilNadu Higher Secondary Post Graduate Teachers Association. It has demanded that the teachers should not be deployed for these works.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the District Collector, V. Dakshinamoorthy, the association district president A. Ramu said that with Plus-Two examinations and practical examinations fast approaching, teachers were taking effective steps to ensure 100 per cent pass. Teachers were involved in preparatory examinations, training the students for practical and preparing the students mentally to write the examinations. From Wednesday, post graduate teachers are deployed in the work by revenue officials. This affects the students as teachers would not be able to attend the school for many days,\u201d he added. Hence, he urged the administration to immediately relieve the teachers from those work so that they could attend the school and involve in training the students. The petition demanded that a science laboratory be set up in Government Higher Secondary School in Thaneerpandal Palayam as students were forced to undertake their Plus-Two practical examinations in Government Higher Secondary School in Devanankurichi for the last six years.",
