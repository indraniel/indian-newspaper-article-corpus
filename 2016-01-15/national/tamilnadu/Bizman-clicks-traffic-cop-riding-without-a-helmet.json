He took a photograph with his phone camera.\n\nTrouble started when the constable Ramesh \u2013 who is attached to Koramangala traffic station \u2013 noticed Goutham clicking the picture. Ramesh allegedly approached Goutham and told him to delete the photograph. When Goutham refused, Ramesh snatched the bike key and fled. Curious onlookers, who noticed Ramesh's uncouth behaviour, staged an impromptu protest. Soon three patrolling vehicles reached the spot. They bundled the protestors, and took them to Koramangala traffic police station.\n\nThe policemen threatened to book Goutham for public nuisance.\n\nEventually, Goutham was forced to write an apology. The policemen returned the bike key only after deleting the picture from the mobile phone.\n\nPrima facie evidence indicates rude behaviour by the constable\n\nC.K. Baba,\n\nDCP (Traffic East)",
