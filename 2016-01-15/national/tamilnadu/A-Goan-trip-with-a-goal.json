The cars had names such as Road Ninja, The Baggy Greens, Pappa Don, Raging Horn, Indian Drifter, Bollyhood to name a few. Interestingly, they were all driven by foreigners who are on a mission to spread awareness on cancer.\n\nCharity\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charity drive by the Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT), which is based in United Kingdom. The Trust aims to look after young people (13-24 age group) with cancer,\u201d said David Shaw, TCT\u2019s Deputy Director of Services.\n\nHe said there are about 2500 people diagnosed with cancer every year.\n\n\"We want to tell them we care for them and will also be with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a holiday tour but a drive for cancer\u2019s sake. We aim to collect about 60,000 pounds towards this through our adventure drive,\u201d said Peter Lowes, Facilities Manager of the TCT.\n\nThe Rally titled \u2018Dumball It\u2019s a Goa!' started from Chennai on January 10 and will travel through Southern parts of the country before culminating at Goa for an actual holiday bash.\n\n\u201cIt's an eight-day tour with different stopovers. We travel at an average of 10 hours a day and we are really enjoying it. The Indians are so friendly but the traffic volume and the sound of horns is something that cannot be explained. They honk all the time,\u201d said Jared Carr and Mick McCaine another member of the group agreed.\n\nThe Residency Towers was happy to associate with Dumball 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have extended our best services so that more tour companies are able to engage in similar tours with a cause,\u201d said Erine Louis, its General Manager.",
