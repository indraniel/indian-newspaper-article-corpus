    "text": "They stage demonstration in front of PWD office\n\nFarmers have urged the Public Works Department officials to step up release of water from the Kariyakoyil and Aanaimaduvu dams to ensure that the water reached the Pethanayakkanpalayam Reddy dam for the benefit of tail-end farmers.\n\nBoth the dams have filled up, thanks to the recent widespread rainfall experienced by the district in the months of November and December. Following this, the farmers of the ayacut areas of both the dams demanded the release of water for launching farm activities.\n\nThe PWD authorities conceded the demand of the farmers and opened the shutters of the dam on January 8 for farm activities in more than 1,100 acres under the canal irrigation system in the blocks of Pethanayakkanpalayam and Vazhappadi.\n\nAbout 108 cusecs of water was being released from Kariyakoyil dam situated in Pappanayakkanpatti village into River Vasishtanadhi for the initial 10 days and about 90 cusecs from the Aanaimaduvu dam into the river for 11 days situated in Puzhuthikuttai village in the first phase.\n\nThe farmers complained that the release of water is very meagre and have been pleading with the PWD authorities to step up the release, so that the water could reach the tail-end areas.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of farmers staged a demonstration in front of the PWD office in Pethanayakkanpalayam on Tuesday. When the senior PWD officials did not turn, they resorted to a road roko agitation.\n\nOn receiving information, A. Shafiunnisa, Tahsildar, rushed to the spot and held discussion with the agitating farmers. P. Shanmugasundaram, Deputy SP, Vazhappadi, too, pacified the farmers assuring steps for stepping up water release, following which they dispersed peacefully.",
