Chinnaiah was the talk of the town in the early 1940s when the Dravidian movement had made steady inroads in the State.\n\nHers was the first \u201c Seerthirutha Kalyanam \u201d (Self-respect marriage) in the State conducted in October 1941 by the late Dravidian leader C. Annadurai who later on founded the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).\n\nAlthough the wedding held in the Tamil month of \u2018 Purattasi\u2019 at Tiruchi was a simple event, it definitely set off a renaissance of sorts across the State in those times.\n\nSampoornam was 19 years old then, while her husband was 15 years elder to her.\n\nWell-attended wedding\n\nThe marriage was attended by the late Tamil scholar and social activist K.A.P. Viswanatham, lawyer T.P. Vedachalam and language warrior Visalakshi Ramasubbu among others.\n\nIn an interview to The Hindu in February 2015 Ms. Sampoornam, who worked as a teacher, had recalled how orders were placed for just two rose garlands and 50 rose flowers for her self-respect marriage. Her elder brother Simon Ramasamy was instrumental in organising the self-respect marriage.\n\nBorn in a family of five, Ms. Sampoornam\u2019s elder sister Porselvi Ilamurugu was closely involved with the family of DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi. Ms. Sampoornam who was blessed with three sons and a daughter lost her husband in a road accident years ago.\n\nHer elder son passed away some time ago, while her other sons stay in Tiruchi and Madurai.",
