VIMAL KUMAR\n\nSports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) is all set to construct the first swimming pool and sports hostel under the government sector in the district headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe have selected 11.5 acres at Neruparichal here for the sports complex project which will have facilities for certain indoor sports such as table tennis apart from the pool and hostel,\u201d said District Sports Officer Noeline John.\n\nAccording to SDAT officials, the setting up of the hostel exclusively for sports persons will help provide residential facilities to talented youngsters from rural areas and help them excel in the respective areas. The project cost estimation will be completed soon before the construction works begin.\n\nEven as the new facility is going to come up, the multi-purpose indoor stadium built at Rs. 4.40 crore on a public-private partnership mode by the SDAT on the Chikkanna Government Arts College campus has not yet been commissioned.\n\nThe indoor stadium project was actually sanctioned during 2008-09 financial year. Many hitches occurred since then and the construction works began only in 2014. Even as the construction progressed too, minor setbacks occurred as leakages were noticed on the side walls.\n\nSDAT officials said the stadium was expected to be commissioned within two months as only some interiors works need to be completed.",
