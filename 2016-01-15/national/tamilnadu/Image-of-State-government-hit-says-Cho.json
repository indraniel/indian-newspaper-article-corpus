Ramaswamy on Thursday said the State government\u2019s image as a strong handler of law and order has taken a beating.\n\n\u201cThere are complaints that the law and order situation in the State is not good. Corruption being rampant is another complaint that one is hearing,\u201d Mr. Cho said at the 46th anniversary of Thuglak here.\n\nThe ailing commentator sat through the three-hour-long meeting.\n\n\u201cThe opinion that used to be prevalent among people that State government is generally strong against goondas is now at a low level,\u201d Mr. Cho charged.\n\nHe called upon the people of Tamil Nadu to shun the practice of taking cash for votes.\n\n\u201cThe Jayalalithaa government has, however, got many things right, especially on issues such as the Mullaperiyar dam and rooting out family politics in the State,\u201d he said taking a dig at the DMK.\n\n\u201c(DMDK leader) Vijayakant is in a position to split the votes during the elections. He has managed to maintain his party\u2019s vote share of 8-9 per cent, which is a tremendous achievement,\u201d Mr. Cho said.\n\nPMK MP Anbumani Ramadoss used the platform to promote his party\u2019s cause for a shot at governance and called for prohibition and free and quality education. \u201cWe will come up with a separate budget for farmers and agriculture if we come to power,\u201d he said.\n\nTNCC president EVKS Elangovan said politics has become a platform exploited by people to make money by all means.\n\nUnion Minister of State and BJP leader Pon. Radhakrishnan said, \u201cWe hope a government like the one in Gujarat is formed in Tamil Nadu too so that the success can be replicated here.\u201d\n\nTMC leader S.R. Balasubramanian felt the State government should have publicised the relief work undertaken during the floods. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t do what it said, but it didn\u2019t say what it did. It should have publicised its work properly so that it did not receive so much flak for the good work done.\u201d\n\nAll India Samthuva Makkal Katchi president Sarath Kumar and AIADMK MLA Pazha Karuppiah participated.",
