Siva Saravanan.\n\nDemonstrations urging the State and Centre to take steps to revoke the ban on jallikattu and rekla race continued for the second day on Thursday. Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Peravai and Tamil Nadu Rekla Club organised a signature campaign to show their support for the sports from the public. They also sought a ban on organisations opposing the sports.\n\nOrganising chairman of Tamil Nadu Rekla Club and district president of Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Peravai R.S. Thirumurugan said that He said that the population of local breed cattle in the State had already come down from 14 lakh a few years ago to around 1.5 lakh now. \u201cWhile a few breeds have already become extinct, the ban will soon make the other breeds extinct, as these bulls are raised only for the sport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe court should consider modifying rules for the game to suit the modern world, but not ban it\u2026,\u201d Mr. Thirumurugan said.\n\nHe added that signatures collected during the campaign would be sent to the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister.\n\nMeanwhile, around 25 members of Naam Tamilar Katchi were arrested by Race Course Police for staging a demonstration at South Taluk Office on Thursday pressing for the same demand. They were released later.",
