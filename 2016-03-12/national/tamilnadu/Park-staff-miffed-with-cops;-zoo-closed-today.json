In protest against the filing of the case and the ill-treatment by the police, the workers have decided to shut the zoo on Saturday.\n\nSantosh Kumar said, \u201cI was given a notice on Tuesday that a case had been filed against me and Range Forest Officers. I had sent an officer on Wednesday, but police insisted that I come in person. I went at 1 p.m. Initially, they made me wait saying the computer operator had not arrived.\u201d At 2.30 p.m., the police began to take his statement.\n\n\u201cBut they made glaring mistakes and had to redo the entire process. That is when I realised that they were deliberately harassing us. Once I had given my statement, they told me to wait till the sub-inspector arrived. At 6 p.m., I told them I had to leave. The policemen then gheraoed my car. It was only when I called my seniors that they let me go.\" He expressed ignorance about a bandh call.\n\nA senior police officer said, \u201cThe director was summoned in connection with the investigation into a complaint. There may be delays due to pending complaints or technical issues, but there was no harassment.\"",
