Gunasekaran said that the government had promised to utilise the complex in Karumandurai for the benefit of the tribals.\n\nThe area also comes under the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) and the funds for the development is being released by the Central government through the Tribal Sub Plan (TSP).. The fund under TSP is meant for family oriented income generating activities mainly through small industries. About 50 tribal youths had been imparted skilled training in photography in the complex recently.\n\nThe commercial complex in the area is the only source for promoting skill training for the tribals and is also fast developing as the hub of business activities.\n\nBut, some vested interest groups are aiming to lease out to non-tribals. Local people gathered and raised their voice against this act. Hence, the council demanded the intervention of the department so as to render justice by entrusting the entire commercial complex to tribals.\n\nThe complex is the only source for promoting skill training for tribal people",
