Sasidharan said, \u201cThe Press Club has been highlighting various political and social issues and acted as a watchdog to ensure free and fair election to elect members to Parliament, Legislative Assembly and local bodies. Such being the relevancy of press, it is really surprising that the Press Club itself has not conducted election to elect its Managing Committee for the last 16 years.\u201d",
