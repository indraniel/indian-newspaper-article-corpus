    "text": "Flags down drunk driver and then takes the wheel of heavy vehicle\n\nAn over-enthusiastic traffic policeman landed in a whole lot of trouble on Wednesday night when he took the wheel of a seized truck near HSR Layout flyover.\n\nHe lost control of the heavy vehicle and rammed into several other vehicles. No one was injured, but angry motorists beat up constable Mahaveer Nerale and pelted stones at personnel in a patrol vehicle who tried to intervene.\n\nPassers-by alleged that Nerale was drunk, but inquiries revealed another detail \u2014 he did not have expertise to drive a heavy vehicle. Police are awaiting the medical report to ascertain whether he was inebriated.\n\nAround 10.15 p.m., Nerale and Senior Assistant Sub-Inspector E. C. Mutt ended a special drive against motorists driving under the influence of alcohol at HSR Layout. They were on their home when they saw a truck being driving carelessly on the road.\n\nThe duo flagged down the truck and found that the driver was inebriated. They booked him and seized the truck. As there was no one around to drive the truck to the station, Nerale volunteered to do so. However, he lost control of the heavy vehicle and rammed into four cars before being able to bring it to a halt.",
