    "text": "P.R. Sundaram, MP, has urged the Central government to expedite setting up of All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in the State without further delay.\n\nSpeaking during the zero hour in the Lok Sabha on Thursday evening, he said that during the Union Budget 2014-15, it was announced that new AIIMS would be set up in different places in the country. The State government had already identified the required land at Sengapatti in Thanjavur district, Chengalpattu in Kanchipuram district, Pudukottai town in Pudukottai district, Perundurai in Erode district and Thoppur in Madurai district.\n\nLater, in the Union Budget 2015-16, the Centre announced that AIIMS would be established in Tamil Nadu. A central team also visited the five identified locations in April 2015. However, a final decision on the location of AIIMS in the State was not announced. Hence, the MP demanded that the Centre announce the location at the earliest.",
