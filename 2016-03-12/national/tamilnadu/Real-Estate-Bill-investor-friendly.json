Consumers are already subject to a lot of problems in the form of delays in taking possession of their homes due to financial challenges faced by builders. It will be initially tough, but gradually over a period of time, things will fall in place.\u201d\n\nAn analyst in a real estate firm said there would be both short- and long-term benefits.\n\n\u201cThe Bill will primarily protect the interests of home-buyers, while making the industry a lot more credible and organised,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Prabhu too agreed, stating that over a course of time, \u201cnon-professional\u201d organisations will be pushed out of the industry, paving the way for only companies that do not deviate from planning permits or violate norms to be in the field of housing development and promotion.\n\nHe said the provisions in the Bill were aimed at ensuring timely delivery of projects and also making it possible for government agencies to levy a penalty on builders who do not stick to their scheduled date of project completion.\n\n\u201cThis is a welcome move and we were expecting this for a long time. Consumers\u2019 point of view has been safeguarded. Developers should not take certain provisions negatively as the Bill only expects developers to deliver and perform,\u201d said Rajesh Dave, immediate past-president of Chennai Real Estate Agents\u2019 Association.\n\nRecalling the multi-storey building collapse of June 2014, Mr. Dave said that with the developer abandoning the project and banks pursuing borrowers for repayment of money, the Bill would eliminate the worries of investors.\n\nIt would also pave the way for funding by banks and even foreign financial institutions in housing projects as finally, real estate was getting an \u201cindustry status,\u201d he added.\n\nAjit Kumar Chordia, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, Chennai, said they welcomed the move and that they looked forward to single window clearance, online approvals and model building bye-laws.",
