    "text": "\u2018Same court had earlier held setting bus on fire with students inside was highest degree of brutality\u2019\n\nThe family of V. Kokilavani, one of the three girls who were charred to death when AIADMK cadre set fire to a bus in February 2000 in Dharmapuri, is distraught over the Supreme Court\u2019s order commuting the death sentences of the three convicts in the case on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe same court had earlier held that setting the bus on fire with students inside was the highest degree of brutality. Now, it has reversed its order. My daughter was burnt alive and my family has not got justice,\u201d was how Mr Veerasamy, Kokilavani\u2019s father reacted. He felt that the Supreme Court, by commuting the death sentence of the convicts has nullified the judgments awarded by the trial court and appellate courts.\n\n\u2018Can\u2019t accept argument\u2019\n\n\u201cWould any father, whose son or daughter was burnt alive, accept the argument that such crimes were a result of mob psychology,\u201d Mr. Veerasamy asked.\n\n\u2018Painful 16 years\u2019\n\nAccording to him, Ms. Kokilavani\u2019s death had a life-changing effect on his family. His wife has remained bed-ridden.\n\n\u201cThe past 16 years has been painful and today\u2019s verdict has pierced our hearts,\u201d he said.\n\nSurvived by two sons, Mr. Veerasamy rents out a tempo and earns his livelihood in A.S. Pettai in Namakkal town.",
