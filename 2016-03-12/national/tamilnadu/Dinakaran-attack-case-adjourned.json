    "text": "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday informed the Madras High Court Bench here that one of the accused in the 2007 Dinakaran newspaper office attack case had flown to Malaysia and sought time to arrest all 12 accused against whom non-bailable warrants had been issued for delaying the hearing of an appeal filed against their acquittal in 2009. Accepting the plea, a Division Bench of Justices A. Selvam and V.S. Ravi adjourned the hearing on the appeal to April 18. They also remanded till then, I. Ruban, one of the accused who was produced before them on Friday after obtaining a Prisoner Transit Warrant since he was already lodged in Vellore Central Prison in connection with another case.",
