    "text": "The additional district munsiff court here directed the \u2018Lingaa\u2019 production team to submit the story script by Monday (March 14).\n\nThe case, which came up for hearing on Friday, witnessed a few heated arguments from both sides.\n\nThe Madurai-based petitioner Ravi Rathnam\u2019s counsel argued that as the case was that the movie titled \u2018Lingaa\u2019 was based on their client\u2019s story \u2013 \u2018Mullaivanam 999,\u2019 the entire script should be submitted, which alone would facilitate in finding the truth. While the advocates appearing for the Lingaa production team contended that there was no need for submission of the script of \u2018Lingaa\u2019, the court, which was hearing the arguments for the last four days, ordered for submission of the script by Monday.\n\nMr. Ravi Rathnam alleged that it was his story that was stolen and given a new title as \u2018Lingaa.\u2019 Hence, he had approached the court seeking justice.",
