But, they did not respond at all,\u201d said Mr. Sagayam, who was posted as Madurai Collector by the Election Commission in March 2011, after announcement of the election schedule.\n\nLater, Mr. Sagayam, as the District Election Officer, addressed students of various colleges on the importance of conducting free and fair elections. He also administered pledge to them that they would not allow any one to induce them with money or gifts to exercise their franchise.\n\nStating that many countries across the globe had some or other specialities \u2013 economic power (US), socialism and equality (Russia) and culture and population (China) \u2013 Mr. Sagayam said the significance of India was that it was the largest democracy of the world.\n\n\u201cAnd very fundamental of democracy was on fair elections,\u201d he said.\n\nStating that people should give a thought over their choice in the election, he said they should elect honest people without being influenced by money or gifts,\u201d he said.\n\nStating that 1.66 lakh farmers had committed suicide between 1997 and 2006 in the country, he wondered who the fruits of the nation\u2019s Independence were benefiting.\n\nHe wondered why no syllabi in school and college level had a lesson against corruption in the country.\n\nHe also regretted that no more moral values were being taught in the educational institutions.",
