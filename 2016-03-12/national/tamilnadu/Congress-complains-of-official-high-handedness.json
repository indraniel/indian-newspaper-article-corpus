    "text": "The Congress in Puducherry has complained of an arbitrary act by officials in removal of party flags fitted on the vehicles used by the political parties.\n\nIn a representation to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and Chief Electoral Officer of Puducherry, the Congress party, Puducherry unit vice-president V. Pethaperumal said, \u201cIn the guise of enforcing model code of conduct, the police and other election officials in Puducherry are acting in a high-handed manner. They are forcibly removing party flags of recognised national and regional parties fitted on the vehicles plying on roads for the last two days.\u201d\n\nMr. Pethaperumal said, \u201cThe model code of conduct does not prohibit plying of vehicles with party flags on the roads and even campaigning with party flags are permitted during election time. Therefore, there is no logic in removal of party flags from the vehicles. The high-handed action has curtailed the rights of political parties in the democratic set up.\u201d The Congress party also urged the ECI to issue suitable instructions in this regard and to initiate action against police and election officials concerned for having arbitrarily acted.\n\nThe model code of conduct does not prohibit plying of vehicles with party flags on the roads\n\nV. Pethaperumal\n\nPuducherry Congress vice-president",
