The Supreme Court has specified that the compassion for animals and existence of human beings must be balanced, and that the scope for spread of rabies must be eliminated through controlling the dog population.\n\nThere have been several instances of ward councillors making repeated representations to the civic body to deal with the menace in right earnest.\n\nAccording to a councillor, the funding was not sufficient for vaccinating dogs. The Supreme Court had, late last year, permitted local bodies to eliminate street dogs suffering from incurable ailments.\n\nIn recent years, Mission Rabies was carried out in Erode under the aegis of Indian Project for Animals and Nature (IPAN) and People for Animals (PfA) Coimbatore Unit 2. Erode, according to IPAN records, is one of the 12 worst-affected areas due to dog bites in the country.\n\nHowever, even troublesome dogs cannot be culled. The NGOs involved in birth control programs are required to bring back the dogs to their original location after neutering and vaccination.\n\nAccording to veterinary experts, vaccinated dogs not only lose capacity to breed, but also shed aggressive behaviour.",
