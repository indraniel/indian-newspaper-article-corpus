Kumar\n\nThe Tiruchi Railway Division on Friday conducted a day-long safety awareness campaign on wheels at the Railway station to create awareness among the passengers about safety guidelines that they need to follow while on train and on platforms.\n\nK. Balakrishnan, station superintendent, said that during the awareness campaign, passengers were advised not to carry inflammable materials like kerosene, LPG cylinders and stoves and help the railways ensure safe journey to all passengers.\n\nThey were also requested to observe the smoking ban already in place on railway premises, including coaches, platforms, waiting halls and rest rooms as this would result in fire accidents. Passengers must always use foot over-bridges to cross railway tracks whenever they need to go to the platforms on the other side.\n\nAn LED TV equipped in the special coach also screened short video films on safety measures, including the dos and dont\u2019s to be followed while passing through an unmanned level-crossing, desisting from footboard travel, desisting from carrying fire crackers and other inflammable materials in coaches among others. The objective behind this initiative is to create awareness among public on rail safety, Mr. Balakrishnan said.\n\nThe coach was brought here after stop-over at Thanjavur and Cuddalore. It left for Tiruchi after the exhibition concluded at 7 p.m.\n\nEach Railway division is carrying out this awareness initiative.",
