What if it had been severe?\u201d she asked pointing out to the big crack near her door that had been caused by the impact of the collapse.\n\nThree houses had been constructed on the bridge; luckily, as residents put it, the owner of the house at the farthest end was away.\n\n\u201cWe have told them several times not to live there, as it is an old bridge. We have also asked them to move to a better place, but they are reluctant,\u201d said a Greater Chennai Corporation official who had come for inspection.\n\nAlternative housing sought\n\nResidents, however, say they will move only if they are provided with an alternative place. They further claim that they are still waiting for an alternative housing facility, which officials had promised them last year.\n\n\u201cThey had come to number our houses and took our pictures. The officials promised they would allot us a house in Ezhil Nagar. But they now come and ask us to find another place. How can we afford that?\u201d asked K. Priya, a domestic worker.\n\nMany residents have now temporarily moved out to the streets to avoid any mishap.\n\n\u201cOur house is shaking; it can collapse anytime. We do not want to take a chance,\u201d said Meenakshi.\n\n\u201cWe have been living here for the last 50 years. If this is illegal, then give us an alternative place, we will gladly move there,\u201d said R Shekhar, a daily wage labourer, lifting up his kitchenware that had fallen from his house into the crack.",
