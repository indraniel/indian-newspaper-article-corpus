    "text": "The authorities of the University of Madras have been instructed to comply with the High Court\u2019s order on the promotion of an assistant professor in the Dr. Ambedkar Centre for Economic Studies.\n\nThe centre has been embroiled in a long battle for recognition and acceptance for over a decade.\n\nIn 1996, the Ministry of Social Welfare set up Dr. Ambedkar Chair in Economics in the University with funds from Dr. Ambedkar Foundation, New Delhi, and an agreement specifying that it be renewed every five years. S. Ramachandran was appointed as a research officer in the rank of assistant professor.\n\nBy 2001, funds stopped flowing from the Foundation and the State government converted it into a department in 2002, renaming it Department of Developmental Economics. The research officer continued to function from the department. He was, however, denied promotions and he approached the Madras High Court.\n\nThe University in 2014 assured the court that he would be promoted as associate professor within eight weeks. Later the university said it was awaiting a confidential report on the official.\n\nJustice T.S. Sivagnanam, in his order dated March 1, observed that the university had come with lame excuses for delay in releasing the confidential report.",
