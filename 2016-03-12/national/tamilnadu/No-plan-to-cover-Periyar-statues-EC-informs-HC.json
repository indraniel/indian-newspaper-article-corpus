    "text": "The Election Commission on Friday informed the Madras High Court that it has no plans to cover the statues of Periyar, as apprehended by the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK) throughout the State in view of the upcoming Assembly elections.\n\nThe Chief Electoral Officer, Tamil Nadu, made the submissions before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Vimala on a plea moved by the DVK seeking a direction to the Commission to refrain from closing/ covering the statues of Periyar, removing the flag and pole post of the DVK, which is a non-political party. The petitioner contended that Periyar has never participated in electoral politics, but was fighting for the upliftment of the oppressed and downtrodden, particularly the Scheduled Caste and Backward Castes.\n\n\u201cOn March 5, election officials in Coimbatore District directed the functionaries of the DVK to remove the organisation\u2019s flag and cover Periyar statue. The officials insisted on removing the flags even after the cadres informed them about an injunction granted by the Madras High Court,\u201d Rethinasamy, DVK organisation secretary, said.\n\nThe DVK submitted that the officials failed to respond to a representation sent in this regard on March 6.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing, counsel for the Commission informed the court that it has no such idea.\n\nRecoding the submission, the Bench said, \u201cAs far as the allegations regarding removal of flags, it is open to the petitioner to make a detailed representation to the Commission. As and when such representation is made, the Commission shall consider the same and take appropriate decision.\n\nDVK say officials directed cadre to remove flags, cover statues",
