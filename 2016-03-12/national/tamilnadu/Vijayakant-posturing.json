    "text": "Former Union Health Minister and PMK chief ministerial candidate, Anbumani Ramadoss, on Friday said the DMDK\u2019s announcement of going it alone in the Assembly elections looked more like posturing than a committed stand.\n\n\u201cDMDK leader Vijayakant suddenly comes on stage and says no negotiations took place with anyone. If so, why did he wait so long to announce? He could have said this long ago,\u201d Mr. Anbumani charged and added that even during the run up to the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Vijayakant held a rally and said the cadres wanted him to go alone. \u201cBut he eventually joined the NDA,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Dharmapuri MP said the DMDK stating that it was the true alternative to the two Dravidian parties was amusing. \u201cWhat is the record of Mr. Vijayakant as Leader of the Opposition? He did not even have the courage to attend the proceedings. What would such a person do if he becomes the Chief Minister?\u201d he stated.\n\nMr. Anbumani said unlike Mr. Vijayakant, he had proven track record as the Union Health Minister. \u201cThe PMK is the only party that has been consistent with its announcement that we will not align with the Dravidian parties anymore,\u201d he claimed.",
