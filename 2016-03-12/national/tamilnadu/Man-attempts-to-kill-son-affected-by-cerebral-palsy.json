    "text": "In a shocking incident, a man attempted to murder his 18-year-old son affected by cerebral palsy by administering an overdose of anti-epilepsy tablets and ant poison at Vannivayal near here.\n\nPolice said the son, who was under the care of his mother, was alone at home when his father M. Hussain, a brick kiln worker, allegedly in an inebriated condition, administered an overdose of the pills and ant poison powder on Thursday evening. When the mother, Sumaiah (40), returned home she found her son lying in an unconscious state.\n\nWhen she questioned her husband, he told her that he made him swallow the whole bunch of tablets as he considered his son, who had permanent movement disorders, a burden.\n\nSumaiah rushed him to the Government district headquarters hospital here, where the boy was admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital sources said that his condition was \u2018bad.\u2019\n\nPolice slapped an attempt-to-murder case on Hussain, who is absconding since Thursday evening.\n\nAs he also harassed his wife, police also charged him under Section 4 of Women Harassment Act. Sumaiah, a farm worker, who lodged the complaint, said that he often harassed and beat her for begetting the \u2018abnormal child.\u2019 Every time he was drunk, he would threaten to kill him, she said. She could not afford to stay at home all the time as she had to go out for work to eke out a living, she said.\n\nThe police booked Hussain under Sections 294(b) (uttering obscene words), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe Bazaar police, which registered the case, have launched a hunt for the accused.",
