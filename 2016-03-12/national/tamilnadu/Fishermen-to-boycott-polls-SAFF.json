Fr. Churchill, general secretary, South Asian Fishermen Fraternity, told The Hindu here on Friday that nearly 10 per cent of total voters \u2013 1.5 lakh \u2013 will boycott the election. Fishermen lived in large numbers in Killiyoor, Kanyakumari, Colachel and Vilavancode constituencies in Kanyakumari district, he said.\n\nBifurcating the agriculture ministry and creating a separate ministry for fisheries and fishermen welfare at the Centre is the need of the hour. He said that a progressive legislation, Fishermen and other traditional coastal communities rights (recognition of fishermen rights) Act, on the lines of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights Act) 2006 should be enacted by the Union government. Similarly, as per the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, the Union government should bring fishermen community under the Scheduled Tribes list. Fr. Churchil said that the various forums for fishermen had staged a protest in New Delhi on Thursday pressing their legitimate demands.\n\nA petition was submitted to the Collector by SAFF on Thursday, he added.",
