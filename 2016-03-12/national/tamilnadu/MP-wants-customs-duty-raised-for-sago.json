    "text": "Member of Parliament P.R. Sundaram has urged the Central government to raise tariff rates and customs duty for tapioca, starch and sago so that the domestic market is protected.\n\nRaising the issue under rule 377 in Parliament on Thursday, he said that there are about 450 starch and sago manufacturing units operating in various districts in Tamil Nadu which provides employment to over 70,000 people, of which the majority are women.\n\nAlso, 1.2 lakh farmers are dependent on cultivation of tapioca, a raw material for starch and sago industry.\n\nBut, abolition of special additional duty of 4 per cent and reduction in customs duty on modified starch from 30 per cent to 20 per cent has resulted in indiscriminate imports from Thailand and other countries, he added.\n\nHence, to protect the domestic industry, there is a need to include tapioca starch, sago and modified starch in the negative list to Free Trade Agreement. He urged the government to raise tariff rates and effective rates of customs duty for these three commodities to protect the domestic industry.",
