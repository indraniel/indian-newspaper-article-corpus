    "text": "A sum of Rs.1.50 lakh was seized from a luxury vehicle, which was proceeding on the Melur-Sivaganga stretch on Friday.\n\nWhen the staff on election duty intercepted the vehicle and checked it, the money was found. Preliminary inquiries suggested the money was \u201cunaccounted.\u201d Hence, the team seized it.\n\nWith the seizure of the Rs.1.50 lakh, the total sum seized till Friday stood at Rs.12.32 lakh, according to a press release. Meanwhile, officials said that the single seizure of Rs.10 lakh on Thursday had been informed to the Department of Income Tax. As and when the owner of the cash accounted as per the laws, the money would be released.\n\nMany traders expressed concern over the manner in which the officials carried out checks and harassed them. However, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the Election Commission of India had clearly given a set of instructions with the aim to conduct free and fair elections. Hence, the public should cooperate. He assured that public carrying money with proper documents would be permitted. The rules were available in the election commission website.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Rao visited a few polling stations in Melur Assembly constituency. He directed the officials to erase wall paintings near Therkutheru and Narasingampatti as they were still not clearly erased. He checked whether there were provisions for differently-abled persons to use the centre and cast votes without difficulty in polling stations. The provisions made for drinking water availability among others were explained to him by Melur Assembly election officer Murugeswari during the inspection.",
