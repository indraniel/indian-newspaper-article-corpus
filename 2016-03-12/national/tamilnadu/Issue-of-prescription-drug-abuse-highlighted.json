Thirumagal, programme coordinator, T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation (TTRCRF).\n\nShe was speaking to The Hindu at the closing ceremony of a one-month course on drug de-addiction counselling held in the city on Friday and sponsored by the National Institute of Social Defence, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India.\n\n\u201cIt is a combination of alcohol and prescription drug abuse among many middle-aged men. Among women, it is mainly pain killers, which they start taking after some major injury. However, the most worrying trend is the use of \u2018ganja\u2019 by teenagers. It makes them angry,\u201d she said.\n\nPrem Anand Sinha, zonal director, Narcotics Control Bureau, was the chief guest. He spoke on substance abuse and also gave away certificates.\n\nOver 25 persons from NGOs across the city took part. They were trained in topics such as addiction as a brain disease, problems faced by family members, drugs and abuse, basic counselling skills, treatment planning, sessions for patients and family, community-based treatment and relapse prevention.",
