    "text": "The district election office has introduced single-window system to facilitate political parties, candidates and others seeking clearances from various departments and agencies for putting up banners, posters and advertisements, holding election rallies and camps, arranging public campaign meetings and making transport arrangements, including helicopter landing.\n\nAddressing a training programme for election and police officials in this connection here on Thursday, Collector T.N. Hariharan said that political parties and candidates approached officers in the revenue, police and transport departments, urban local bodies and gram panchayats for permission so far. They wasted most of their time in approaching several departments so far. Hence the State election office had set up a single-window system to avoid such inconveniences.\n\nThe candidates may submit applications either through the concerned election officer or upload them onwww.elections.tn.gov.inwebsite. Those in charge of the single-window system would ensure that the clearance was obtained and furnished to the parties and individuals, he added.\n\nThe applications would be sent to the concerned police station for processing. Later, no objection certificate would be issued to the concerned political parties by the respective election officers, he pointed out.\n\nPolice and revenue officials and station house officers of seven Assembly constituencies took part in the meeting.",
