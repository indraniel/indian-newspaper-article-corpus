Sagayam.\n\nHe was addressing the 63{+r}{+d}college day at the Fatima College here on Friday.\n\nStating that every student, irrespective of their economic background, brought up in urban or rural area and taught through Tamil or English medium of instruction had every opportunity to come up in life. He advised the students to look beyond the classroom teaching to sharpen their mind and acquire necessary skills.\n\n\u201cThe reader will become the leader,\u201d he said to drive home the point that students should get an all-round knowledge about the world.\n\nRecalling history of Thomas Alva Edison, who was not appreciated by his wife for his invention of bulb in the dead of the night, he said even the close circle of people would not encourage students to come up in life.\n\n\u201cYou should learn to motivate yourself,\u201d he said. Complaining that some people were cheating the common man in the guise of patriots, Mr. Sagayam said that students should try to become true patriots who upon acquiring their skills should give back to the nation by helping the society.\n\nHe advised the teachers to help the students not only to become top civil servants, professors and scientists, but also to become good human beings.
