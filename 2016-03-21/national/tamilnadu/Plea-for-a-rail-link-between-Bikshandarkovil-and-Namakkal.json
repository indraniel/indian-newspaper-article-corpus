    "text": "The Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, has urged the Southern Railway to take up a survey for providing rail link between Bikshandarkovil and Namakkal.\n\nA resolution adopted at its executive committee meeting of the council held here on Saturday, referred to the oft-repeated plea in this regard in the wake of the growing demand for the rail link between Tiruchi and Namakkal.\n\nAnother resolution welcomed the Centre\u2019s decision on introducing Digital Depository for school leaving certificates, plus two mark sheets, other certificates and other awards.\n\nThis would avoid exploitation by private institutions and deemed universities. The digital depository would eliminate the need for surrendering the certificates and awards.\n\nThe meeting, through another resolution, wanted the term \u2018LSS\u2019 removed from buses for ensuring uniform prices in fares.\n\nThe meeting also urged the district authorities and the Education Department to come to the rescue of students of a private school in Ramalinga Nagar and take action for their admission to other recognised CBSE school as an alternative measure for their educational career.\n\nS. Pushpavanam, secretary of the council, read out a report. C.T. Selvakumar, president, presided over the meeting.",
