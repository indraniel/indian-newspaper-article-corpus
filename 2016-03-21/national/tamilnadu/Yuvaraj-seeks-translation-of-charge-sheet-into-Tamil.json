Gokulraj murder case, has submitted a petition in the court seeking translation of the 1,318-page charge sheet that was served on him recently in Tamil.\n\nThe charge sheet was served on all the 17 accused \u2013 seven detained under the Goondas Act, and 10 others released on bail. Since the case was registered under the SC/ST Act, Chief Judicial Magistrate S. Malarmathy transferred it to the court of the Principal District Judge (PDJ) and asked the accused to be present in the court.\n\nOn Thursday, Yuvaraj was brought from Vellore Central Prison, while the six others were brought from Salem Central Prison.\n\nIn the absence of PDJ, the case came up for hearing before Additional District Judge V. Sampathkumar. Yuvaraj submitted a petition seeking translation of the charge sheet in Tamil. The judge extended the custody of Yuvaraj and six others till March 30.\n\nYuvaraj circulated a five-page letter to media urging the Tirupur SP to conduct the investigation in the Dalit student murder in a proper way.",
