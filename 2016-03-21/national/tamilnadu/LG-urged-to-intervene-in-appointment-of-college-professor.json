    "text": "Lieutenant Governor A.K.Singh has been urged to intervene in the matter of appointing a senior professor as principal in- charge of Pondicherry Engineering College.\n\nSending a memorandum, Pondicherry State Students and Parents Welfare Association V. Balasubramanian said tbe college was recently upgraded as a Technical University.\n\nInstead of appointing a Vice- Chancellor (VC) to the technical university, the Government has called for appointment of a full-time principal. Without appointment of the VC to the university, there is neither exigency nor necessity for selecting a full-time principal for a short duration, he said.\n\nWhile so, the incumbent principal of the college D.Govindarajulu is retiring on March 31.\n\nThe college administration sent proposal to the government for its approval to appointment principal in charge by selecting a senior person among the professors as an interim measure.\n\nPondicherry State Students and Parents\u2019 Welfare Association alleged that some vested section of the college has been making effort to appoint a professor in dishonouring the sanctity of the seniority list of professor.",
