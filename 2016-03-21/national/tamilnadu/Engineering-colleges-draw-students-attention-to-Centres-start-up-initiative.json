During a subsequent programme organised by Confederation of Indian Industry, top industrialists interacted with students to motivate them.\n\nA year ago, the Centre received \u2018Best E-Cell, Entrepreneurship Eco System Builder Award from the Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and National Entrepreneurship Network.\n\nLast month, Bannari Amman Institute of Technology launched start-ups conceptualised by students, during E-Week celebrations organised by its Entrepreneurship Development Cell and Technology Business Incubator.
