    "text": "Forging of electoral alliance by the Dravidian parties with caste-based political outfits that were inciting caste fanaticism and male chauvinism only gave recognition to such organisations, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has charged.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Sunday, party leader U. Vasuki alleged that it was the poor handling of honour killings by the present government and the police in the past that encouraged such outfights to carry out \u201chonour\u201d killings.\n\nCondemning those inciting fanaticism and violence in the name of caste honour in social media, Ms. Vasuki wanted stringent action against such persons. Someone in the name of an advocate had posted messages online that he would render legal help for anyone who committed \u201chonour\u201d killing.\n\nMs. Vasuki also faulted Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for not condemning the murder of Dalit youth Sankar. \u201cWhile the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam reacted to it after three days, Pattali Makkal Katchi leader S. Ramadoss belittled the serious issue,\u201d she charged.\n\n\u201cWhen the issue was raised with Mr. Ramadoss during a press conference, he asked the journalist to focus on other important issues he had spoken about. He implied that the murder of a Dalit youth was not so important for him. People should identify such parties,\u201d Ms. Vasuki said.\n\n\u201cIf the Chief Minister\u2019s claim of having fulfilled the promise of increasing the farmers\u2019 income by two to three times is true, Azhagar, a farmer from Ariyalur, would have committed suicide and another farmer, Balan of Thanjavur, would not have struggled to repay his last two dues (for a tractor loan),\u201d she noted.",
