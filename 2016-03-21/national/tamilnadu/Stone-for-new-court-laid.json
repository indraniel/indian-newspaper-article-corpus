    "text": "Increase the number of judges in the Madras High Court to clear cases and help litigants get justice quickly, Madras High Court Judge T. Mathivanan said on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking after laying the foundation stone for the new Civil Munsif and Judicial Magistrate Court at Nannilam, he said the number of cases being filed in various courts was increasing every day but the strength of the bench did not permit expeditious disposal of cases.\n\nThe number of judges must be increased and vacancies filled so that litigants benefit from speedy delivery of justice.\n\nHe said the judge-population ratio was 13:one lakh in the United States while it was 1: one lakh in India. It was essential for the administration to ensure that that the poor and the illiterate had easy access to justice and it was their right to enjoy what is enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nPortfolio Judge for Tiruvarur in the Madras High Court, Justice R. Mahadevan noted that the district level judicial apparatus was the principal means of judicial deliverance and it was imperative that the ground level judicial establishment was strengthened for the benefit of the litigants. He said the judiciary would extend all support to complete the construction of the complex estimated to come up at a cost of Rs. 4.07 crore in 12 months.\n\nHigh Court Judge C.T. Selvam pointed out that there were some problems with the advocates too and they must get them corrected themselves.\n\nHe wished the Nannilam Bar every success in the days to come.\n\nTiruvarur District Judge V. Sivagnanam, Chief Judicial Magistrate L.S. Sathyamurthy, Nannilam Judicial Magistrate B. Sudha, Bar president T. Radhakrishnan, and secretary D. Deiveegan spoke.",
