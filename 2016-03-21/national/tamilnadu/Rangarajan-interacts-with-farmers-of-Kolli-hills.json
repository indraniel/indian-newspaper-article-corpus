Rangarajan visited the tribal villages in the Kolli hills on Saturday and interacted with the farmers on the problems confronting them.\n\nMr. Rangarajan visited the Semmedu, Vazhvanthinadu and the surrounding villages. The farmers of these villages said that the production of various farm products such cardamom, seeragam spice has come down due to various reasons such as failure of monsoon, during the current crop season. This has badly hit the revenue of the local farmers.\n\nThe farmers\u2019 representatives urged the MP to use his good office to draw the attention of the Centre to increase the procurement price of both cardamom and seeragam immediately.\n\nDue to the poor crop, the price of cardamom has skyrocketed.
