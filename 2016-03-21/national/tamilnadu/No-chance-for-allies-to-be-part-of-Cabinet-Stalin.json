    "text": "DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Sunday categorically said there was no possibility of accommodating its allies in the State cabinet if the party formed the next government.\n\nMr. Stalin who arrived in the city to take part in the Social Justice Conference organised by the Dravidar Kazhagam said more organisations would soon join the DMK-led front in the run-up to the upcoming elections. Several organisations and outfits had come forward to extend their support to the DMK whether they were given seats or not, as they were disgusted with the ruling AIADMK government, he said.\n\nReplying to a query on the functioning of the Election Commission, Mr. Stalin told reporters at the airport here that there were some flaws here and there. The DMK high command had been lodging complaints regarding defects to officials concerned as well as the Election Commission in New Delhi. Action had been initiated to a certain extent, he said. The party also approached the Madras High Court in this regard. Asked when the party\u2019s poll manifesto and the candidates\u2019 list would be released, Mr. Stalin said they would be released once they were ready.",
