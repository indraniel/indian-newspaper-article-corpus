According to sources at Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the project has received clearance from Finance Ministry and has been sent to the Union Cabinet for approval.\n\n\u201cWe have already called for tenders for the underground section of the project sometime ago. Once the final approval comes in, full-fledged work may begin. Once the work commences, we plan to finish it in three years,\u201d an official said.\n\nWhile CMRL officials have called for tenders for the underground stretch, they are also in the process of acquiring land for the project. After the final clearance comes from the Union Cabinet, they plan to call for tenders for the elevated stretch too.\n\nChennai Metro Rail\u2019s phase I extension is estimated to cost Rs. 3,700 crore and cover 9 km of North Chennai from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar. The first portion of the corridor from Washermenpet to Korukkupet will be underground and the alignment continues beyond this junction as an elevated stretch up to Wimco Nagar.\n\nThis project has had a long wait for approval. Though the State government gave its approval in 2010 after the soil tests were completed, the Centre\u2019s permission is yet to come. Sometime ago, Union Minister for Urban Development M. Venkaiah Naidu had announced that his Ministry had given clearance and sent the project to the Finance Ministry for approval. Now, the project waits for the final nod of the Union Cabinet.",
