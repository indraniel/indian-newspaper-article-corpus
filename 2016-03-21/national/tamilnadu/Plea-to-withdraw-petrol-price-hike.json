    "text": "The Tiruchi District Consumer Movement has urged the Centre to withdraw the right assigned to the petroleum companies to fix the price for petrol and diesel. A resolution adopted at its meeting held here on Sunday, urged the Centre to withdraw the recent hike in the prices of petroleum products.\n\nAnother resolution wanted Tiruverambur to be declared as a halting station for all Express trains, as Tiruverambur is a vital junction for students of National Institute of Technology \u2013 Tiruchi, employees of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited and other major organisations. Another resolution pleaded for introduction of a day-train service between Tiruchi and Mysore.\n\nV. Maheswaran, president of the Movement, presided over the meeting.",
