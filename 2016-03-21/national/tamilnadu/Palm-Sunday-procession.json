They marched from St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral in Melapudur. This annual festival signifies the celebration of the victorious entry of Lord Jesus Christ into Jerusalem which is known as \u2018Palm Sunday.\u2019\n\nFor many churches, Palm Sunday, often referred to as \u2018Passion Sunday,\u2019 marks the beginning of Holy Week which concludes on Easter Sunday. According to the Bible, when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the crowd greeted Him by waving olive branches and by covering the path en route with olive and palm branches. To mark this event, Palm Sunday assumes the significance of distribution of palm leaves often tied to Cross to the worshippers in churches.\n\nA similar procession was taken out at various parts of the central districts. At Velankanni, a large number of Christians marched down in the town to mark the festival.",
