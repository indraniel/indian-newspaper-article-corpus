    "text": "The long duration for electioneering does not seem to be to the liking of the local leaders of several political parties.\n\nOne reason that they say is that they have to work overtime to maintain the election tempo - not only among the voters, but also among the party cadre.\n\nA section of the public also complains that the extended campaign period has rendered the entire official machinery standstill. In the last Lok Sabha elections, the political parties got less than 50 days for campaigning.\n\nBut for the present Assembly elections, the campaign period is more than 70 days from the date of announcement of the poll schedule on March 4.\n\nWith about 55 days left for the polling day on May 16, the leaders and cadre of all the major political parties are gearing themselves up to approach the voters.\n\nThe longer period for campaigning means spending more money, they point out.\n\nThe Election Commission gave a little less than one month\u2019s time for electioneering in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nEven though political parties resented then that it was too short period for electioneering, it saved many precious days, prevented wastage of manpower and money.\n\nA. Mohan, Salem district secretary of the CPI, conceded that the longer period has only increased the work pressure on both, the major and small political outfits.\n\nHowever, for one reason the opposition parties in unison welcome the announcement of poll schedule much in advance, as it led to the halting of government development works, which they complained were announced and inaugurated with an eye of the forthcoming elections.",
