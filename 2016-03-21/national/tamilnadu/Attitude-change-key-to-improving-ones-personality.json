Radha, trainer from \u2018Smart Series\u2019 Bengaluru in her inaugural address emphasised that the success of the personality development programme depended largely on the trainees and hence urged the students to improve learning skills with an open mind and enthusiasm.\n\nEarlier, C.B.T.Rajagopalasamy, Professor, welcomed the gathering. A total of 76 students of FCRI participated in the training.\n\nR.Jeyashakila, Chair, School of Harvest and Post-Harvest Technology, proposed a vote of thanks.",
