    "text": "At least 30 passengers were injured when a speeding government-run bus hit the median at the Toll Gate on Ring Road on Sunday morning.\n\nPolice said that V. Muthiah (53), driver of the bus proceeding to Madurai from Thayamangalam, had chosen to go through the wrong lane to cross the toll gate. However, on seeing another vehicle coming in the opposite direction, he tried to switch the lane.\n\nHowever, he could not control the speeding bus and eventually the vehicle rammed the median at the erstwhile Corporation Toll Gate number 2 around 7.30 a.m.\n\nThe bus was badly damaged and around 30 passengers sustained minor injuries. The driver, who is from Othakadai near here, sustained serious injury on his abdomen. The conductor, Saravanan (40) of Sellur, was also injured. They were rushed to Government Rajaji Hospital. The City Traffic Investigating Wing is probing the case.\n\nIn a similar accident reported at the same toll gate a few months back, one passenger was killed.",
