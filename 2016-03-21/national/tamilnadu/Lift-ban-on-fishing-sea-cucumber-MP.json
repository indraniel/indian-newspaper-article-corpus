Anwar Raja has appealed to the Centre and Ministry of Environment to lift the ban on fishing sea cucumber in the Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar region.\n\nThe MP who had recently raised the issue in Parliament, said it was wrong on the part of the BJP-led NDA government to include sea cucumber in the list of 60 endangered marine species under schedule 1 of the Wild Life Protection Act (WLPA) and ban the fishing.\n\nHe said when the breeding of sea cucumber was found abundant in the south-east sea coast region, it was totally unwarranted to classify the species under the list of endangered species and impose the ban.\n\nFishermen in this region, who inadvertently catch the species, were put to untold hardship as the Forest department personnel foist cases on them, he said. The ban has aggravated the agonies of the fishermen, who were repeatedly harassed by the Sri Lankan navy when they set out for fishing in the Palk Bay, he said.\n\nPointing out that sea cucumber was consumed as sea food and as medicine in the south Asian countries, the MP said export of sea cucumber to these countries was in vogue for several hundred years and the ban severely affected the livelihood of the fishing community.\n\nThe worst affected were fishermen in Rameswaram, Pamban, Vedalai, Devipattinam, Mandapam, Kilakarai, Erwadi, Thangachimadam and Danushkodi areas in the district, he said.\n\nExperts said sea cucumber played key role in preserving the ecosystem and acted as bio terminators, but the MP pointed out that even the United Nations had not banned fishing of sea cucumber in any country and demanded the lifting of the ban.",
