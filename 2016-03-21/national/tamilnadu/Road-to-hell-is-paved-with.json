    "text": "A nurse in an ambulance had to ask the driver to pull up for a few minutes so that he could administer an injection to the critically ill patient inside. He found it impossible to find a vein as the ambulance made its bone-rattling way over the awful roads. The stretch was from the Perks Campus Road via Sowripalayam towards a hospital off Avanashi Road.\n\nWorks to improve, widen, or re-lay the damaged roads in the city are mostly only when a VVIP is to come on that the roads or after the rains and this effort too is mostly a cosmetic makeover.\n\nMinisters and other important people should be driven through different roads by turns. Only then is there any hope of having them repaired, said a taxi driver as he swerved to avoid a pothole and then swerved back to avoid a head-on collision. \u201cIt is no secret that a lot of money is not actually spent on the project. But at least a little bit of the sanctioned amount should be directed towards the upkeep of roads,\u201d he said.\n\nThough road rollers, buckets of tar, spades and labourers have apparated here and there, everyone knows these are mostly temporary measures, especially on the smaller stretches.\n\nThe potholes are back even within a year. A weary resident says that her mother has a bad back. The doctor has strictly warned that the elderly lady should not be subject to sudden jerks.\n\n\u201cIt has been months since my mother has even stepped out of home. There is not even a foot long stretch that is smooth on this road,\u201d she says.",
