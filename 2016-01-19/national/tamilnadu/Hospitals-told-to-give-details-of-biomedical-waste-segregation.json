Jyothimani and expert member R. Nagendran on Monday, the petitioner sought to know the details of the biomedical waste segregated in the 41 State-run hospitals and over 350 private hospitals within Chennai district.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) submitted the list of private hospitals in Chennai district, which did not have the consent to operate.\n\nThe Bench directed the hospitals in Chennai district to produce the details of segregation of biomedical waste from them and posted the matter for hearing on February 1.\n\nAlleging there was lack of liquid biomedical waste treatment facilities in hospitals, the petitioner sought a direction for corrective action from the TNPCB.\n\nDuring the hearing of the case earlier, the Bench directed the TNPCB to scrutinise the applications of government hospitals and medical college hospitals within a month for giving its consent after checking whether the biomedical waste disposal units are functioning as per norms.\n\nTNPCB submitted list of private hospitals\n\noperating\n\nwithout consent",
