Prakash (23) from Udumalaipet in Tirupur district.\n\nPrakash, along with two other accomplices, allegedly posted an advertisement in a website, often used by such offenders.\n\nMeanwhile, three men from Chennai, including an engineering student from a renowned college, touched base with Prakash to act as intermediaries for finding potential customers with the aim of selling it for Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh.\n\nDistrict Forest Officer Nihar Ranjan said that the department officials, with the help of informers, pretended as buyers and lured the gang to come to Madurai.\n\nWhen the men reached here from Coimbatore and Chennai on Monday morning, they were nabbed by the forest department officials.\n\nSnake confiscated\n\nThe sand boa they were carrying was also confiscated.\n\nMr. Ranjan said that the youngsters were trying to make quick money. The officials alleged that Prakash acted as the kingpin, and he had already sold at least two sand boas.\n\nCommonly found snake\n\nMr. Ranjan said that sand boas were among the most commonly found snakes. \u201cPoachers attempt to sell them for huge money by attributing false medicinal and other superstitious qualities to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough the snakes were not worth the money, some buy them for large sums with the hope that they can sell them to others for even higher amounts,\u201d he added.\n\nOfficials said that sand boas were protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act.\n\nCases were booked against the six persons, who were later let off with hefty fines as the offence was compoundable.",
