The study, being conducted by Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA), is about fuel conservation in State Transport Undertakings (STU) and done for World Banks\u2019 Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).\n\nAs part of the exercise, drivers will be trained in better driving practices, said A. Janakiram, Additional Director and Chief Regional Co-ordinator, Southern Region, PCRA at the inauguration of the Oil and Gas Conservation Fortnight 2016 on Monday.\n\nThe study that began in October 2015 will be completed in July. \u201cWe have short-listed 20 drivers and they are undergoing training. At the end of the training, on an average, a saving of about 10-15 percent of diesel consumption is possible,\u201d Mr. Janakiram added.\n\nThis project is likely to be replicated in other places too.\n\nState Industries Secretary C.V. Sankar, who inaugurated the event, lauded the efforts of oil companies in highlighting the importance of conservation and also their support during the recent deluge.",
