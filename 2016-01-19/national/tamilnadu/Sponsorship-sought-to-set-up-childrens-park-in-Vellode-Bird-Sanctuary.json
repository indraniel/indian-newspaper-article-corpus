GOVARTHAN\n\nThe Forest Department is looking forward to rope in private sponsors for establishing a Children\u2019s Park in the Vellode Bird Sanctuary campus.\n\nThe Department has already approached a few educational institutions for funding, and has also made a representation to the Revenue authorities to hand over a few acres of poromboke land in the adjoining area for the purpose.\n\nThere has been a gradual rise in the number of visitors to the bird sanctuary, but the sightings are possible only in the early morning and late evening hours. During the course of the day, the visitors are able to spend only little time walking along the pavements and gazing at water and greenery.\n\nCreation of a Children\u2019s Park will make the visits valuable, more so, since the Department has started levying entry fee over the last few months, official sources said.\n\nThe Forest Department has approached a few educational institutions for funding",
