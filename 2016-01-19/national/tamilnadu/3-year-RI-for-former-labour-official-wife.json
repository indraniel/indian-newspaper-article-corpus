Chandran, who was then working in Madurai, and his wife C Jegathambal for allegedly possessing unaccountable wealth valued at Rs. 22.75 lakh. The charge-sheet was filed in 2009.\n\nMr. Chandran (62), presently residing in Virudhunagar district, had served as Deputy Commissioner of Labour in Chennai, Madurai and Salem. Sources said that he was placed under suspension after the case was charge-sheeted.\n\nK. Vanitha, Special Judge of the court, on Monday awarded three years rigorous imprisonment and Rs 20,000 fine to both Mr. Chandran and Ms. Jegathambal. The judge also awarded one more year of simple imprisonment for both, if they failed to pay the fine amount.\n\nThey were not taken to jail immediately as the judge subsequently suspended the sentence and released them on bail.",
