Even the measures announced have not reached the places represented by the opposition parties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe paper mill in the Embalam constituency was closed down and more than 900 lost their jobs. There is corruption even when this land was sold. CBI has filed case against a bureaucrat. But, why have they left the politician involved go scot-free?\u201d he questioned.",
