We were hoping it would happen by Friday, but it did not happen on time. They were expecting it on the day of the festival but it was delayed by a couple of days.\u201d\n\nHe added: However, the bonus came through even while the workers were protesting.\n\n\u201cThe issue has been resolved now he said.",
