    "text": "A private bus plying from Madurai to Bengaluru without permit was impounded by officials of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) near the toll gate in Mohanur here on Sunday night.\n\nThe bus with Karnataka registration was intercepted by the RTO officials after it crossed the toll gate. Verification of the documents revealed that the permit expired recently and was not renewed. Officials imposed a fine of Rs. 73,000, but the bus conductor refused to pay the amount. Hence, all the passengers were asked to step out of the bus and the bus was taken to the office of the RTO. The private operator, meanwhile, arranged an alterative bus.",
