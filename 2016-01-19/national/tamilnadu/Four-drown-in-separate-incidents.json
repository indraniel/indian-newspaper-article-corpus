Venkatesh made a futile bid to rescue Harish and was drowned. The bodies of the boys were retrieved by the locals.\n\nIn another incident, two boys from Salem and Namakkal, visiting a relative here were drowned in a lake. The victims Gopi (19) and his friend Abdul (13) had gone for a swim in Anangur Lake and never returned. The bodies of the boys were retrieved later.",
