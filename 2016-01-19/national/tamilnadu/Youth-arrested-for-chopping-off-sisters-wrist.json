Velmurugan (21) of Puthukkulam under Munneerpallam police station limits attacked his 17-year-old sister with a sickle, chopping off her left wrist, on Monday morning, and escaped. During investigation, the police found that the girl used to speak to her cousin, also from Puthukkulam, which was opposed by Velmurugan.\n\nAs she chose to ignore her brother\u2019s opposition and continued to speak to the boy, Velmurugan chopped off the wrist of the girl, a class XI student.\n\nThe victim was rushed to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital where the surgeons performed a marathon surgery. Though the girl was saved, it is not immediately clear if the reunited part would function normally. \u201cIt will take at least a couple of weeks to ascertain it,\u201d said a doctor.",
