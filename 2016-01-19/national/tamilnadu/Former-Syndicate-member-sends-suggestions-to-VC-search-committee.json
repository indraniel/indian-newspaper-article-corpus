Elangovan, has put forward suggestions for consideration while recommending a panel of persons for the post of VC of the university.\n\nHe said it would be a welcome decision if the committee recommended a panel consisting of scholars belonging to backward class, minorities and Scheduled Castes. He requested the committee to give preference to first generation learner for VC post.\n\nHe also suggested verifying the antecedents of applicants and selected candidates through the jurisdictional police authorities and parent institutions where the applicants had worked or were working before submission to the Chancellor (Governor).\n\nHe objected to the application of P. Asokan, present Controller of Examination of the University for the VC post. He said in the letter that Mr. Asokan was \u201cfacing charges of insubordination and dereliction of duty\u201d and the Syndicate had constituted an inquiry committee under the chairmanship of Director of Collegiate Education, Chennai. The inquiry report was awaited.\n\nHe urged the search committee not to select his application. He also requested Principal Secretary to expedite the disciplinary proceedings initiated against him.",
