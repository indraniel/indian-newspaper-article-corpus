    "text": "Dalits of Kuruvithurai near here said that they were tolerating atrocities by caste Hindus \u2013 from double-tumbler system in tea shops to harassment of girls on buses \u2013 to maintain peace and in the interest of education of their children.\n\nOn Sunday, 16 Dalits, including women, were injured in a mob attack following a quarrel during Pongal festival. \u201cOften we go to police station with complaints of aggression against us. But, the police threaten to file case against our own youths and force us to withdraw complaints,\u201d said G. Bhoopathi (38), a research scholar in Economics.\n\nP. Veeraiah (60), a farmhand, claimed that about a dozen tea shops, run by caste Hindus, offerred tea to Dalits only in plastic cups.\n\nV. Karuppan (44), who was one of the victims of Sunday\u2019s assault by armed caste Hindu youths, said that school and college-going Dalit girls had been advised to put up with the harassment on buses by youths of dominant castes.\n\n\u201cCaste Hindu youths occupy the seats reserved for women and harass the girls by playing indecent songs on their mobile phones,\u201d he complained.\n\nV. Kasinathan, an engineer, said that the police in Kadupatti were highly influenced by the dominant community people. \u201cEven as some of our youths, who were in the police station, wanted the police to rush to our help in the village when the attack was going on, the police took their own time to come to Kuruvithurai,\u201d he said.\n\nS. Vignesh Kumar, who was present at the police station to lodge a complaint against three youths for creating ruckus at the Dalit\u2019s Pongal celebration, concurred with Mr. Kasinathan.\n\nCollector L. Subramanian said that he had assured people of adequate police protection.\n\n\u201cRegarding the complaint of Dalits of not being allowed to sit at the bus stop, we will try to stop that. Other issues have to be looked into,\u201d he said. Superintendent of Police Vijayendra Bidari said that there was no such case of double-tumbler system with the police.\n\nFormer Kuruvithurai panchayat president Pasumpon Maran said that there was not so much caste trouble in the village, though there were certain issues.\n\n\u201cSome are exaggerated complaints. But, we can settle this through peace talks and bring about changes over time. Some elements were creating trouble on both sides,\u201d he said.",
