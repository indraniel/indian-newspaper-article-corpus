    "text": "With stray dogs posing threat to the residents in the city, Salem Citizens Welfare Association has demanded that \u2018ferocious\u2019 dogs on roads be eliminated as per the Supreme Court\u2019s direction.\n\nThere are over 30,000 stray dogs in all the 60 wards in the Corporation limits. Many of the dogs pose threat to pedestrians and motorists as the Corporation\u2019s Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme failed to control the dog population.\n\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister, association secretary P. Arulmani said that the Supreme Court had in 2015 asked authorities to eliminate \u2018irretrievably ill or mortally wounded\u2019 dogs, so that the life of people are protected. The court had also asked the civic authorities to provide shelter and kennels to stray dogs instead of killing them indiscriminately. The court had also asked authorities to submit the details on dog bites, number of stray dogs killed before March 9, 2016 when the next hearing is to come up.\n\nThe letter said that stray dogs continue to pose threat and the civic body failed to provide kennels to them. He urged the Central government to bring necessary amendments to the existing Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 so that the Supreme Court\u2019s order is implemented. On an average 70 to 80 outpatients are treated everyday for dog bites in Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital, it said.\n\nThere are over 30,000 stray dogs in all the 60 wards in the Corporation limits",
