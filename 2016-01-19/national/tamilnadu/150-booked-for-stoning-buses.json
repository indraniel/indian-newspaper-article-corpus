    "text": "The police have registered a case against 150 people from Madikrishnapuram village for stoning of five buses and a police vehicle during a road roko at Mullodai near here on Sunday evening. A clash broke out at Mullodai between residents of Madikrishnapuram and Uchimedu during a funeral procession on the banks of the Thenpennaiyar River.\n\nThe residents were returning after performing the last rites of one Allimuthu on the banks of the Thenpennaiyar in Uchimedu in neighbouring Cuddalore district as Madikrishnapuram has no crematorium. A verbal brawl broke out between the villagers during bursting of crackers during the funeral.\n\nThe Cuddalore police rushed to the spot and chased away the two groups. The group of villagers from Madikrishnapuram on returning to Mullodai blocked traffic on the Puducherry-Cuddalore Road and stoned five buses and a police patrol vehicle in support of their demand for a crematorium. The police resorted to a lathi charge after the agitators refused to lift the blockade.",
