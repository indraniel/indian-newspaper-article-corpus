    "text": "The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India has dismissed accusations from political parties that it was a part of an international conspiracy to wipe out traditional breeds of bulls and said it would continue to strive for the rights of animals.\n\nIn an FAQ put up on its website following the jallikattu controversy, PETA India said that it was not targeting the traditional sport of Tamil Nadu alone but all cruel practices against animals. Citing media reports, the organisation said jallikattu provides no monetary incentive to farmers as prizes the bulls fetch at the event are insignificant.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s essentially no monetary benefit to the farmer and no tickets are sold, then the farmers aren\u2019t financially worse off with a ban on jallikattu and should have no increased incentive to sell their bulls to slaughter,\u201d it said.\n\nOn the charge that banning jallikattu will wipe out indigenous breeds of bull, the group said cattle breeds in India have been changing for many years because of a variety of factors, even during the decades when jallikattu was allowed. To claim this change was primarily a result of banning jallikattu was preposterous, it said.\n\n\u201cCattle breeds are largely manipulated by humans to suit their own needs \u2013 such as increased milk production. Changes in breed do not mean the extinction of a species. Domesticated cattle are not at risk of being on the endangered species list,\u201d PETA said.\n\n\u2018PETA not targeting traditional sport of TN but opposing all cruel practices against animals\u2019",
