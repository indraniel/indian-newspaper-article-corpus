Sibi Chakravarthy and other senior officials rushed to the spot and held talks with the two groups.\n\nWhile the traffic was restored after the body was sent to the Sathy Government Hospital for post-mortem, there was no end to the stand-off over the choice of location for performing last rites in the graveyard in the locality, till late in the evening, local sources said.",
