But they submitted unauthenticated papers and vouchers. So, we have asked them to handover the accounts properly. Since the EC members are raising questions, we have decided to issue them a show cause notice,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the collection of information on association members under the \u2018Guru Dakshina\u2019 scheme, Karthi said the process of data collection was over and they will soon begin work on developing a comprehensive database with photos of the members.",
