Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had, on August 11, 2014, announced the setting up of common effluent treatment plants in Erode, Salem, Namakkal and Karur for small and medium sized textile processing units.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Water Investment Company Limited (TWIC) had submitted the Diagnostic Study Feasibility Report (DSFR) for these clusters to the government. After receiving the willingness and confirmation from the unit owners, the next process is the establishment of special purpose vehicle, which is registration of companies. While a park is proposed to come up at Vellakuttai in Pallipalayam, the other one is planned at Manjupalayam in Komarapalayam. The third park has been planned at Nathamedu in Pallipalayam. Names of three companies were registered under the Act as Green Cauvery Dyeing Committee, Green Cauvery General Dyeing Committee and Pallipalayam Dyeing Factory Association, which includes members from both the authorised and unauthorised dyeing unit owners. \u201cNext step is to purchase land for the company to establish the parks in the proposed villages and handover to the government for construction.\u201d",
