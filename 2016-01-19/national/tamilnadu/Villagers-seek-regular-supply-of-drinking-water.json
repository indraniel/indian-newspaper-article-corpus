    "text": "Villagers of Athalikulam of Vellore panchayat, Srivaikuntam taluk, thronged the Collectorate here on Monday, demanding regular supply of drinking water and other basic facilities.\n\nIn a petition submitted to Collector M. Ravikumar, they said that the 200 families in their village could get drinking water only from a neighbouring village. There were several problems cropping up between people of these two villages while collecting water.\n\nMoreover, there was no fair price shop in their village. Hence, they had to walk three km to get essential commodities from the nearest ration shop.\n\nBesides, the village was beset with problems created by drunk people. Despite lodging complaints with Srivaikuntam the police against such those trouble-mongers, no action had been taken to control them, they added.",
