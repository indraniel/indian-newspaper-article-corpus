Churchill, who brought the family members of the detained fishermen from Kanyakumari district, to submit a petition to Collector Sajjansingh R. Chavan here on Monday, said that the detained fishermen were hoping that their employer in Sharjah or the Indian Embassy in Dubai would come to their help but their hopes were dashed.

Only the Iranian fishermen were providing them food. If the State and Central governments did not take immediate efforts for their release through the diplomatic route, their situation will become even worse\u2019\u2019 said Fr. Churchill.\n\nThe union government must establish a separate ministry for fishermen welfare as Indian fishermen were facing trouble in many parts of the world, he said.\n\nAnother detention\n\nIn a release, Justin Antony, founder-president of International Fishermen Development Trust, said that four fishermen from Tamil Nadu, including two from Kanyakumari district, had been detained by Qatar authorities when they were engaged in fishing in mid-sea on January 7.
