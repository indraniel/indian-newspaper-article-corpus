    "text": "Roads in bad shape\n\nIn Coimbatore city many important roads are in very poor shape. The road between Sukarvarpet to Gandhi Park, are badly damaged. The condition is the same between Vadavalli to Pudur.\n\nThe corporation should take immediate steps to repair the roads.\n\nR. Hari Haran,\n\nVadavalli.\n\nMore buses, trains needed\n\nWarranted by the tremendous growth in the number of educational institutions, small, medium and big industrial undertakings and also population, numerous new housing colonies have sprung up in and around the Coimbatore city. Its growth has been phenomenal.\n\nAs such, there is urgent need for better local road and rail transport facilities.\n\nCreation of new town bus routes and introduction of suburban electric train facility- between Mettupalayam and Podanur, with halts at Karamadai, Periyanackanpalayam, Thudiyalur, Coimbatore north and Coimbatore junction- have to be accorded top priority.\n\nEntry/exit facilities and ticket booking counters can also be provided on both sides of the railway line, at all the above- mentioned railway stations to cater to the needs of the prospective passengers from both sides. Public response will be very enthusiastic, they will be most grateful and the revenue earnings pretty good.\n\nK.D. Viswanaathan,\n\nThadagam Road\n\nNot clean\n\nThe corporation is doing very little to maintain cleanliness, especially in bus stands at Gandhipuram, and Ukkadam.\n\nToilets are not cleaned, and drinking water is not available.\n\nV.
