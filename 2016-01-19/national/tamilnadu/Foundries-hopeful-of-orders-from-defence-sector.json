Tier-one industries should come in. It will take two years for orders to fructify for us. Foundries have the capacity.\n\nThe criticality will be in metallurgy. Hence, it depends on the specifications of the products,\u201d said southern region chairman of Institute of Indian Foundrymen, Nithyanandan Devaraj.\n\nHe told presspersons here recently that 35 per cent of the foundry industry was doing well.\n\nThese were mainly units supplying to the passenger car and consumer durable sectors. Foundries catering to sectors such as oil and gas, heavy engineering, construction and earth moving equipment are hit.\n\nAn area of concern is capital investments have not happened in the last one or two years.\n\nCR Swaminathan, chairman of the organising committee of foundry conference to be held here later this month, and Mr. Devaraj said exporting units were operating at 60 per cent capacity. The average capacity utilisation in other units was lesser. Investments now should be in modernisation.\n\nThe foundry sector has appealed to the Union Government to fix uniform norms for pollution control across the country.\n\nIt has also sought suggestions on measures that need to be taken to control pollution.\n\nThey added that India\u2019s annual casting production has crossed 10 million tonnes a year and 15 per cent to 20 per cent is exported. Nearly 100 foundries in Coimbatore are in the steel sector and these cater mainly to the oil and gas sector.\n\nWith drop in oil prices, there is a huge impact on the steel foundries.",
