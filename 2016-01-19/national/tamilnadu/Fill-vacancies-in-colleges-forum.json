    "text": "College teachers have planned to lay siege to the Office of Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education here on Wednesday and Thursday to highlight their charter of demands.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Monday evening, S. Subbaraju, convener of Joint Action Council of College Teachers - Tamil Nadu, said that 3,210 teaching posts in government and aided colleges in the State were lying vacant since May 2007 despite repeated appeal from teachers\u2019 associations to fill them with qualified teachers through a transparent manner.\n\nWhen the government allowed aided college administrations to fill up the vacancies in their institutions, norms were violated in appointments.\n\n\u201cAbove all, five universities in Tamil Nadu are remaining \u2018headless\u2019 for the past several months following the retirement of Vice-Chancellors. Qualified educationists with good track record should be handpicked for these posts in a transparent manner,\u201d Prof. Subbaraju said.\n\nMoreover, anomalies in wage parities and promotions should be weeded out, he said.",
