    "text": "The district units of the Bhratiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Hindu Munnani have urged the district administration to declare local holiday for schools and government offices on Wednesday in view of the \u2018kumbabishekam\u2019 of Sri Ramanathaswamy Temple here.\n\nBJP national council member K. Muraleedharan and Hindu Munnani district secretary K. Ramamurthy, in separate statements issued here on Monday, appealed to the district administration to declare local holiday at least for the schools in the island in order to avoid inconvenience to the students.\n\nMr. Muraleedharan said that school students would face hardship as police had banned vehicular traffic in the island on Wednesday when more than two lakh people were expected to visit the island to witness the consecration ceremony.\n\nThe government could consider declaring local holiday on the lines of local holidays declared for Erwadi Santhanakoodu festival and Arudhra Darhan at Uthirakosamangai, they said.\n\nPointing out that the island had 72 lodges with about 1,500 rooms, Mr. Ramamurthy said that the facilities would be enough to accommodate only a section of the pilgrims, and urged the temple authorities to open the rest hall at Rampark near the railway station for the benefit of the pilgrims.\n\nThe temple authorities had built the huge facility with separate halls for men and women at a cost of Rs. 1.20 crore, but it remained closed for the past three months. Scores of pilgrims from north India would be benefitted if the authorities opened the facility before the kumbabishekam, he added.",
