Badrian Street has been an important destination within the city for individuals and small merchants seeking to buy flowers, since 1998, the merchants said.\n\nA large number of policemen were deployed on Badrian Street as staff from CMDA locked the shutters of over 50 shops, big and small. Traders were angry at the government clampdown on small traders. \u201cWe were not given advance notice. There are over 150 traders \u2013 some have shops and others are hawkers. This will rob us of our only means of income,\u201d said V.Kumar, a trader.\n\n\u201cWe were evicted from the market in Broadway and those who could not afford to buy or rent out a shop in Koyambedu stayed back and we have been here since 1998. They have not disturbed the wholesale grain, pulses and fruit markets in Kothawalchavadi. Why are they targeting us alone?\u201d Mr. Kumar asked.\n\nDependent on these traders on Badrian Street are several hundred people like P.Bhanumathi, who buys flowers here and sells them at the Triplicane market on Singarachari Street. \u201cI buy flowers for around Rs. 750. If I manage to sell them all on a good day, I take home about Rs. 300, else my average daily income is only Rs. 150,\u201d she says adding that roadside flower sellers are dependent on traders on Badrian Street alone.\n\nM. Kaveri, a woman who sells Tulsi and other herbs, said that for flower sellers in North Chennai, it was not possible to travel to Koyambedu and get back home on time. Officials said they were acting on a specific order of the HC and the traders had no other option but to shift to the wholesale market complex in Koyambedu.",
