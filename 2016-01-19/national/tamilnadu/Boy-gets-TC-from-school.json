    "text": "S. Surya (17), son of a lorry driver, sighed a heave of relief on Monday as he eventually got the Transfer Certificate and SSLC mark list which were withheld by the management of the private school where he studied, for not paying the tuition fees in full.\n\nThe school authorities issued the two documents to him without having to pay the dues after Tahsildar (Tirupur North) S. Murugadoss held talks with them on the instructions of Collector G. Govindaraj to whom the boy gave a petition.\n\nDue to the delay in issuance of the TC, he could not continue Plus One.\n\nHe excelled both in studies and sports too.\n\nHe scored 411 marks out of the total 500 marks in SSLC despite the family faced poverty.\n\n\u201cSurya was admitted to Nanjappa Corporation Boys Higher Secondary school, after the authorities assessed the marks online, on the condition that TC should be produced within a short span of time. Since the private school did not issue the documents claiming that certain portion of the fees has been pending, his studies got disrupted,\u201d S. Malathi, the boy\u2019s mother, said.\n\nA. Palanikumar, State president of Lok Satta, who initially took up the case of Surya to the notice of the district administration, pointed out that the managements, which make huge profits from running educational institutions, should have waived off the small amount due from the boy on humanitarian grounds, considering his talent and family background.",
