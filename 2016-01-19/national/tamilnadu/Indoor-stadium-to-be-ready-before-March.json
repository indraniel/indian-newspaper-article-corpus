    "text": "Construction of the indoor stadium, at an estimate of Rs.1.50 crore, has resumed and is being executed in full swing.\n\nThe stadium will cater to the needs of sportspersons for organising shuttle badminton and volley-ball events. Its length is about 30 metres and height 12 metres.\n\nAccording to sources, the stadium will facilitate sportspersons to practice indoor games.\n\nThe work which suffered a setback for about eight months, has resumed thanks to the initiative taken by Collector E. Saravanavel Raj. It is expected to be completed by the end of this financial year. The stadium would have all basic amenities such as rooms for coaches.\n\nA state-of-the-art gallery will form part of the infrastructure with a capacity of about 100 spectators.\n\nOfficials hope that sports activities at the stadium would gain momentum as the swimming pool has not only been maintained but also beautified with lawn all around.",
