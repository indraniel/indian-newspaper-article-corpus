    "text": "The disease has caused extensive damage to \u2018BPT 5204\u2019 variety: farmers\n\nA group of farmers from parts of the district has urged the district administration to take immediate action to conduct a survey for sanctioning relief to farmers whose \u2018samba\u2019 paddy had been affected by blast disease. The disease had caused extensive damage to \u2018BPT 5204\u2019 variety which is more prone for the problem, they said.\n\nS. Thomas, one of the farmers from Nathamadipatti near Tiruverambur, said that he had raised \u2018BPT 5204\u2019 on 12 acres, pinning hopes on harvesting at least 30 bags of 60 kg each per acre. Although he expected 360 bags from his fields, he could get only six bags from his total fields of 12 acres, he said explaining the intensity of the disease on the yield.\n\nMost farmers wanted early survey of the fields, as harvest was fast approaching. \u201cEarly assessment will go a long way in sanctioning relief to affected farmers. It will otherwise be difficult for the officials to ascertain the extent of damage, once the harvest is completed,\u201d said R. Krishnakumar, another farmer of Kalkandarkottai who had cultivated the variety on six acres and who has been deferring harvest process in anticipation of relief.\n\nA. Nagarajan, state president of the Farmers Wing of Tamil Manila Congress, said that he had already submitted a memorandum in this regard about a fortnight ago and urged the district administration to take immediate action for conducting the survey.",
