Fr. L. Sagayaraj, Verkodu Parish Priest, said that the district administration was expected to hold a meeting with the organisers and various security agencies later this week to finalise the pilgrimage.\n\nApplications for the pilgrimage would be distributed from Wednesday and the pilgrims should submit the filled-in applications by February 2, he added.\n\nSo far, 48 mechanised boat owners registered with the Parish for transporting the pilgrims. The pilgrims should directly book with the boat owners by paying Rs. 1,000, which included administration fee of Rs. 300, he said.\n\nHe also warned boat owners against collecting more than the prescribed amount.\n\nLast year, 4,003 pilgrims, including 816 women and 229 children, attended the festival, and this year too they expected more than 4,000 pilgrims, he said.",
