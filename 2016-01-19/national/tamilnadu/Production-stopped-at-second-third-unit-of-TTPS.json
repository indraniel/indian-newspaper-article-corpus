    "text": "Generation from the second and third units of the Thoothukudi Thermal Power Station (TTPS) came to a halt owing to breakdown, sources said here on Monday.\n\nProduction from the second unit with a capacity of 210 MW was suspended in the early hours on Monday. The third unit with the same capacity had already suspended production after a problem developed in its generator transformer.\n\nThe second unit suffered earth fault in its auxiliary transformer and production was stopped around 5 a.m. Owing to a power-surplus situation, the Load Dispatch Centre had instructed the second unit to stop generation a day ahead of Pongal. While taking the light-up activities to resume production, the unit developed the problem.\n\nHowever, the unit was lit up at 3.30 p.m. and production is expected to resume soon, sources added. It requires a minimum of three hours to resume power generation after heating the boiler.\n\nReferring to its performance, the sources said the second unit remained functional over a 100 consecutive days for four times since it was commissioned on March 4, 1981. As regards the third unit, the defective generator transformer was getting replaced. A team, of technical experts from Tiruchi was involved in the task.",
