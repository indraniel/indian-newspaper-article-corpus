    "text": "Members of Tamil Nadu Vannar Peravai, Tamil Nadu Maruthuvar Sangam and Adi Tamizhar Peravai submitted a petition at the Collector\u2019s office here on Monday, condemning the recently released Tamil movie \u2018Kathakali\u2019 as \u201cit contained dialogues offensive to certain castes\u201d.\n\nThey alleged that there was a scene in the movie in which the man playing the role of antagonist said that the oppressed communities should continue to do their hereditary professions.\n\nR. Selvam from Adi Tamizhar Peravai said, \u201cThe villain says that a cobbler\u2019s son should remain a cobbler, a washerman\u2019s son should remain a washerman and a barber\u2019s son should remain a barber. This amounts to the moviemaker saying that the oppressed castes should not come up in life.\u201d\n\nThey later raised slogans against the director, Pandiraj, and its lead actor, Vishal.\n\nM.S. Ravichandran of Tamil Nadu Vannar Peravai said that the makers of the movie should immediately remove the offensive dialogues.\n\n\u201cOur protest will otherwise be carried out on a larger scale,\u201d he said.",
