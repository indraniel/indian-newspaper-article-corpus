We had to withdraw our argument when the DSP\u2019s explanations justified his act,\u201d a CPI (M) activist said.\n\nSuperintendent of Police V. Vikraman has brought the \u2018Goondas Section\u2019 under his direct supervision, and prepared a comprehensive database on the criminals and their activities in and outside Tirunelveli district.",
