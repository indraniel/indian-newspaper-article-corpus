The dead mother and her calf were found inside Kempakarai forest by forest personnel. The death is reported to have been of natural causes.\n\nHowever, when contacted, District Forest Officer E. Rajendran said the death may have been caused by an infection contracted by the animal perhaps at the time of delivery. \u201cThough the death is suspected to have been triggered by natural causes, the nature of infection was yet to be ascertained.\u201d\n\nThe pachyderms were autopsied in the presence of an NGO and the samples have been sent to Chennai, the DFO told The Hindu . The deaths of the elephants were hushed up and local media got whiff of the incident late Thursday evening.",
