The Water Resources Department officials cleared over 100 encroachments in Aathuma Nagar.\n\nIn Saidapet alone, 200 structures have been identified to have encroached upon the riverbed.\n\nSources in the WRD said that nearly 9,000 unauthorised structures had been identified along the course of the 42-kilometre-long Adyar river.\n\nOnce the encroachments were removed, the width of the river, which was only 60 metres near Maraimalai Adigal bridge, was expected to be increased to 200 metres.\n\nThe eviction drive was expected to be completed in a month near Saidapet, sources added.",
