    "text": "Passengers of a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus plying from Coimbatore to Erode escaped narrowly on Thursday after the bus dashed against a transformer reportedly due to negligence in driving. A man standing on the roadside, and a few bus passengers were injured when the bus swerved and hit the transformer. The damaged transformer tilted backwards towards a compound wall, and has to undergo repairs, police sources said. Fatalities would have been enormous had the transformer collapsed, sources said. Police have registered a case.",
