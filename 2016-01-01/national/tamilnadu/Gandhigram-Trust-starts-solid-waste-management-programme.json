Thummalapatti panchayat in Batlagundu block.\n\nIt is also engaged in capacity building exercise in two villages.

Shiva Kumar said that Gandhigram panchayat was not included in Swachh Bharat programme in the district.\n\nThe panchayat too did not have adequate funds for implementing the programme. So the trust had taken the initiative to motivate the community to segregate waste and dispose it ofsafely.\n\nThe biodegradable waste collected at the staff quarters would be used for making manure and non-biodegradable wastes would be sent to the trust\u2019s recycling plant manned by self-help groups.\n\nTwo SHGs had been engaged for executing and monitoring the programme. Necessary equipment and materials such as crowbars, iron basins, containers, baskets, shoes, masks and rubber gloves were given to workers.\n\nCompost yard\n\nA compost yard and a shed were established on its campus to process waste.\n\nThe trust was also engaged in capacity building by motivating communities at AD Colony and Mettur to adopt sustainable sanitation practices and facilities through awareness creation and health education, Mr. Shiva Kumar said.\n\nTwo dustbins would be given to each of the 600 households at these places. All materials and equipment would also be given to the workforce.\n\nThe trust had advised the panchayats to use plastic waste to lay rural roads, he noted.\n\nGandhigram panchayat had agreed to dig a collection pit to dump organic waste and prepare manure, he added.",
