A. Kadhar, a 51-year-old resident running a small business, says the area where he has lived all his life is the only world he knows.\n\n\u201cPeople are slowly being shifted to Thoraipakkam to government flats. Three generations of my family has been calling this place our home and now, all of a sudden, things are changing,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the government were to build us concrete homes on an elevated place in the surrounding area, we believe it will be of more help,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe locality along the Adyar river, below Maraimalai Adigal bridge, is now nothing but a sight of broken houses, children playing in sewage, livestock lazing in the muck and heaps of garbage. \u201cWe have four government schools, hospitals, bus stand and a railway station nearby. We are not very sure if we will have the same kind of connectivity in Thoraipakkam too,\u201d says A. Punitha, who lives in the area.\n\nStudents worried\n\nFor schools students, moving will be a very difficult experience. \u201cWe are getting better homes and bus passes. But next year, we will be enrolled in new schools. This will be particularly difficult as we will have to adjust to new and unfamiliar surroundings,\u201d said S. Thamarai Selvi, a class VIII student.\n\nMany residents feel\n\nit would have been better had the government built\n\nflats near Saidapet",
