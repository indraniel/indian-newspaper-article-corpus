    "text": "The proposal mooted years ago for bifurcating Erode taluk police station and carving out a new one for Thindal has not made any progress.\n\nPolice Department sources said there is no such move as of now, citing adequacy of strength in the taluk police station.\n\nThe station has the largest jurisdiction of over 20 sq.km. encompassing a huge chunk of rural areas. The jurisdiction ranges from Solar on the Karur Road to Mettukadai along Perundurai Road.\n\nGoing on night rounds is an ordeal for the personnel, since at least a few hours is required to cover the length and breadth even for peripheral patrolling.\n\nThough the sanctioned strength of personnel is posted, a good number of them are deployed for bandobust and other purposes.\n\nHence, those who go on night rounds have to report in the mornings as well.\n\nMurder for gain incidents have been reported on a periodic basis in the extension areas in the jurisdiction of taluk police station.\n\nFriends of Police\n\nThough the system of Friends of Police whereby local youth are drawn to assist in patrolling activities was initiated years back, it needs to be activated further to strengthen policing, sources said.\n\nThe Thindal police station has the largest jurisdiction of over 20 sq.km.",
