Annadurai, once described Thiruloga Seetharam as a poet, editor and Bharati scholar and another Athisaya Manithar of Akkirakaram (wonder man of Agraharam) . The DMK founder had earlier given the title to freedom fighter and writer Va. Ramasamy.\n\nNow, a documentary on Seetharam explains how he used music as a form to propagate the songs of Subramania Bharati.\n\nThe documentary, Thiruloga Seetharam Enkira Aalumai , by writer Ravi Subramaniam offers glimpses into a life of a school dropout who later inspired a generation of writers. Seetharam would mono act the entire Panchali Sabatham.\n\nEven though Va. Ramasamy, communist leader P. Jeevanandam, Thiruloga Seetharam and Jayakanthan popularised the songs of Bharati, Seetharam declared himself the adopted son of Bharati\u2019s widow Chellamma.\n\n\u201cWhen he learnt Chellamma was not well, he immediately left his family to take care of her. He served her for three months. Lying on his lap, she breathed her last,\u201d said T.N. Ramachandaran, a disciple of Seetharam and an expert on Sekkizhar, the author of Periyapuranam.\n\nSeetharam was forced to work as a purohit to earn a livelihood after the death of his father.\n\nHe learnt Tamil and poetry from Andhakakavi Ramasamy Padayachi, a visually challenged scholar in Thondamanthurai in Tiruchi.\n\nHe had to read out literary works to his teacher and in the process learnt by heart thousands of poems.\n\nAs the editor of the literary magazine Sivaji, he encouraged young writers and Sujatha\u2019s first short story appeared in the magazine.\n\nLate Tamil writer T. Janakiraman once said three writers \u2014 Ku.Pa. Rajagopalan, Na. Pitchamurthy and Seetharam \u2014 whose mother tongue was Telugu made immense contribution to the development of modern Tamil literature. He also translated into Tamil, Nobel laureate Hermann Hesse\u2019s Siddartha.\n\nThough a nationalist, he maintained a close relationship with Bharathidasan and even mobilised funds to provide financial assistance.\n\nHe would render Bharathidasan\u2019s Kudumba Vilakku set to music.\n\n\u201cI am yet to come across a person who could excel in poetry reading,\u201d said writer Ashokamitran, who had attended Seetharam\u2019s poetry reading sessions.\n\nHe always faced a financial crisis.\n\nOnce when Bharati\u2019s daughter Thangamma Bharati asked him whether the situation had improved, Seetharam said, \u201cOf course. Once I struggled for five rupees and ten rupees and now I am struggling for fifty and hundred,\u2019\u201d he quipped.\n\nIt offers glimpses of a school dropout who inspired a generation of writers",
