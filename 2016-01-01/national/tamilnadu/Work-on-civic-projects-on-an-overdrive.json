Work on more than 4,000 interior roads will take place round the clock. More than 163 bus route roads will receive a makeover once traffic clearance is obtained,\u201d said an official.\n\nIn addition to resuming works disrupted due to floods, the Corporation will take up relaying of damaged roads. Tender for relaying at least 105 bus route roads at Rs. 65 crore will be finalised on January 7. The Chennai Corporation had relaid more than 180 bus routes ahead of the monsoon.\n\nAs part of the preparations for the Global Investors Meet, Chennai Corporation and other agencies started a major road makeover project along 194 stretches a few months ago and decided to give priority to a few bus routes, interior roads and highways.\n\nThe civic body is yet to announce action against contractors who carried out shoddy work on bus routes and interior roads relaid recently. Many interior roads damaged have been identified in Triplicane, Mylapore, MRC Nagar, Nandambakkam, Ambattur, Valasaravakkam, Kodambakkam and Tondiarpet. Work on stormwater drains along roads that were shelved a few years ago have resumed after the floods.\n\nCorporation set a deadline of February 29 for completion of disrupted civic\n\nworks",
