Sasivarma zipping along the highways on his two-wheeler, either heading out from, or returning to, his home in Kanyakumari. His artworks don\u2019t travel with him \u2013 his most recent paintings have been done on the walls of Srirangam\u2019s Butterfly Park and those of the tourist centre at the Pachamalai Nature Reserve \u2013 but he is rarely without his basic kit of brush and paints.\n\n\u201cI have wandered from place to place looking for art lessons,\u201d says Sasivarma, who comes from an agricultural family. Interested in drawing from a very young age, Sasivarma, 36, says he knows over a thousand crafts apart from painting. And though it is difficult to independently verify this, he speaks knowledgeably about sand sculpture, Tanjore art, Warli painting, matchstick model-making and chalk carving, while showing samples of his drawings on wildlife.\n\nWith little formal training, except a two-month stint with a master who taught him how to mix colours and a correspondence course (\u201cjust for the certificate,\u201d he admits), Sasivarma has made his own fortune, based on his artistic talent.\n\n\u201cI had to become more serious after I became a family man, so I\u2019ve stopped some of the fancier crafts like matchstick models. I offer personal art tuition to 38 students in Nagercoil,\u201d he says.\n\nFor the past year, he has been commuting between Kanyakumari and Tiruchi while working on the Butterfly Park and Pachamalai reserve projects for the Government. What\u2019s the difference between working on a wall and a smaller canvas or board? \u201cWalls are easier to paint, once you scrub them down and give them a coat of primer,\u201d says Sasivarma. \u201cSmaller surfaces take longer to prepare.\u201d\n\nAnd what if he goofs up? \u201cMistakes can be corrected easily in big drawings,\u201d says Sasivarma breezily. \u201cOnly I will know where the correction was made, not the viewer.\u201d\n\nPreferring not to replicate Nature scenes from photographs, he says he is more comfortable using his imagination. Many of the Nature scenes that visitors can see in the Butterfly Park are his handiwork. Sasivarma also has created three-dimensional sculptures of animals on the walls of the Pachamalai tourist centre, which seem to mimic the real wildlife in the area.\n\nAn expert in homeopathy, Sasivarma coaches women\u2019s self-help groups in making easily marketable herbal products such as a shampoo with a curry leaf base. \u201cI studied homeopathy formally for six months, and also combined my mother\u2019s knowledge of home remedies. It\u2019s quite possible for women to earn a livelihood using the resources available to them,\u201d says Sasivarma.\n\nWith plans to offer art classes in Tiruchi in the near future, Sasivarma hopes the city\u2019s residents would stop defacing the walls with posters and graffiti and adorn them with beautiful paintings instead. \u201cWe can create beauty anywhere, but we should have the will to look after it,\u201d he says.",
