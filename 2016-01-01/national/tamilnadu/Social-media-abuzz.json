Balaji, a singer, showed over 200 hoardings and banners installed on either side of the 4-km stretch from Kotturpuram to Tidel Park.\n\nIn a post accompanying the video, he says:\n\n\u201cThis is not an anti-political video, just a (sic) frustration of a Chennai lover, seeing his beautiful city turn into a poster board.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, there was a steady flow of Twitter updates right from the traffic situation to concerns about the number of banners affecting traffic.\n\nThe banners which were a hindrance to pedestrians and motorists on TTK Road and hoardings encroaching pavements near the Kotturpuram junction became a topic of discussion.\n\nThe AIADMK itself tweeted out a number of photos of the council meeting from its official, verified handle (@AIADMKOfficial).",
