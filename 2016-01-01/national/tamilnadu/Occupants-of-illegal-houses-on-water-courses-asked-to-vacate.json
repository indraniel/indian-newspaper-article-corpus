A warning board to this effect was installed by the department recently and those who do not comply with the announcement would be evicted, officials said.\n\nShopkeepers in the area recalled that in July, eviction notices were issued to 1,289 families, which gave the residents 21 days to vacate, but there was no follow up. Residents said that they had paid between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 2 lakh to purchase plots and were even issued ration and voter identity cards. They were also provided with water and power supply by the local body and other government agencies.\n\nThey wondered why the government agencies were initiating action all of a sudden. A resident pointed out that the notice board was not clear on the extent of land encroached by commercial establishments too.\n\nWater Resources Department officials said they had not violated any rules and were acting only on orders from the High Court, which had directed them to address the problem of encroachments on waterbodies.\n\nNotices to families living there were issued twice, over the past 48 months, under provisions of the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act, 2007.\n\nEncroachments under survey numbers 46/1A1, 38B and 42B would be completely removed, the official said.",
