    "text": "A group of educationists from Tamil Nadu that submitted its recommendations before a committee set up to draft the new education policy wants reforms to be put in place.\n\nThe group of 10 educationists, including representatives from schools and universities, representing Education Promotion Society for India (EPSI), met the chairperson of the drafting committee, T.S.R. Subramanian, on Monday in New Delhi and offered their suggestions. The six-page recommendation has called for opening more schools and increasing capacity in primary and elementary level. It has called for transparency in transfer and recruitment policy of teachers employed by the government.\n\nQuality suffered as private schools lived in fear of punitive action. Instead, private schools should be allowed to fix their own fee structure .\n\n\u201cWhile reforms were made in business and industry in 1991, education was left out. This is the first time we are expecting a major change,\u201d said G. Viswanathan, EPSI president.\n\n\u201cWe want expansion of higher education. To prevent capitation and corruption, there should be total transparency in the education sector. We want autonomy for schools and colleges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are 30 different boards in the country, but among them the best is the CBSE. Yet, it is almost impossible for the schools to migrate from State board to CBSE as the States do not give a no-objection certificate easily,\u201d he added.\n\nSubmit recommendations before panel set up to draft new education policy",
