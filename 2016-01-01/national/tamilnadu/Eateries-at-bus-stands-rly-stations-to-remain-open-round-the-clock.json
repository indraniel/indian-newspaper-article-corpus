Amalraj made this announcement on Thursday.\n\nHe said that the permission was given to make refreshment available to those arriving or leaving Coimbatore at late night.\n\nBefore the serial bomb blasts in the city in 1998, shops were permitted to be open till midnight.\n\nAfter the blast, the police brought down the deadline to 10 p.m. Following representations from traders\u2019 bodies, it was revised to 11 p.m. about 13 years ago.\n\nBut, this deadline was not enough as travellers at night had a tough time to get something to eat or drink.\n\nTravellers from other districts and States were also affected.\n\nNow, after studying the situation, the Police Commissioner gave a direction to the law and order stations in the city under whose jurisdiction bus stands and railway stations are located to allow shops to remain open beyond midnight from the New Year.\n\nWith this, bakeries and hotels at the bus stands at Gandhipuram, Singanallur, Ukkadam and on Mettupalayam Road and at the Railway Junction, North Coimbatore Junction and Podanur Junction will remain open.\n\nMr. Amalraj said that special squads would be patrolling at the bus stands and railways stations to monitor movement of people and to ensure that the situation was under control.\n\nThe police were also planning to install CCTV cameras in those areas.",
