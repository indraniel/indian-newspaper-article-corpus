    "text": "Even as the authorities began the much needed patch up works on badly damaged roads in Tiruchi city so as to bring them back to motorable condition, rural roads continue to pose trouble to motorists.\n\nSimilar to the city roads, most of the rural roads were also badly damaged in the recent rains. Many of them have almost become unfit for motorable.\n\nThe National Highway from Tiruchi to Namakkal, which is one of the busiest roads, and the road from Nochiam on the outskirts of Tiruchi to Uppilliyapuram, has been in a bad condition for long. Roads have developed pits which are two to three feet deep at vantage spots rendering them unsafe for movement of vehicles including two-wheelers. Innumerable pits have been developed at various spots. Several potholes have come up in different places.\n\nThe stretch between Nochiam and Mannachanallur is the worst hit. The bitumen layer of the roads has eroded completely. The big potholes and uneven roads have made life miserable for motorists. They find it extremely difficult to negotiate the vehicles, forcing them to slow down buses, small vehicles and others.\n\nMotorists complain that the authorities, who mainly concentrate on important roads, have been following different yardstick in repairing the rural roads.\n\n\u201cMany rural roads have become unfit for cars. The bad roads are giving tough time to the drivers of buses and trucks too,\u201d said a cab driver.\n\nBesides causing severe damage to the key parts of vehicles, the poor roads had been consuming excess fuel. Moreover, the passengers were experiencing harrowing time. Hence, the National Highways, State Highways and other agencies concerned should take immediate steps to restore all damaged roads at least temporarily, he said.",
