    "text": "The Madras High Court has upheld the decision of the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board to reject the candidature of a Sub Inspector aspirant who failed to submit the required certificates on time.\n\nThe candidate K. Amutha approached the court with a plea to direct the TNUSRB to add her name in the provisional sports quota list for the post of Sub Inspector of Police and permit her to undergo medical examination.\n\nShe had applied for the post and obtained certificates to prove her participation in a hockey tournament in 2014.\n\nHowever, as the tournament was held five months prior to the TNUSRB job notification, her application was rejected by the Board. Challenging the decision the petitioner moved the court and submitted a certificate.\n\nAssuming the certificate to be correct, the court directed the Board to allow her to participate in the recruitment.\n\nBut on further verification by the authorities, it transpired that the certificate was issued on March 21, 2014 and the petitioner had collected it only on August 5, 2015, after a delay of over a year. The First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana said, \u201cIn view of the aforesaid facts the petitioner has to share the blame.\u201d",
