Nagalsamy, a retired member of the TNERC, said not adhering to the Merit Order system by the discom and poor information sharing by SLDC could be cited as reasons for Tangedco opting for purchasing power at a higher cost. He faulted the Tangedco officials for not exploring all available sources for procuring power at low cost.\n\nS. Gandhi of Power Engineers\u2019 Society of Tamilnadu (PESOT) blamed TNERC for remaining a mute spectator.\n\nA senior official of Tangedco while confirming that low cost power was available denied the charge that the organisation had not been following the Merit Order system.",
