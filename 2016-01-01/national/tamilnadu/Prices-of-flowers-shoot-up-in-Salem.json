    "text": "Price of flowers went up at the VOC flower market, one of the major flower markets of the western districts, on Thursday. The reduced arrival and heavy demand to celebrate New Year led to hike in the price of flowers.\n\nFarmers from Veeranam, Pallipattu, Panamarathupatti and other parts of the district bring the flowers to the VOC Market every day. The widespread rainfall has damaged the flower plants in some areas, due to which there has been a slump in the arrival of flowers. The heavy demand for Christmas, Meelad-Nabi and New Year celebrations has led to increase in the price of all varieties of flowers for the past one week.\n\nThe price of \u2018malli\u2019 has risen to Rs. 1,200 per kg. compared to Rs. 1,000 it was selling ten days ago. The \u2018samangi\u2019 flowers were priced at Rs. 100 per kg till recently, and its price rose to Rs. 120. The price of \u2018arali\u2019 remained at Rs. 240 per kg against a price of Rs. 200 last week.\n\nThe price of \u2018mullai\u2019 remained at Rs. 800 per kg; \u2018kanagambaram\u2019 Rs. 800; \u2018Kakattan\u2019 Rs. 300.\n\nThe rose is received from Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts and also from Bengaluru. The price of rose remained at Rs. 160 per kg.\n\nThe price of the flowers is expected to remain on the higher side for another couple of months, thanks to Thai Pongal festival, Maasi month marriage season, says K. Palanisamy who owns Sukanya Flower Store.",
