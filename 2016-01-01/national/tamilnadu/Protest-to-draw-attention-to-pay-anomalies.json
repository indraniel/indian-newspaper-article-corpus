P. Dinakaran, who led the agitation, said that the demonstration was to draw the attention of the authorities to the anomalies in salaries after the government passed a Government Order recently, revising the pay scales of employees.\n\nAfter the G.O. was passed in November, there were pay differences of employees who had completed 10 years of service.\n\nThe pay scales of those who had completed 10 years of service in Chennai and other districts should be equal but there were differences after the GO was passed in November, he said.\n\nNo pay parity\n\nThe agitation was also to urge the government to ensure equal pay for fair price shop employees, employed by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) and those employed by the cooperative societies. Both the employees carried out the same work but there was no pay parity, he said.\n\nP. Gnanasekaran, district secretary of the union, said that they staged the demonstration in the evening after completing their work and handing over the month-end accounts to the authorities, in order to ensure that there was no inconvenience to the public, he said.\n\nSolidarity\n\nK.
