Palanimuthu, former MLA of Attur, led the agitation. T. Rajambal, a former MLA of Thalaivasal, C. Vaiyapuri, president of the United Farmers Association-Tamil Nadu, Govindarajan, a leader of Vivasayigal Sangam, spoke highlighting the demands.\n\nMr. Vaiyapuri said that refusing to release water from both the Kariakoil and Aanaimadavu dams, despite having adequate water, was against the riparian rights of tailend ayacutdars, and also against the regular crop pattern.\n\nThe agitation was in the interest of the suffering farming community of the tail-end ayacuts, Mr. Vaiyapuri said and called for farmers\u2019 unity in this issue. He urged the district administration to take steps for the release of water from both the dams into River Vasishtanadhi. The water discharge should be continued till the water reached the tail-end areas of the district.",
