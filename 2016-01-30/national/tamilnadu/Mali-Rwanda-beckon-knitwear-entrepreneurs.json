He said that presently, Mali exports almost 99 per cent of the 6,25,00 metric tonnes of cotton produced annually to countries like India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh. \u201cBut the users of cotton in India import through middlemen which adds up to the cost.\n\nInstead, they can forge direct trade links with Mali government for cheaper access to cotton. Entrepreneurs can also set up units there due to the proximity to cotton source and export apparels to West African nations,\u201d he said.",
