    "text": "The city\u2019s failure to make it to the first list of 20 Smart Cities has come as a huge disappointment to civic activists.\n\nExpectations were running high among city residents after the city topped in the rankings in the State among cities shortlisted for being developed as Smart City by the Union government. But Thursday\u2019s announcement came as a huge let down.\n\nActivists pointed out that this was not the first time that the city had lost out on major projects and failed to get the much needed capital infusion for development of civic infrastructure.\n\nUnder the UPA regime, the city failed to make it to the list of cities that were developed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time we are losing out. It is highly disappointing to find the city failing to make the grade in the first list after all the extensive deliberations. Though the city deserved better, there is no political lobby to project the city\u2019s cause. We will soon convene a meeting of civic organisations and draw up a plan to register our protest,\u201d said M.Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations.\n\nCivic activists also hope that the Corporation would do better and improve on its proposals to get the city included in the next phase.\n\nSuggestions poured in\n\n\u201cIt is very disappointing to know that Tiruchi Corporation failed to get into the Smart City bus in the first attempt. There was enthusiastic participation from the citizenry and suggestions poured in. They need better understanding, presentation and stronger thrust to be included at least in the second list. We appeal to the Central Government to call for presentations again and prepare the second list at the earliest. The Corporation should make use of the extra time obtained to make the proposals more impressive,\u201d said S.Pushpavanam, Secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu.",
