    "text": "The Hosur Municipality staff on Friday dumped a load of garbage in front of an eatery near Rayakottai road as the owner failed to pay user charges for cleaning garbage.\n\nHowever, the action evoked mixed reactions since the eatery is located opposite the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, posing inconvenience to students.\n\nOn Friday, the municipality staff arrived at the eatery owned by Rajendran and asked him to pay the outstanding dues for a two-year period. However, Rajendran, who had recently applied for licence renewal on payment of Rs.7,000 to the municipality, had sought additional time to clear the dues.\n\nAccording to sources, after a while, the municipality men returned with a load of garbage and dumped it in front of the eatery. Attempts by The Hindu to contact Sanitation Inspector Mani failed, since his phone was switched off.",
