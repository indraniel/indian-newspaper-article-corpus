Davamani Christober, Principal, said that the library was the first big library to be set up in Tamil Nadu after Chennai. \u201cWe are really proud of the library and its heritage. We wanted to give it a befitting celebration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe celebrations would include a five-day book fair on the college premises and a two-day national conference on \u2018Digitization of library: enhancing reading culture.\u2019 Mr. Davamani said that during the book fair, participating public would also be allowed access to the library and the small museum inside the library.\n\nG.C. Abraham, Vice-Principal of the college, said that the idea of the celebrations and the conference about digitisation in particular were to kindle reading habit among the present generation of students who were more into using electronic gadgets rather than books.\n\nJ. Helen Ratna Monica, Bursar of the college, said that the college had embarked on a three-year project to digitise all the rare books in the library.\n\nN. Vasanthakumar, Librarian, said that the library also provided access to wide range of e-books and e-journals through the N-LIST programme of the government.",
