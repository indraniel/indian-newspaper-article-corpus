Otherwise, it would be of no use, said Uday Chandrakant Gadkari, president, Council of Architecture, New Delhi.\n\nDelivering his convocation address at the 32{+n}{+d}convocation of Gandhigram Rural Institute at Gandhigram near here on Friday, Mr. Gadkari said that ethical and moral education was missing in our education system. Education should not only be used to earn money but also to serve society, he added.\n\nInsisting on the importance of continuous upgradation of infrastructure in libraries, labs and workshops, he said that infrastructure development was essential for the overall development of education, and it upgraded the skills of students. Education should mould students as real thinkers with knowledge to understand, analyse and overcome the problems faced by them as well as by society. Continuous learning was essential to update one\u2019s knowledge, he stressed.\n\nIn her special address, GRI Chancellor Renana Jhabvala said that the present system of learning by heart or rot learning would put students down. Education should make students think and understand. It should be utilised to uplift the less fortunate.\n\nEducation was the only vehicle to get social justice and spread non-violence and equality, she said, and advised the students to strive to become job providers rather than job seekers.\n\nGRI Vice-Chancellor S. Natarajan said that the Ministry of Human Resource Development had been approached to upgrade the GRI as a Central university with a special fund of Rs. 200 crore for developing adequate infrastructure. About 27 cents of the land had been acquired for establishing an outdoor stadium with eight lane tracks, he said.\n\nA total of 1,349 students \u2013 58 per cent of them girls \u2013 received their degrees and diplomas. Gold medals and cash awards were given to 47 toppers.",
