    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s public meeting here on February 2 will kick-start the party\u2019s election campaign in Tamil Nadu, said H. Raja, national secretary of the party, here on Friday.\n\nThe party was engaged in talks with a few parties for an alliance.\n\nThe party would make public the details at an appropriate time.\n\nThere was no need for the party to announce its Chief Ministerial candidate.\n\nAfter Amit Shah took charge as party president, there had been a focus on the southern States, particularly those going to the polls.\n\nCorruption\n\nThe BJP would focus on corruption during the campaign in Tamil Nadu and promise a corruption-free government. It would be like the corruption-free government at the Centre.\n\nHe dismissed opinion polls as farce.\n\nMr. Raja denied that there was a link to the Union Government revoking the ban on jallikattu (since stayed by the Supreme Court), conferring actor Rajnikanth with a Padma award, and announcing Smart Cities.\n\nResignation\n\nHe sought the resignation of Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy for his alleged role in the solar panel scam that has rocked the State.",
