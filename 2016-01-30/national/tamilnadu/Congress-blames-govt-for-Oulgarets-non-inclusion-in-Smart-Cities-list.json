    "text": "The Congress has charged the government with failing to get Oulgaret included in the list of Smart Cities announced by the Centre.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Friday, Leader of Opposition V. Vaithilingam said that neither the Lieutenant Governor nor the Chief Minister had persuaded the Centre to get Oulgaret included in the list. Although the Oulgaret municipal administration received representations and suggestions from various sections on the choice of development of the city through a ballot sheet there was no follow up action. Smart city seems to be an elusive dream and has deprived Puducherry of all the advantages of development, he said.\n\nMr. Vaithilingam said that the government was only making tall promises without ensuring their implementation. Though it had promised to procure funds from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for a project of the Electricity Department the proposal remained only on paper.\n\nAlleging that the government was abetting backdoor appointment in public sector undertakings, he demanded that Lieutenant Governor A.K. Singh must immediately intervene and ensure that there was no violation of procedural formalities.\n\nAINRC is making tall promises without ensuring implementation: Vaithilingam",
