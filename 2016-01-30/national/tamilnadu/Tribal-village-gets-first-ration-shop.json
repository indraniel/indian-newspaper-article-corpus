S.R. Parthiban, MLA, inaugurated it.\n\nThere are about 5,500 people living in 33 tribal villages in the hilltop for the last 75 years. Electricity, school, hospital, road were remaining a dream for the tribal people. They used to trek for 15 km to reach the plains to buy provisions or reach hospitals, said Mr. Parthiban.\n\nIn the absence of ration shop, provisions were taken as head-load and on top of donkeys. The owners of donkeys were paid Rs. 250 for each trip, he added.\n\nIn 2011, the MLA donated Rs. 3.2 lakh from his salary and allotted Rs. 50 lakh from MLAPD to lay a mud road.\n\nThis was the first road for the tribal people who until then used to carry patients, pregnant women, and elderly people in cots and travel for over four hours to reach the foothills. Now, vans and two-wheelers are able to use the road to reach the villages.\n\nMr. Parthiban said that the funds from the Union Government would be sought for laying tar roads to the hilltop.\n\nIn September, 2015, the panchayat received theSaakshar Bharat Award for Best Performing Gram Panchayat in the country. President Pranab Mukherjee presented the award to the panchayat president, M. Vijaya, at a function held in New Delhi.",
