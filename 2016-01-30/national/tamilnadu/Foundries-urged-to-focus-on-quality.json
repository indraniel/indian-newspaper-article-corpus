Periasamy\n\nIndian foundry industry should focus on improving quality and process innovation, attract the best talent and scale-up, N.P. Thimmaiah, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Meritor HVS India, said here on Friday.\n\nHe was speaking at the inaugural of the 64{+t}{+h}Indian Foundry Congress here. The industry should see why it was not number two in foundry production, next to China. It was in the third position now. With manufacturing industries getting a boost with the Make in India initiative, the potential for the foundries will also go up.\n\nSome of the challenges for the foundries are related to quality. He urged the foundries to start treating machining as a core activity and improve quality. Process innovation should be faster. The industry should change the perception about it so that it attracts the best talent and have more innovation. Nearly 85 per cent of the 4,500 foundries in the country are small-scale. These should scale-up production capacities. In order to nurture manufacturing, shop floor discipline is must, he said.\n\nInnovation\n\nM. Ramesh, Managing Director of Caterpillar India, said industries should constantly innovate in areas such as inventory, quality, and cost reduction.\n\n\u201cWe need to see how to participate in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nTo be competitive companies should look at costs in all areas \u2013 production, logistics, etc.\n\nThe pace of change is so fast that industries need to focus on innovation and operational excellence.\n\nAccording to K. Samaraj, president of the Institute of Indian Foundrymen, the main challenge for the Indian foundry industry is welcoming and embracing change.\n\nWith the Union Government envisaging increase in share of the manufacturing sector in the GDP from 15 per cent to 25 per cent by 2025, the potential for the foundry sector is huge and it should increase its capacity 3.5 times from the current level.\n\nSome of the basic positive factors for the industry are: size of the Indian market, expected investments in infrastructure projects, and opening up of defence procurement. \u201cWe need to ponder on the issues and adapt business models that will be benefiting,\u201d he said.\n\nC.R. Swaminathan, chairman of the organising committee, said almost 1,900 delegates have registered for the conference, which has the theme \u201cNurturing Manufacturing\u201d. It will have two plenary sessions apart from parallel sessions.\n\nNithyanandan Devaraaj, chairman-southern region of the IIF, said the last two years have been significant for the Indian foundry industry. The Foundry Development Council was formed which will benefit the sector.\n\nIIF Awards and IIF Fellowship awards were presented at the inaugural of the three-day conference.\n\nRavi Sam, Managing Director of Adwaith Lakshmi Industries, inaugurated the 12{+t}{+h}Indian Foundry Exhibition on Friday morning at the CODISSIA Trade Fair complex.\n\nThe event has 300 stalls spread over 16,000 sq.mt of exhibition area.\n\nAs many as 12 countries are taking part in the exhibition, apart from group participation from China, Germany and Italy. The exhibits include low-cost automation, robots and three dimensional printing for small-scale foundries too.",
