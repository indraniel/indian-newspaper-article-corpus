It will be better if media focused on how climate change affects local communities and what can be done to mitigate the impact,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, a series of articles could have been done regarding the recent Chennai floods on the underlying urban planning issues. It is a complex story that needed to be told,\u201d Ms. Radhika added.\n\nAsserting that environmental reporting was not given the needed importance in Indian media, Ms. Radhika said that very few media houses had dedicated journalists covering environmental issues with a broader perspective.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that Indian media, unlike the one in USA, had rightly accepted the credibility of science behind climate change. \u201cIt is a good thing that Indian media is not unnecessarily focusing on raising doubts about climate change science,\u201d she said.\n\nThe training programme was organised by the School of Linguistics and Communication (SLC) of the university in collaboration with Earth Journalism Network and Internews.\n\nS. Nagarathinam, Associate Professor and Chairperson in charge of SLC, said that about 50 journalists from various vernacular media participated in the conference. He said that utmost care was taken to ensure that the training programme was organised in a carbon neutral manner. \u201cEven the invitation for the function was printed on paper produced form dried leaves,\u201d he said.",
