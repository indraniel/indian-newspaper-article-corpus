    "text": "The DMDK moved a few steps closer to deciding on electoral alliance with its president Vijayakant on Friday issuing a call for a mega rally on February 20.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Vijayakant has held such rallies before elections almost ritualistically. It is in these rallies that he usually elicits the views of his cadres on which alliance to be part of though he retains with himself the power to make the final decision.\n\nThe statement has provided a few hints and has come as a boost to both the BJP and the People\u2019s Welfare Front since that rally, to be held in Kancheepuram, has been projected as one for ushering in a \u201cchange\u201d in Tamil Nadu politics.\n\nA senior BJP leader, on condition of anonymity, said a change could only mean taking the State out of the grips of the two principal Dravidian parties. \u201cWe hope this is what the DMDK means by change. Removing the AIADMK and installing the DMK in power cannot be considered a change,\u201d the leader said.\n\nHowever, DMDK leaders refused to commit on the meaning of what the \u201cchange\u201d could be. \u201cOur leader will first ask for the opinion of our cadres. The decision will be taken after that. So there is no point in speculating,\u201d a party MLA said. Significantly, the statement did not make any direct attacks on the DMK. On the other hand, Mr. Vijayakant said the State was reeling under poverty, law and order breakdown and spiralling price rise.\n\nThe DMK, the PWF and the BJP have issued open invitations to the DMDK to join their front.",
