Prabhu\n\nAt least seven nurses, including a male and six women, who had launched a hunger strike on Friday fainted and were hospitalised on Friday evening.\n\nThe nurses were shifted by an ambulance to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and Government Royapettah Hospital for treatment.\n\nThey are part of the 10,000 nurses who have been appointed on contract by the State government. The nurses are demanding regularisation of their services.\n\nAs many as 3,500 nurses, who were appointed on contract for a period of two years, were assured that they would be absorbed once the contract ended.\n\n\u201cIt is over five years now but we have not been regularised,\u201d said a nurse from Tiruvarur. \u201cThere are others who have been on contract for as much as seven years,\u201d said another nurse. Hundreds of nurses participated in the hunger strike on Friday.\n\nIn November last, when the nurses launched an agitation, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan assured them that they would be absorbed in a phased manner as the government had proposals to upgrade healthcare facilities across the State.\n\nYet, after two months even the 400 nurses who he promised would be absorbed by December-end had not received any order, said N. Nagajothi, treasurer of the Tamil Nadu Government Contract Nurses Welfare Association.\n\nLate in the evening Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar and Dr. Radhakrishnan called the nurses for talks.\n\nAs many as\n\n3,500 nurses\n\non contract are awaiting regularisation",
