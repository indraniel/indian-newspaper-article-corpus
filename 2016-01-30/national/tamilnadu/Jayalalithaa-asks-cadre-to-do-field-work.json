In a statement to cadre, Ms. Jayalalithaa said the party was eager to face the Assembly elections backed by her government\u2019s welfare schemes implemented for five years many of which were being replicated by other States. In the last Lok Sabha elections, the entire nation took note of the party\u2019s massive victory. Similarly, she said she was strategising for the forthcoming Assembly elections and urging the cadre to take up the field work as per her plans.\n\nInitially, she asked partymen to fully utilise the weekend enrolment camps being conducted by the Election Commission (EC) on January 31 and February 6 in the State. She asked the party\u2019s booth agents to go on a door-to-door verification check of the electoral rolls. If the names of the voters who were either dead or migrated were found, she asked them to approach the booth level officers with proper forms and required documents (to remove bogus votes).\n\nSimilarly, she asked them to represent the cases of left out voters who were above 18 years of age as well as any corrections or changes in the electoral rolls as it was the final opportunity available to them ahead of the elections.\n\nMs. Jayalalithaa said she will give the cadre particular tasks which would have to be fulfilled dutifully (to enable her to return to power).\n\n\u2018Party eager to face Assembly elections backed by government\u2019s welfare schemes\u2019",
