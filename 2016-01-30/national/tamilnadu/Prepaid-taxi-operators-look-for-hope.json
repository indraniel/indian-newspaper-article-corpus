Stalin, they seek subsidised diesel, residential and office buildings and insurance\n\nWhile interacting with members of Chennai Airport Prepaid Taxi Owners-Drivers Association members at Nanganallur as part of his Namakku Naame campaign on Thursday, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) treasurer M.K. Stalin assured them that if DMK came to power, the proposal for establishing a Green Field airport would be reopened and efforts would be made to improve the lot of prepaid taxi operators and drivers at Chennai airport.\n\nSubsidised diesel\n\nMr. Stalin said it was the DMK which had set up welfare boards for safeguarding the interests of the Association.\n\nThe Association members put forward their demands, which include making diesel available at subsidised rates, construction of a residential complex and office building for the Association, addressing anomalies in parking fees inside the airport and special insurance cover for taxi drivers and their family members.\n\nAssociation secretary M.V. Sukumar said that steps should be taken for allowing bigger cars under the pre-paid category to cater to larger groups of passengers and those with more luggage. More than 1,000 prepaid taxis were operating under the government\u2019s guidelines, he said.\n\nAssociation president S. Srinivasan demanded that the Tambaram Taluk Government Hospital in Chromepet be upgraded to a multi-speciality hospital as many of the road accident victims and neighbourhood residents depend on this hospital for medical emergencies.",
