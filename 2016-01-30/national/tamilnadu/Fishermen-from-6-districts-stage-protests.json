They also demanded compensation for the damaged boats and nets.\n\nFishermen from Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram participated in the stir.\n\nWhile a section of the fishermen attempted to picket the Karaikal port by boats, another group resorted to \u2018rail roko\u2019 at Pattinachery near Karaikal. They blocked the Chennai \u2013 Karaikal Express train for about two-and-a-half hours from 7.25 a.m. The fishermen squatted on the track on the Vettar bridge near Karaikal. Nagapattinam Superintendent of Police Abhinav Kumar rushed to the spot and held talks with them.\n\nMeanwhile, another group of fishermen resorted to road-roko in the area leading to the private port in Karaikal.\n\nK. S. Palanisamy, Nagapattinam Collector, held talks with the representatives of fishermen, who withdrew the agitation later. S. N. Mohandas, a panchayatdar from Nagapattinam district, said that the State and central government should take steps to release fishermen and sanction compensation to the boats damaged.\n\nMr. Mohandas told The Hindu that the fishermen have fixed February 10 as deadline for resolving the issue failing which they would resume the stir the next day.",
