Ravindran, conservation architect, has strongly come out in favour of conserving the Mairie using traditional materials that will last and not fake history by using cement concrete.\n\nIn an interview to The Hindu , Mr. Ravindran, who also chairs INTACH\u2019s Architectural and Heritage Advisory Committee, says: \u201cWe know that for 145 years this building has stood with lime and brickwork. And we all know very well that concrete has a limited life, cement undergoes a molecular change after 60 to 80 years. In a saline moist environment, it could be shorter. The PWD should seek expertise in the reconstruction rather than take a shortcut and do a historical error, which will then crumble in 60 years.\u201d As a person, who has a long connect with the town, he says, \u201cif we think we can recreate the building using cement and concrete, it reveals a disease in our system. The moment you start faking, you are not conserving, you are just trying to tell a lie in history. That is something should not be acceptable to any citizen who has any sense of pride about the history of the place.\u201d\n\nThe building that will be reconstructed from the old foundations can be adapted to new uses. \u201cThe first principle is that the building should be seen as a public asset with public access, in which the people can enter, interact and consider as one their assets. It should not become an exclusive domain like a hotel or a government office that is closed down,\u201d Mr. Ravindran says.\n\nThe second principle is that when you introduce toilets and kitchens, you have to be extremely cautious because water is the biggest enemy to any construction. The third principle is that if they want to air-condition the building can be selectively done with extreme caution and without jeopardising the original aesthetics of the building.\n\nCiting examples of many ASI buildings and museums that have been partly-reconstructed and partly-restored and made good for re-use, he says that conservation-driven reconstruction of the building will be very much possible.\n\n\u201cReconstruction of the building using traditional materials, including lime and brick will also offer an opportunity for PWD engineers to be trained in such techniques,\u201d says the architect.",
