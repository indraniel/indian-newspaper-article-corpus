After a series of deaths of manual scavengers in Villupuram in the last two weeks, a Dalit sanitation worker Aiyaaru hanged himself in his house in Asanur Village near Ulundurpet in Villupuram district on Thursday.\n\nAiyaaru in his suicide note blamed panchayat leader Shanthi\u2019s husband Selvaraj for his death. In the two-page suicide note, he stated that since he was from a lower caste, Selvaraj forced him to do the household work, including cleaning of toilets.\n\n\u201cIf I refuse to follow his order, he would verbally abuse me. When I question him, he would say I am [from] a lower caste. In such circumstance, I feel I am unfit to live in this world,\u201d he wrote. He ended the letter with: \u2018Fear is equal to a drop of poison\u2019.\n\nAiyaaru was in his late 20s.

The police have arrested Selvaraj and booked him under Section 306 of IPC for abetting suicide and 3(1)(X) of Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act.\n\nIn the suicide note, he has blamed panchayat leader\u2019s husband",
