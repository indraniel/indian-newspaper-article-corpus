Continuing to keep them at the zoo led to space constraint for animals, birds that could otherwise be kept only in a zoo.\n\nTo rehabilitate the animals, birds and provide additional space the civic body decided to rehabilitate those, the resolution explained.\n\nThe council approved the proposal by a Hyderabad-based company to dig tunnel in Peria Combai and Kattan hillocks for Rs. 66 lakh for laying additional pipeline to carry Pilloor water.\n\nIt also decided to plan afresh the skywalk project near the Singanallur bus stand, and cancelled a resolution for buying new vehicles.\n\nMayor P. Rajkumar said that like other government departments/organisations the corporation too could go in for hired vehicles to save cost.\n\nEarlier during the meeting, the Councillors sought early execution of works that the council had already approved of, fogging to control mosquitoes, reconstruction of roads damaged during the execution of underground drainage works and rehabilitation of those families living at the Thanneerpandal Road S Bend junction.",
