And there are other civil society organisations in India that are in a similar position. The award is therefore meant to send a strong signal of support to the whole of the Indian human rights movement,\u201d said Selmin Caliskan, Director of Amnesty International Germany, in a statement.\n\nRecounting his tryst with human rights activism, Mr. Henri says that he entered the arena when \u2018human rights\u2019 was treated as a \u201cbad word.\u201d There were at least two occasions when he wanted to resume his profession as a lawyer when the government closed the funding channels. But I realised that defending human rights outside courts was my calling. When all these attacks on human rights defenders are taking place, I feel comforted that I have made the right option, though a painful option,\u201d he says.",
