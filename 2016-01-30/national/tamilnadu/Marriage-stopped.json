The boy was engaged to be married to a 21-year-old girl of the same area by their families. The couple was to be married off on Friday. On a tip-off that the boy had not yet completed the legal age of 21 years, a team led by Paapireddypatty Tahsildar Mani, and the village administrative officer, stopped the marriage. The families were counselled to wait till the boy attained 21 years.",
