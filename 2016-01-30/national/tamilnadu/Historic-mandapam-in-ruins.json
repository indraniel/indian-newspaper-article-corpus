    "text": "A 13th century-built mandpam with 16 stone pillars situated near Dharapuram is in ruins with trees grown wild around as well as atop the structure. Pillars and roof are in a dilapidated condition due to neglect.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the pillars is that four of them at the corners are \u2018musical pillars\u2019 producing pleasant musical notes when one tap on them. \u201cStudies denote that this mandapam, erected during the \u2018Later Pandyas\u2019 and \u2018Hoysala\u2019 period, was used to keep Lord Shiva\u2019s idol before being taken out on processions during the festivals in nearby temples. Besides, the structure was also used by people to discuss development and cultural activities of the village,\u201d R. Poongundran, a retired assistant of Archaeology Department, told The Hindu .\n\nA close observation of the stone pillars will show the neatly carved out sculptures of a girl playing musical instrument, Kannappa Nayanar performing puja to Lord Shiva, a cow (nandhi), a fish and a girl holding a tree branch, and some inscriptions.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed pathetic to see such a historical mandapam on the verge of disintegration due to lack of proper maintenance. Roof can collapse any moment.\n\nAuthorities should take steps to restore and preserve such monuments that by itself are the torch-bearers of history to the future generations,\u201d pointed out S. Ravikumar, an archaeologist attached to Virarajendran Historical Research Centre.",
