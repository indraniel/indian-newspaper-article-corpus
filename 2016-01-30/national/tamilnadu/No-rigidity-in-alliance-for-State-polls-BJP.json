It is also willing to be a junior partner in an alliance, said Muralidhar Rao, National General Secretary, in an exclusive interview to The Hindu here on Friday.\n\nIt was talking to a few parties, social organisations and forces to forge alliance. In the process of forming an alliance, if the party recognises the strength of the partner, it accepts the same without qualms. It was not keen on chief ministership, either. \u201cIn short, there\u2019s no rigidity as far as alliance is concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the party would soon decide on its election leadership as it very well understood the need for having one in the State where personalities mattered the most. The decision would form part of the party\u2019s election strategy. The party would decide on its election leadership also factoring in the alliance.\n\nAt present, the party was keen on projecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership and achievements. He was not unduly worried as the leadership had given the National Democratic Alliance only two seats in Tamil Nadu in the 2014 General Election. The leadership had worked for Tamil Nadu.\n\nFishermen issues\n\nSince Mr. Modi assumed office, not a Tamil fisherman was killed for reportedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary. In the UPA regime around 550 fishermen were killed. Under Mr. Modi, the fishermen were also getting periodically released from the prisons in the Island nation.\n\nThe Prime Minister had taken an aerial survey of flood-affected areas, disbursed relief and the Central Government\u2019s response to the disaster was far better than the State\u2019s. On the issue of nurturing Tamil identity and culture too, the BJP\u2019s government was far more sensitive than previous ones.\n\nBut has the party successfully carried the Government\u2019s achievements to the public?\n\nThere could be communication gap, but the BJP was trying to overcome those by forming alliance with various social groups. The understanding with the Devendrakula Vellalars was a part of this reach out. It was in talks with other communities, social organisations as well, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Rao said that BJP was also trying to occupy the vacuum created in Tamil Nadu by what he termed the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the Congress. The vacuum, the public discourse for an alternative beyond the two leading Dravidian parties, and the appeal of the Prime Minister would work in the party\u2019s favour in the coming Assembly election, he added.\n\nIn response to a question from journalists, he replied that Mr. Modi\u2019s February 2 public meeting would have a lasting impact in the State\u2019s electoral politics.",
