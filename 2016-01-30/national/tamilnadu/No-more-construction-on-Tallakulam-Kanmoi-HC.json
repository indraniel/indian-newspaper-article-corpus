James\n\nThe Madras High Court Bench here on Friday restrained the State government from allowing any kind of construction on the vacant land of Tallakulam kanmoi (tank) which was once spread over 52.34 acres in the heart of the city.\n\nJustices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran passed the interim order on a public interest litigation filed by an agriculturist who pointed out that the State had now constructed a massive building for World Tamil Sangam on 14.15 acres of the waterbody.\n\nAccording to the petitioner M. Gopalakrishnan of Sambiranipatti in Melur taluk, the tank had been destroyed little by little over the years by permitting construction of Madurai Corporation building, an Eco Park, Government Law College and other establishments.\n\nThe latest assault on the waterbody was the construction of World Tamil Sangam complex for which proposals were mooted in 1982 and the files were shuttling back and forth between different government departments for reclassification of the land.\n\nOn December 13, 1996, Madurai Corporation had resolved to permit the construction on a condition that a canal was constructed to facilitate flow of water through Karumbalai to Vandiyur Kanmoi and in 2005, the then Collector had urged the Public Works Department to change the classification.\n\nFinally, funds for the project were sanctioned in 2012 and the government constructed the building. By this, it \u201chad committed breach of trust reposed in it by putting up constructions illegally on a waterbody and seeking to destroy it totally,\u201d he said.",
