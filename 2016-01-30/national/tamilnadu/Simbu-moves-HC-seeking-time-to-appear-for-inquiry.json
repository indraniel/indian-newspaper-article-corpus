    "text": "Actor Simbu, who was supposed to appear before the Investigating Officer on Friday as per the direction of the Madras High Court in connection with a FIR filed against him over the \u2018beep\u2019 song row, moved the court seeking to extend the time to appear for the inquiry.\n\nThe actor also sought the court to modify its order dated January 11 suitably so as to protect him from multiple appearances in investigation with reference to the same offence before different investigating officers.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, he moved a petition seeking anticipatory bail in the High Court over the \u2018beep\u2019 song issue in which the court on January 4 directed the actor to appear before the investigating officer in the Crime Branch of Cyber Crime Police, Chennai on January 11.\n\nSubsequently, the actor moved another petition for extension of time in which the court directed him to appear for inquiry on January 29. But choosing not to appear for the inquiry, Simbu once again has moved an application seeking extension.\n\nFurther, pointing out another direction of the court directing the actor to appear before the investigating officer in connection with a second FIR filed against him in Chennai, the actor contended that the direction is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, as it mandates him to appear before two different officers for the same offence.\n\nThe actor wanted the court to modify the order to prevent his multiple appearances for inquiry. The two separate pleas moved by Simbu are likely to be heard on Monday.",
