Stalin on Friday said Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has to explain to the people of Tamil Nadu why the much-hyped Global Investors Meet (GIM) had failed to fulfil its promise on employment generation and investment.\n\n\u201cEven though the meet promised to generate 4.70 lakh jobs, now the State government is saying it will offer employment only for 34,428 persons. Against the proposed investment of Rs 2.42 lakh crore, it is struggling even to get Rs 13,690 crore in investments,\u201d Mr Stalin said in a statement. He said the government was putting pressure on companies to launch new units after questions were raised about the fate of the MOUs signed during the GIM.",
