    "text": "Special poojas to the animals marked the celebrations of \u2018Maattu Pongal\u2019 at various centres in the district on Saturday. Hundreds of devotees offered worship and witnessed the \u2018go pooja\u2019 at Sri Akilandeswari \u2013 Jambukeswarar temple around noon.\n\nMembers of various Jain Sangh participated in the pooja organised under the auspices of Trichinopoly Pinjrrapole Trust here. The trust has been maintaining a livestock for the past century. \u201cWe purchase the livestock particularly cows and calves from the slaughterhouses. The trust maintains 150 cows and calves which were brought for a special pooja,\u201d said P. Dinesh Jain, a member of the trust. At the end of the hour-long pooja, men, and women offered bananas, grass and greens to the animals. He said the animals were taken care of from out of donation offered by members of the public and the contribution by the members of Jain associations. \u201cOnce we purchase an animal, we ensure its total maintenance throughout. Although a number of volunteers come forward to purchase the animals from us, we do not sell it at any cost,\u201d he added.",
