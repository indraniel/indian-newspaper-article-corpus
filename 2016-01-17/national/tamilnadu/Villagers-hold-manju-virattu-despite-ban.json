The bulls would be decorated by their owners, normally farmers, with specially made braze ornaments, balloons, ribbons and their horns would be scrubbed and painted for Mattu Pongal , the second day of three day Pongal festival. Owners of the bulls would take these decorated bulls to a common place in the village for the manju virattu .\n\nFrom there the bulls would be let loose and made to run through a course, normally longest street in the village.\n\nThe bulls would go in leaps and bounds up to other end of the street. People would converge on two sides of the street to take a look at the bulls and appraise their splendour. In few instances people standing in sideways would try to touch the racing bulls. But there would be nothing that can be called taming would take place.\n\nManju Virattu was held twice\n\nearlier in Mel Chozhankuppam village",
