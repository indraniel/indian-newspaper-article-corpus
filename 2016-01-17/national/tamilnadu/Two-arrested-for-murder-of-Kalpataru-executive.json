A police source said Muthupandi and Jothi had been arrested for allegedly carrying out the gruesome murder of Venkateswarlu, a vice-president of Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited.\n\nContractor involved\n\nThe official, however, explained that a business motive was behind the murder, which, he added, had been carried out at the behest of a contractor of the company. The contractor had employed the two hitmen, who hailed from Tirunelveli. The driver of Venkateswarlu was still under detention, the official said. He added that the contractor was yet to be arrested as the investigation is not over yet. Venkateswarlu, a resident of Kumaran Colony in Vadapalani, was hacked to death by a two-member gang on Tuesday night, while he was leaving a clinic at Kumaran Colony 3rd Street. Venkateswarlu had stopped at the clinic, near his house, while returning home from his office in Anna Nagar.",
