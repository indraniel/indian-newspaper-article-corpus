    "text": "Fifteen fishermen including three from Kerala stranded in mid-sea, after the engine of their mechanised boat developed a snag, arrived safely on the shores in Malpe in Karnataka on Saturday, said P. Justin Antony, founder president, International Fishermen Development Trust (INFIDET).\n\nMr. Antony said that the engine snag was resolved with the advice of marine engineers onboard a passing ship.\n\nThe fishermen had ventured into the sea for fishing from Vallavilai on January 5. INFIDET had earlier appealed to the Chief Minister to take measures to rescue them. Meanwhile, 11 fishermen of Kanyakumari in another boat have been stranded near Mumbai. The South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF) has appealed to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Coast Guard of the Western Region to rescue the fishermen who had been stranded 90 nautical miles south west of Mumbai coast since January 10 due to a technical snag in their mechanised boat. The fishermen hailing from Kanyakumari went into the sea for fishing from Cochin fisheries harbour on January 4.\n\nAs they were unable to contact anyone due to lack of communication facilities, the SAFF demanded the union government to establish proper and effective communication facilities for deep-sea fishermen to avoid such incidents in future, Fr. Churchil, Secretary of SAFF, said.",
