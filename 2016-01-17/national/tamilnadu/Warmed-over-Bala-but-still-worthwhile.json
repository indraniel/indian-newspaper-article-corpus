    "text": "Bala essentially keeps making the same movie. He\u2019s drawn to darkness, and love is but another stop on the tortuous road to doom\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Bala make comedies? His obsession with bloodbaths may suggest he has one of the most twisted minds in the industry \u2014 it\u2019s a wonder he\u2019s not yet been snapped up as a consultant by the people who run Hell, to design increasingly vivid tortures. But his mind is also one of the funniest \u2014 he serves up jokes with a uniquely whimsical twist. Like the scene in Thaarai Thappattai where the folk artist Sannasi (M. Sasikumar) finds himself staring at a serving of rum in a bottle cap. I found myself grinning at even some of the non-jokey lines, as when Sannasi\u2019s father Saamipulavan (GM Kumar) curses his son, Nee ellaam nallaa irukka maatte . Look, it\u2019s a Bala movie. As if someone needed to say that.\n\nSome might view Thaarai Thappattai , which is set in the village of Padithurai in Thanjavur, as Bala\u2019s take on Avatharam . The storyline woven around the miserable plight of folk artists, the near-mythical end, the magnificent Ilaiyaraaja score (more on that later) \u2014 it\u2019s all here. Others may view the film as Bala\u2019s take on... Bala\u2019s older films. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, especially in the latter portions, is undeniable. But the power of his films is equally undeniable. At one point, a man likens an impromptu Caesarean operation to splitting open a jackfruit and scooping out the flesh. I can\u2019t readily think of many other filmmakers whose dialogue can make you feel violated. With Bala, the \u201cshould I watch this film?\u201d question is moot. You already know the answer.\n\nBala essentially keeps making the same movie. He\u2019s drawn, repeatedly, to darkness, and love is but another stop on the tortuous road to doom. Plus, the highly stylised performances, which don\u2019t seem to come from the actor so much as the director. Watch Sooravali, played by Varalaxmi Sarathkumar. She\u2019s marvellous, but it\u2019s still a Bala performance \u2014 in, say, the mockery she makes of the phrase thaai paasam , when her mother advises her not to drink during daytime. Sasikumar, on the other hand, plays the character like he plays all his serious characters, like he\u2019s exhausted and he\u2019d rather crawl back into his beard. He\u2019s the straight guy amidst the others (like the excellent new find, R. K. Suresh), the much-needed foil. I watched Thaarai Thappattai like I watch all Bala\u2019s films \u2014 partly exasperated, but also (for the most part) able to brush aside the annoyances because he\u2019s such a singular creator. Foremost among my issues with this director: the jagged cutaways, the oddly spliced in reaction shots, the painfully one-note villains, the utter lack of finesse. How can a visionary who\u2019s been making films for so long give us such crude frames?\n\nThen again, the Bala apologist in me wonders if this lack of polish is deliberate. Maybe this kind of filmmaking is as much an act of violence as the endings of his films.\n\nHe\u2019s doing to our sensibilities what the villains did to Suriya at the close of Pithamagan .\n\nBut then you see what he does with the \u2018Paruruvaaya\u2019 song sequence, with Sannasi carrying Sooravali like a daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s moving enough when you see these scenes as they\u2019re unfolding, but the blow-to-the-head import comes only at the end, when these images come full circle. For such a sensationalist, Bala can be terrifically subtle. Everything\u2019s there for a reason, however minor.I wish the characters had been fleshed out more. We don\u2019t feel for these social outsiders the way we felt about the quartet in Pithamagan or even the duo of Avan Ivan . We know, from the Andaman sequences, that Sooravali will do anything for Sannasi \u2014 yet, this knowledge in the head doesn\u2019t warm the heart. And some scenes needed to be more powerful \u2014 the villain\u2019s reveal, the random way in which Sannasi stumbles upon Sooravali after she\u2019s gone missing, or even Sannasi\u2019s transformation at the end, which appears to arise not so much from pages of a screenplay as bars of sheet music.\n\nI refer, of course, to Ilaiyaraaja. It isn\u2019t everyday that we celebrate a 1000th film, and the maestro rises to the occasion with a rousingly red-blooded score. Even if Sannasi\u2019s climactic transformation makes little sense from a narrative point of view, Ilaiyaraaja\u2019s score \u2014 violins, conch shells, beats that slam the brain \u2014 almost makes you buy it. The background bits are brilliant \u2014 the thavil with konnakol syllables in Saamipulavan\u2019s introduction, which segues superbly into the less-classical-sounding piece as Sannasi makes his introduction (you have reams of character development right there, in that switch); the rhythms and the thrilling pauses in the instrumental piece that plays over Soorvali\u2019s dance in the Andamans.\n\nAnd for long-time fans, there are amusing flashbacks \u2014 to \u2018Kuyila pudichu\u2019 , to \u2018En purushan dhaan\u2019. The latter plays as a ringtone in a sequence that\u2019s the exact reversal of the doormat situation in Gopurangal Saaivadhillai \u2014 here, the husband is pressing his wife\u2019s feet. Tell me again, why doesn\u2019t Bala make comedies?\n\nbaradwaj rangan\n\nThaarai Thappattai\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nDirector: Bala\n\nCast: Sasikumar, Varalaxmi, GM Kumar, R.K.
