Kalaivanan, an ardent fan of M.G. Ramachandran, built a temple in memory of the leader-actor.\n\n\u201cMany of his fans, in their 50s and 60s, from various parts of the State visit the temple at least on his birth anniversary,\u201d said 57-year-old Kalaivanan, who is working as a newspaper sub-agent in the neighbourhood for decades.\n\nAs MGR\u2019s 99{+t}{+h}birth anniversary is being observed today, the temple wears a festive look. .\n\nA community kitchen for the entire village and for fans, who come from various parts of the State, have been arranged.\n\nArdent MGR fans from Kerala, Karnataka and also from the island nation of Sri Lanka, are also expected to visit the temple on Sunday, says Kalaivanan.",
