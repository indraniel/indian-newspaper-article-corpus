    "text": "In fresh trouble at the K.S.P Higher Secondary School here which is mired in an unravelling child sexual abuse scandal, a 17-year-old girl studying in Class XII has gone missing since Friday evening according to her father.\n\nThe school arranges tuition classes for students after school hours from 5.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m., said P. Jayamoorthy, the father of the minor girl.\n\nWhen his daughter did not return at night, he enquired at the school where he was told that she had not attended the tuition class on Friday.\n\nMr. Jayamoorthy, a resident of Gandhi Nagar, said he approached the D\u2019Nagar Police Station with a complaint on Friday night.\n\nHe added that the police did not file an FIR at the time.\n\nKidnapping case\n\nHowever, Sub Inspector Nagaraj said that a case of kidnapping under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code was filed on Saturday morning. Mr. Jayamoorthy later approached the NGO Childline, he said.\n\nThe development comes even as the K.S.P Higher Secondary School is caught up in a controversy following an alleged case of sexual abuse of a student in which K.S.P. Ramesh, who runs the school, is the accused.\n\nMr. Ramesh, who is a functionary of the ruling AINRC, was booked under Section 10 of the POCSO Act on December 5, 2015, and has since tendered his resignation from the post of chairman of the Puducherry Planning Authority in a letter sent to Chief Minister N. Rangasamy.\n\nSuspicion\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Jayamoorthy claimed to have approached Mr. Ramesh as well on Friday night where he cited his suspicion regarding the involvement of one of the school teachers in his daughter\u2019s case.\n\nThe development comes even as the K.S.P School is caught up in a controversy",
