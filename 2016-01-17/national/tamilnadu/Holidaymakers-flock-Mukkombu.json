The crowd is expected to peak on Sunday when Kaanum Pongal is celebrated.\n\nA number of police personnel and plainclothesmen are keeping a vigil around the barrage to prevent any untoward incident and for ensuring safety of the visitors.\n\nPublic Works Department officials have been preventing the visitors from taking bath in the area.\n\nThe recent improvement work has been a good draw. A majority of the visitors were from Karur district. One of the holidaymakers A. Murugesan said that Mukkombu, with the water flowing nearby in the Cauvery, provided good ambience for recreation.\n\nS. Dhanaraj, also from Karur district, said he had come with his family to avoid congestion when a large turnout of visitors would throng Mukkombu on the occasion of Kaanum Pongal on Sunday.\n\nA number of picnickers wanted the train and boat club to be thrown open to public. Although a track has been laid with an artificial pond beside it, the joy ride is yet to be commissioned. Simians are patrolling the deserted tracks.\n\nImprovement in lighting and more space for parking are the other major works being executed at an estimate of Rs. 3.10 crore.",
