The AITF awards recognise contribution to French and Francophone studies in India. \u201cTranslation helps build bridges and go beyond stereotypes of people. It prevents the fall into domination of languages,\u201d says Mr. Jolicoeur. On Monday, he delivered a special lecture on Quebec literature abroad, its role as literature and in translation at Clinic Nallam here.\n\nMr. Jolicoeur, who has translated many Spanish and English works into French is also a theoretician of translation. He is known for his translation of works by Uruguayan author Juan Carlos Onetti. In his work \u2018La sir\u00e8ne et le pendule\u2019, Mr. Jolicoeur explains how it is not enough to just translate a text but also translate the author by understanding his or her mentality and mood, says Professor R. Kichenamourty, Honorary President, Association of Indian Teachers of French. The international congresses held once every few years by the AITF is a platform for networking and collaboration, says Mira Kamal, Vice-President, Association of Indian Teachers of French and Assistant Professor, Department of French and Other Foreign Languages, University of Madras.",
