We will know what movies are dropping out only on Monday. But as of now, all movies are doing reasonably good business,\u201d he says.\n\nWell-known distributor Tirupur Subramanian, who is based in Coimbatore, says that Rajini Murugan has managed to get a lion\u2019s share of the screens throughout Tamil Nadu. \u201cAs on January 16, Rajini Murugan is the clear winner. It has released in almost 60 screens out of the 150+ screens in Coimbatore area. The rest of the screens have been divided almost equally between Thaarai Thappattai, Kathakali and Gethu ,\u201d he says.\n\nThough Thaarai Thappatai has received an \u2018A\u2019 certificate and is being labelled violent, it seems to be holding on to its second position. \u201c Rajini Murugan will do well because it is an entertainer, but Bala\u2019s movies also have their share of audiences,\u201d says Mr. Subramanian.\n\nRajini Murugan seems to be doing well in the Chennai area as well, says Rakesh Gowthaman, MD of Vettri Theatres in Chromepet. However, he says that the decision to release four movies together was a bad strategy.",
