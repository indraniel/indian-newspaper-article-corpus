    "text": "There\u2019s pretty much nothing in Rajini Murugan that will even startle you, let alone blow your mind. It\u2019s everything you\u2019ve seen already, but you know the thing that differentiates stars from actors? They\u2019re able to take your mind off the silly story; they\u2019re able to make you forget that the plot is flimsy, that the songs are excessive, that the love story is regressive. Rajini Murugan makes it amply evident that Sivakarthikeyan, as he has done earlier in his career, is quite capable of making a below-average script seem average\u2026 sometimes, above-average even. Perhaps that\u2019s why dozens of little stars come together to form the title.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps then appropriate that he is named after the biggest star of them all. Rajini Murugan (Sivakarthikeyan) is so named by his father\u2019s dear friend, a diehard superstar fan.\n\nSo serious is he about his admiration for Rajinikanth that when he wishes to warn his daughter, Karthika (Keerthy Suresh), against falling in love with Murugan, he simply plays a clip of Annamalai that has Rajinikanth advising his daughter in similar circumstances. At one point, Karthika\u2019s father even says, \u201cNee oru dhadava sirichaa, nooru dhadava sirichaa madhiri.\u201d That\u2019s Baasha , of course. There\u2019s more Rajinikanth referencing when Murugan imagines himself as a rich, gracious man, and you\u2019re shown an imaginary sequence in which he\u2019s dressed up as Rajinikanth in Pedarayudu (the Telugu remake of Nattamai ), as he distributes money to the hapless, poor villagers. In another scene, he goads Karthika\u2019s father by playing Rajadhi Raja \u2019s \u2018Mama un ponna kudu\u2019. I didn\u2019t really mind any of these bits.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of such silly comedy in the film, mainly featuring Murugan and his friend, Thothathiri (Soori). Like when they test-drive an Audi and Thothathiri refers to the car\u2019s airbag as a balloon. Also, like in many Rajinikanth films over the years, Murugan stands up for Indian culture, and makes a statement against NRIs who don\u2019t find the time to visit their parents.\n\nOnly actors of the mould of Sivakarthikeyan, who enjoy tremendous fan-following in interior Tamil Nadu, could make these films work. Ponram is well aware of this, and smartly allocates quite a bit of time to romanticising Madurai\u2019s culture. Grand functions are organised when a girl attains puberty. \u00c0 la Kaadhal . There\u2019re panchayat fights that threaten to spill over into violence. \u00c0 la Virumaandi . And perhaps because Ponram also remembers his original promise of keeping the film free from violence, no scene is really allowed to get too serious, despite the presence of a conventional villain in Ezharai Mookan (Samuthirakani). For instance, just as a panchayat scene seems set to spill into bloodshed, Murugan makes a joke and the whole scene backtracks into comedy territory. In another scene, a man ends up dead, and just as you wonder if it\u2019s all becoming too serious, he wakes up. Later, a lorry is on course to running over some important characters, but at the last minute, an innocent dog comes in the way. The director allows himself to get carried away by the masala action template now and then, only to stop himself at the last minute and seek recluse in comedy. And that\u2019s one of the chief reasons I couldn\u2019t really summon too much dislike for Rajini Murugan , despite a horribly written love track in which Murugan follows the mind-numbingly mundane technique of standing outside a girl\u2019s house until she budges. In this film, he actually takes it a step further and sets up a tea shop, so he can make some money while staring at her house\u2019s windows. It\u2019s worse when the girl is shown being sympathetic towards his cause. \u201c\n\nHe\u2019s set up a tea shop just for me,\u201d she dreamily tells her friend. Oh, a tea shop. What a romantic gesture. Perhaps a public restroom would\u2019ve been more romantic?\n\nBut do not at all be surprised if Rajini Murugan , like Ponram\u2019s earlier film with Sivakarthikeyan, Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam , turns out to be commercially successful. It\u2019s on account of the star; not so much the film. Tamil cinema has, forever, been obsessed about unearthing the next Rajinikanth. Dhanush\u2019s name has been thrown up often. Simbu\u2019s name has come up too. But there may well be an underdog slowly sneaking up on them. And he can even dance.\n\nsudhir srinivasan\n\nRajini Murugan\n\nGenre:Comedy\n\nDirector:Ponram\n\nCast:Sivakarthikeyan, Keerthy Suresh, Soori, Samuthirakani\n\nStoryline:A couple of friends try to make something of their lives in Madurai",
