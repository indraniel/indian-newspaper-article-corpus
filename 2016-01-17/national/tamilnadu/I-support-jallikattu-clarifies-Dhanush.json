    "text": "Actor Dhanush, who was accused by pro-jallikattu activists of \u2018betraying a Tamil cause\u2019 on social media, has clarified that he supports jallikattu. A news report which claimed that he supported the apex court ban on the sport had gone viral on social media.\n\nDhanush\u2019s previous association with People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and he being voted the \u2018hottest vegetarian\u2019 in a poll conducted by the organisation made the report appear authentic. As accusations turned thick deluge, the actor tweeted dissociating himself from the news report and said that he was a supporter of the event.\n\nClarifying his association with PETA, Dhanush further said that he was not their brand ambassador as it was being believed. \u201cI was only awarded by them once for being a vegetarian,\u201d he said.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cHappy Maattu Pongal. Also, I never made any comment regarding jallikattu. I support jallikattu. The news that\u2019s going on is a rumour.\u201d\n\nThe actor also sought to clarify that he has never associated himself with PETA, which has been campaigning against jallikattu. Dhanush\u2019s clarification comes at a time when actor Amy Jackson is facing protests after supporting the ban. Recently, Veeralakshmi of Tamilar Vidudhalai Padai, protested in front of Nadigar Sangam against Amy Jackson .\n\nNadigar Sangam president Nasser had already said that he supports jallikattu. Other notable supporters include Kamal Haasan.",
