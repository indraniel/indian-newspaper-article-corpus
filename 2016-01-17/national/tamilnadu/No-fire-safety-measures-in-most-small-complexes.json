Lack of unobstructed path around the building hinders efforts of Fire and Rescue Services personnel during fire outbreaks,\u201d Sundaravadhanan Vinod, an apartment owner in Thillai Ganga Nagar, Nanganallur, said.\n\nSome of the residents of Ram Nagar in Nanganallur \u2014 where J. Venkataramani and his wife Sowmya suffocated to death owing to smoke from a fire in their flat \u2014 said that there had been a proliferation of apartment complexes in the suburban areas in the last decade and the smaller ones did not have a fire-fighting system in place. The residents said that the small complexes had been built on one or two grounds of land.",
