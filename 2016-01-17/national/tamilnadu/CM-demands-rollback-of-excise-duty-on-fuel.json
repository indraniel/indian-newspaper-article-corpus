    "text": "Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Saturday demanded that the hike in the excise duty by the Central Government on petrol and diesel during the last 13 months should be rolledback.\n\nReferring to the hike in excise duty by 75 paise and Rs. 2 for petrol and diesel respectively by the Centre, which followed the cut in prices by 32 paise and 89 paise by oil marketing companies on Friday, Ms. Jayalalithaa said in a statement, \u201cIt is unfair that the Central government has hiked the excise duty on petrol and diesel prices this way. This is not acceptable to anybody.\u201d\n\nSince November 2014, the excise duty to petrol and diesel has been hiked by Rs.10.77 and Rs.12.07 respectively.\n\n\u2018Not reaching people\u2019\n\nThough the crude oil prices have touched the lowest in the last 12 years, the benefit has not reached the people and the oil prices have continued to remain high, she said.\n\n\u201cIf the BJP Government had not hiked the excise duty, the petrol and diesel prices would be have reduced by Rs. 10 and Rs. 12 respectively. I have repeatedly stated that the wrong petrol and diesel fare determining policy adopted by the previous Congress-led government should be changed. Changing the policy would lead to cut in fuel prices,\u201d she added.",
