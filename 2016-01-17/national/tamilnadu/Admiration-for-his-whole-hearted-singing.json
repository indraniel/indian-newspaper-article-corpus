Ashok\n\nSandeep Narayanan sang the navaragamalika varnam in two speeds and then lent expression to Walajapet Venkataramana Bhagavathar's devotion to his guru Tyagaraja in the former's Ananda bhairavi raga kriti,\"Guruvara Mahimalu\".\n\nHe sang elaborate kalpana swarams for the second song and was ably assisted by Mysore Srikanth on the violin at the 64th Annual Music and Arts Festival of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam in the city.\n\nA gentle alapana elaborating the fine intricacies of sahana was presented by him for Dikshitar's \"Abhayambayam\". An outpouring of saveri for Syama Shastri's, \"Sankari Sankuru\" was a good variation to the previous ragas.\n\nMost rasikas heard the raga vishnupriya for the first time when Sandeep sang Tanjavur Sankara Iyer's composition ,\"Balasubramanyan padame\" and enjoyed his neraval of the phrase \"Parvati Parameswaran\".\n\nThe singer then dedicated his efforts to bring out the beauty of Simhendra Madyamam in an elaborate manner for the main song \"Kaliyu Kamitha Palatha\". Ganapathiram on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira played a number of rhythmic jatis and won applause for their solo performance.\n\nThe final pieces included, \"Nitya Ganapathi\", \"Kandanin azhagil\" and \"Kavinganul kavi\". Sandeep won the admiration of the rasikas with his whole-hearted singing and adherence to tradition.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
