Sankar on Friday. The events included traditional and folk performances, drama and music.\n\nExplaining the State Government\u2019s support to small and medium tea growers, Mr. Sankar said that the Chief Minister had increased the price for tea by Rs. 2 per kg and a subsidy of Rs. 17 crore. He also pointed out that Rs. 5.46 crore had been set aside for modernising the industry and Rs.15 crore for formation of a consortium.\n\nHe also called for expanding the marketing of value-added tea such as ginger tea and green tea, especially in the backdrop of the fall in prices of tea in the international market. Though The Nilgiris witnessed a steady and increased inflow of tourists because of the long holidays on account of Pongal, the footfall at the tea festival remained less. Officials opined that there is a pertinent need to advance the festival to the second season of the hill station to attract more people.\n\nThe festival will be on till Sunday.",
