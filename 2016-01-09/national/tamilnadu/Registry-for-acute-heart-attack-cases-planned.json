    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Interventional Council has proposed to launch a registry for acute heart attacks. The registry is necessary as only one or two per cent of those who suffer heart attacks get interventional support, say cardiologists.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that patients are brought within an hour of a heart attack or at least as early as possible. Often patients come very late, sometimes as late as 12 hours after a heart attack by which time the heart muscles have been permanently damaged,\u201d explained G. Sengottuvelu, Council secretary and senior interventional cardiologist.\n\nAccording to its president G. Elangovan, if doctors in primary and secondary healthcare centres are trained to identify the patients and transmit their ECG readings to specialists it would help prevent untimely deaths. \u201cPrevention is better than cure as most often it is lifestyle conditions such as obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use and lack of exercise that cause heart attacks. There is also a small per cent of people with congenital heart diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cardiologists say increasingly older persons who had already had one bypass are now returning for repair of grafts. \u201cThese patients require a procedure to correct the problem arising from ageing grafts. Science has advanced and we can now ensure that their grafts do not give way,\u201d Dr. Sengottuvelu explained. A specialist from Canada will discuss the success of the procedure, he added.\n\nThe Council has organised a two-day seminar this weekend in the city, which will be attended by specialists from Japan, Canada, France and Singapore, said Dr. G. Elangovan.\n\n\u2018Elders who had underwent bypass are returning for grafts\u2019 repair\u2019",
