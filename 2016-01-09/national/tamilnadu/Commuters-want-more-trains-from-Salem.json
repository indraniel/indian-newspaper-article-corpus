A. K. B. Krishnamoorthy, vice-president of the Forum, handed over the petition to the GM.\n\nG. Hariharan Babu, former member of the Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee, demanded that the Railways should extend the Tirunelveli \u2013 Erode, Palakkad \u2013 Erode, Tiruchi \u2013 Erode and Coimbatore \u2013 Erode passenger trains to Salem.

Mr. Babu also demanded steps for electrification of the entire Salem division.\n\nA section of farmers of Rasipuram, led by P. Swaminathan, educationist, presented a petition seeking steps to lay a service road on the western side of the Namakkal railway station to reach their farm lands. They said that the Railways had acquired their land for the laying the new track and construction of railway station assuring them the service road. The road had not been laid so far, and it caused much hardship to them to reach their farmlands, they said.\n\nThe Mohanur Rail Commuters Welfare Association, Namakkal district, demanded the inclusion of Mohanur station in the stoppage map of express trains, as the commuters had to travel for 25 km for the next major station. The Railways should set up a reservation counter at Mohanur station and also provide ramp facility.\n\nR.
