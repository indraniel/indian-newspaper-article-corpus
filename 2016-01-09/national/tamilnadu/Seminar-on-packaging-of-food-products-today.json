Ramasamy will inaugurate the seminar.\n\nT.M. Mallik, deputy director and regional head of the institute, said the event was organised to create an awareness among entrepreneurs in food sector about opportunities. Nearly 12,000 tonnes of packaging material was used in the country to pack food products. Only select products such as speciality paper were imported. Otherwise, the packaging materials produced in the country were adequate to meet the demands.\n\nWith better packaging, export opportunities are high for processed food, vegetables and fruits. The shelf life of these products can also be improved with better packaging, he said.",
