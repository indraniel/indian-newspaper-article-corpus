Gokula Krishnaveni (50) of Kozhinjamparai, in Palakkad, was walking near ATSC theatre on Thursday noon when two men aged about 25 to 30 years identified themselves as policemen. They said that the area was not safe and asked her to remove her jewellery weighing 10 sovereigns. They wrapped it in a piece of paper and helped her keep it in her purse. Later when she checked the purse, the paper only had stones. Based on her complaint, a case has been registered. In another incident, Ranjith (21) of Hope College was waiting at Lakshmi Mills bus stop around 1.30 a.m. on Friday when two persons claiming to be policemen, on the pretext of checking him, fled with his purse, ATM card and a mobile phone.\n\n- Staff Reporter",
