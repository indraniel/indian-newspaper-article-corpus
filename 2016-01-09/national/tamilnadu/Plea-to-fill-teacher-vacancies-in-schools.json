    "text": "Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary Post GraduateTeachers Association has urged the School Education Department to fill the existing vacancies in schools in the district.\n\nIn a letter to the Director of School Education, district president R. Ramu alleged that many vacancies in schools were \u2018hidden\u2019 during the counselling and not filled so far.\n\nHe said that vacancies existed for the post of English and Chemistry teachers in school in Erayamangalam, Mathematics in Ariyur Puduvalavu, and Tamil and Mathematics in Government Tribal Residential School in Valavandi Nadu in Kolli Hills. Also, the school in Thaneerpandal was upgraded as higher secondary school in 2008.\n\nBut the post of P.G. teacher for Tamil, Mathematics was not created so far.\n\nHence, he urged the Education Department to immediately fill the vacancies so that the students were not affected.\n\nThe letter also said that many of the vacancies were filled on temporary basis which affected the teachers in getting their salary on time. Hence, the salary release order should be sent on time apart from making the post as permanent.\n\nMr. Ramu said that teachers who joined on January 2, 2013 need to submit the genuineness certificate for their 10{+t}{+h}and Plus Two certificates so that they would be eligible for medical leave, leave surrender benefits and increments.\n\n\u201cBut most of the teachers are yet to receive the certificate from the Directorate of Government Examinations even after completion of two years of service,\u201d he added.\n\nHe wanted the genuineness certificate to be issued to all the teachers and a copy to be sent to the District Chief Education Officer.",
