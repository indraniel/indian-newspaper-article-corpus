Ravikumar has informed that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had issued notice to a fish processing unit near Tharuvaikulam as chemicals seriously affecting the environment were found in the effluents being discharged from the company.\n\nRaising this issue in the fishermen\u2019s grievance day meeting held at the Collectorate on Friday, Johnson, president of North Tuticorin Country Boat Fishermen Association, said the district administration should take steps for closing down the fish processing unit as the effluents being discharged by it were seriously affecting the environment.\n\nMr. Ravikumar said the TNPCB had already analysed the effluents cascading from the unit and found presence of chemicals affecting the environment in objectionable levels in it. Based on its findings, the district administration had recommended the closure of the unit to TNPCB.\n\nPresident of Tharuvaikulam panchayat Maharajan said the processing unit had made some technical modifications in the plant following objections from the fishermen. Hence, action might be taken against the company if effluents discharged by the company had serious chemicals affecting the environment.\n\nPresident of Inland Fishermen Cooperative Society P. Lilyraj said \u2018first preference\u2019 should be given to inland fishermen for fish culture in the ponds in the district instead of taking it to \u2018open auction.\u2019\n\nPresident of Tuticorin District Anna Conch Divers\u2019 Welfare Association M. Esakkimuthu said the incomplete fish landing centre at Terespuram should be completed at the earliest.\n\nMr. Ravikumar thanked the fishermen profusely for helping the district administration in rescuing the stranded people during the recent floods.\n\nTNPCB analysed effluents from the unit and found presence of chemicals affecting the environment in objectionable levels in it: Collector",
