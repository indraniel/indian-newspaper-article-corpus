    "text": "On the fourth day of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam\u2019s 64th anniversary celebration in Madurai on Thursday, Damal Perundevi presented a religious discourse on \u201cRukmini Kalyanam.\u201d The speaker fondly recalled how she had performed on the same stage when she was nine years old. She elaborated on the significance of listening to such discourses, describing how listening made Prahlada acquire divine knowledge even when he was in the womb. Again, it was listening to stories about Krishna\u2019s exploits that drew Rukmini to him, particularly to those elaborating his exploits in vanquishing Kalinga.\n\nAlthough the speaker\u2019s main narrative revolved around the story of Rukmini\u2019s marriage to Krishna, she highlighted the flavour of the month of Margazhi by drawing on all the 30 verses of Tiruppavai. She also drew comparisons between the divine romance of Andal and that of Rukmini.\n\nJust as Andal wrote Triuppavai in praise of Lord Krishna, Rukmini too wrote seven verses in Sanskrit to her Lord, entreating him to marry her. She also spoke on the brilliance of Vaishnavite Sri Vedanta Desigar and his works such as Sri Sthuthi, Godha stuthi, Sri Paduka Stuthi and his Prabandhams. In spite of the speech being on topics of religious seriousness, and in addition to the wealth of reference she made to a multitude of details from Bhagavatham, she also regaled listeners with pictures of modern life with humour and pragmatism. Her assertive tone, clear voice, easy flow of thought and conviction with which she narrated the stories rang true in the hearts of all devotees of Krishna, who enjoyed the experience with rapt attention.\n\nRAJALAKSHMI PADMANABHAN",
