LAKSHMI NARAYANAN\n\nWater was released from Kariakoyil and Aanaimaduvu dams in Pethanayakkanpalayam union on Friday for farm activities on more than 11,000 acres in the canal irrigation system in the blocks of Pethanayakkanpalayam and Vazhapadi.\n\nThe release of water from Aanaimaduvu dam into River Vasishtanadhi initially, instead of the canal, was marked by protest by a group of farmers.\n\nEdappadi K. Palanisamy, Minister for State Highways and Minor Ports, opened the shutters to release the water in Kariakoyil dam, in the presence of District Collector V. Sampath and other officials.\n\nThe water has been released from both the dams following persistent demand from the farming community.\n\nAbout 108 cusecs will be released from the Kariyakoyil dam situated in Pappanayakkanpatti village into River Vasishtanadhi for the initial ten days and another 40 cusecs into the canal for about a month for special wetting. This is expected to improve the groundwater table and also the water level in the open farm wells and bore wells to a big extent. The water will pave the way for farm activities on 5,716 acres in the villages of Pappanayakkanpatti; Thumbal; Idaiyapatti; Kumarapalayam; Kottavadi; Yethapur; Kalleripatti; Padaiyachiyur; Abinavam; Puthiragoundanpalayam; Pethanayakanpalayam in turn system.\n\nAmidst protest from a group of farmers, water was released from the Aanaimaduvu dam in Puzhuthikuttai village for special wetting. About 90 cusecs will be let out into River Vasishtanadhi for 11 days and another 60 cusecs into the canal for 18 more days, PWD sources said.\n\nThe release of water will help farm activities on 5,528 acres in Puzhuthikuttai; Kurichi; Sinnammanayakkanpalayam; Kolathukombai; Chandrapillaivalasu; Belur; Athanoorpadi; Kottavadi villages in turn system, an official release said.\n\nS. Satheesh Kumar, chairman, Salem District Panchayat, M. Chinnaraj, Superintending Engineer, and R. Periasamy, Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, were present on the occasion.\n\nThe agitation once again brought to light the difference of opining on sharing the water of Aanaimaduvu dam between the old ayacutdars and new ayacutdars.\n\nThe farmers belonging to new ayacut areas of Kurichi, Sinnammanayakkanpalayam, Chandrapillaivalasu and Ranganur villages stated that due to recurring drought conditions, the Aanaimaduvu dam remained dry for almost seven years. Hence, the groundwater level had gone down alarmingly, they said.\n\nThey demanded the PWD authorities to give preference for the release of water in the canal. The release of water through the main shutter in River Vasishtanadhi would benefit only the farmers of old ayacuts of the banks of the river.\n\nThe coconut groves and plantain crops situated on the elevated areas would get water only if it was let out through the existing canal system.\n\nThey demanded the PWD authorities to release water only through the canal and blocked the Kurichi road junction in Belur.\n\nOn receiving information, the police, revenue and PWD officials rushed to the spot and pacified the villagers.\n\nThe PWD officials explained to them that as per the riparian rights, preference had to be given initially for the release of water in the River.\n\nThey promised to release adequate water in the canal after 11 days, following which they dispersed peacefully.",
