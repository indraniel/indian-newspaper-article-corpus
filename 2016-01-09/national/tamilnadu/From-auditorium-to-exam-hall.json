    "text": "Watching a play can help one relax. But that is not all. Watching an hour-long play can also help pre-university students fetch 30 marks in their Kannada exam.\n\nScores of first year pre-university students thronged Ravindra Kalakshetra here on Thursday to watch the play Beppu Takkaddi Bole Shankara written by Chandrashekar Kambar. The play was performed by the Nandana cultural troupe.\n\nThe play is included in the first year pre-university Kannada syllabus .\n\nThe troupe also performs another play- Krishnegowdana Aane - written by Poornachandra Tejaswi. This is part of the second year pre-university syllabus.\n\nAbout 15 artistes are part of these performances. The troupe has staged nearly 70 shows in various city-based colleges and other auditoriums.\n\nDev Nagesh, president of the troupe, said, \u201cWe believe that watching the play will help students visualise and understand the story much better.\u201d\n\nThe troupe has conducted over 500 shows over the past 20 years on plays pertaining to college syllabi. H.S. Sathyanarayana, Kannada lecturer, Government Girls\u2019 PU College, Basavanagudi, appreciated the troupe\u2019s efforts and said, \u201cWe teach this lesson over a period of several days and there is no continuity. Watching the play will help students recall everything that has been taught in the college.\n\nNearly 400 of my students have watched the play so far.\u201d",
