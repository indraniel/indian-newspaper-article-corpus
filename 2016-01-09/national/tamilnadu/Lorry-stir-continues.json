Kalimuthu, secretary of the drivers and cleaners association, said though CCTL officials had agreed to speed up the processing, the drivers refused to relent.\n\n\u201cThey say they want the old system of management by drivers to be brought back to avoid delays. The wait on the road leading to the port is really endless,\u201d he said.\n\nSelvam, a driver, said they were fed up with not being able to enter the port with minimum waiting time.\n\nOver 4, 000 trailers carrying containers wait on the roads leading to the Chennai Port Trust every day causing traffic problems in highly-congested north Chennai.",
