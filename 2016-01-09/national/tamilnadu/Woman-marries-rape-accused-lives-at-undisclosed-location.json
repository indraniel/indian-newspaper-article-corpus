Since December 3, last year we have not seen her. We got a call from the court and they informed us that the couple registered their marriage at a registrar\u2019s office in Cuddalore on December 24,\u201d Lakshmi\u2019s brother D. Parthiban said.\n\nStrangely, after their marriage, the man was living in the same village and the woman and her child were said to be in some other village.\n\n\u201cHe has married her only to come out of the case. We are sure he will marry his sister\u2019s daughter who is living next door. Why is he living here alone leaving my sister and niece somewhere,\u201d Parthiban asked.\n\nBoth parties had reported to the Madras High Court that they had reached a compromise and were now married following which the Mahila Court in Cuddalore was directed to verify the authenticity of the marriage claim. After the couple appeared before him, the Mahila court judge, M.Selvam, acquitted the man , after confirming the validity of the marriage certificate, sources in the trial court said.\n\nDespite several attempts by The Hindu , the woman could not be reached for comments.\n\nIt may be recalled that while hearing the rape convict\u2019s plea for bail, a judge of the Madras High Court had suggesting mediation between the rapist and the woman.\n\n( With inputs from\n\nR. Sivaraman in\n\nPuducherry )",
