    "text": "Digging of deep borewells on Bargur hills by large-scale farmers for raising cash crops has triggered apprehensions about inevitable damage to flora and fauna as a consequence of over-exploitation of groundwater, votaries of sustainable agriculture say.\n\nOver the last decade, farmers who had been traditionally cultivating ragi and pulses, gradually shifted to tapioca.\n\nIn recent years, farm-owners belonging to the plains have been digging borewells to a depth of 500 to 1,000 feet to irrigate the cash crops.\n\nWarning\n\nThe practice, if left unchecked, would eventually lead to depletion of groundwater, and result in drying up of trees and grass and death of wild animals in the long run, V.P. Gunasekaran, State committee member, Tamil Nadu Tribal People's Association, said.\n\nThere is another dangerous dimension of non-tribals buying the farms belonging to the tribal communities and converting them into landless labourers, Mr. Gunasekaran said.\n\nIt was the combined responsibility of the Revenue, Public Works, Agriculture and Forest Departments to nip off the trend in the bud and remedy the situation, he added.\n\nThe State Government must necessarily step in to regulate digging of borewells on the hills.\n\nRaising of cash crops on the hills must be banned, and borewells must be permitted, with strict specifications on depth, only for meeting drinking water needs, said Sivasenathipathi, a farmer of Ennamangalam village on the foot of Bargur hills.\n\nThough water is available at a depth of 100 to 200 feet, the owners of large farms compete with one another to increase the depth of borewells.\n\nThe government authorities have turned a blind eye to the disturbing trend, though norms for digging of borewells in Anthiyur block have been specified by the National Ground Water Authority. Water scarcity during the summer months will be accentuated if the trend of digging deep borewells continues, Mr. Sivasenathipathi said.\n\nAccording to Agriculture Department sources, the old pattern of rain-fed irrigation must be revived and strengthened through construction of adequate number of check dams to make farming sustainable on the hills.",
