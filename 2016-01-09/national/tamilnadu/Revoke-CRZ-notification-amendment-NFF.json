    "text": "The fisher communities in the region have expressed shock over an amendment in the Coastal Regulation Zone 2011 Notification that proposes to allow new roads on the coast in the CRZ area.\n\nThe Gazette Notification dated December 30, 2015, among other things says that \u201croad on reclaimed surface\u201d can be permitted. That is the only addition for which amendment is made. And then the amendment goes on in detail to state that no unpermitted development would be allowed around it.\n\n\u201cThis amendment amounts to a slight on the fishermen and the traditional coastal communities. Our communities worked so hard when in 2005, the government proposed radical changes such as displacement of the fisher communities in the name of protection,\u201d said M. Elango, chairperson of National Fishworkers\u2019 Forum (NFF).\n\nThey also said such roads would definitely encourage development not only on the landward side of the road but also on the seaward side. It would make the whole coast open to all kinds of development which is against the spirit of CRZ.\n\nCall for National level consultation\n\nThe office bearers of the NFF demanded revocation of the amendment by Gazette notification on December 30 2015 immediately. National level consultation in all the coastal States should be held before making any amendment in CRZ 2011, as done earlier.\n\nThe forum also said the government should start the process of introducing a legislation replacing CRZ 2011 notification. The office bearers of the forum also warned of nation-wide agitations if the government does not meet their demands.",
