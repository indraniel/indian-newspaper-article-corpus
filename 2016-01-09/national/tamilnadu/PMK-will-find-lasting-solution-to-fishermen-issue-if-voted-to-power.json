As a Member of Parliament he had taken up the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, but more concerted efforts were needed, he noted.\n\n\u201cThe promises are not empty rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Anbumani asserted, adding he would step down from Chief Ministership if he failed to fulfil the promises within two years. Taking a dig at Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for remaining silent after writing letters to the Prime Minister whenever the Lankan navy arrested the fishermen, he said that the Centre would act only if the State government exerted pressure on it.\n\nParty president G.K. Mani and fishermen association leaders U. Arulanandham and N.J. Bose were also present.",
