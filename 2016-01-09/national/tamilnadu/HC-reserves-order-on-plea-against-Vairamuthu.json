Kailasm\u2019s centenary celebration, Mr. Vairamuthu delivered a speech in the presence of Madras High Court Chief Justice S.K. Kaul, actor Rajinikanth, former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and other dignitaries.\n\nIntegrity of judges\n\nThe petitioner claimed that in the speech Mr. Vairamuthu had cast aspersions on the integrity of judges who are on the verge of retirement. Hence, he prayed to initiate contempt proceedings against the lyricist.\n\nAfter recording the contention of both parties, a Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and P.N. Prakash reserved the verdict.",
