    "text": "Bus operators offer more SLEEPER FACILITIES\n\nMore omni bus operators introduce berths as demand goes up for long distance journeys.\n\nA few years ago sleeper berths were introduced in omni buses going from Coimbatore to Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\nThis was for commuters who preferred the comfort of berths for overnight travel. With increasing demand, bus operators have introduced more sleeper berths on more routes.\n\nNow customers can book their bus berths online.\n\nOmni bus operator S. Saravana Kumar said that most passengers preferred a berth and opted for semi-sleepers only if tickets were not available on sleeper buses. tickets were not available on sleeper buses. There are operators in Coimbatore and Chennai who have three slabs of fares for the sleeper berths in the same bus.\n\nThey say even with a marginal increase in fare, sleeper berths fetch them better profits.\n\nWhile two sleeper berths occupy the space required for four semi-sleeper seats, the upper row of berths makes up for it.\n\nHowever, it is not guaranteed that all buses with sleeper facilities are comfortable.\n\nIt depends on maintenance of the vehicle and the quality of the road. Passengers also check maintenance of the facilities before they book a trip.\n\nOnly if they are satisfied in the first trip do they opt for the same operator. A good way to decide is by checking online ratings of buses before booking a berth.\n\nM.K. Ananth",
