    "text": "The Madras High Court on Friday set aside the conditions imposed by the police restraining the cadres of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from wearing their \u201cuniform\u201d (white shirt and khaki shorts) while participating in a procession to be undertaken in Erode on January 10 to celebrate the 153{+r}{+d}and 125{+t}{+h}anniversaries of Swami Vivekananda and B.R. Ambedkar.\n\nRefusing to accept the contentions of the police that the uniform resembles that of the police and other uniformed service, Justice M.M. Sundresh allowed a petition moved by the RSS seeking to quash the condition.\n\nPolice condition\n\nThe RSS applied for permission to organise the procession from Kongu Kalaiarangam to Sengundhar School in Erode. The police invoked the Chennai City Police Act and granted the permission with conditions that the cadres should not wear the \u201cuniform\u201d and carry sticks.\n\nPassing orders, the judge observed that the similarity of the uniform sought to be projected by the police is not with reference to the uniform as that of the police force. It is a dress that is being used by the junior officers during drills and training. This dress is being used by the fire service personnel also.\n\n\u201cThere is no prohibition for using the said dress that is being used by the fire service personnel. Therefore, on facts, this court does not find the condition stipulated can be sustained,\u201d Justice Sundresh said.\n\nNoting that the sticks carried for rendering music cannot be linked with clubs, the judge said, \u201cWhen the usage is for the purpose of musical instruments, they cannot be termed as sticks or weapons.\u201d\n\nCourt rejects contention that the uniform resembles that of the police",
