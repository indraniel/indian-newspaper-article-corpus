    "text": "The State government on Friday assured the Madras High Court that the dearth of facilities pointed out by the two-member committee appointed by the court to check the maintenance of Anna Centenary Library will be attended within a month.\n\nSchool Education Secretary D. Sabitha made the submission on a PIL moved by S.T. Manonmani pleading for proper maintenance of the library. When the petition came up before the First Bench of S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, the committee filed their second additional report pointing out deficiencies in implementing the court\u2019s direction.\n\nResponding to the contention made by the senior counsel P. Wilson, who represented the petitioner, that certain key posts remained vacant and books and e-library were not created, the Director of Public Libraries said, \u201cProposals have been submitted to the State government for up-gradation of books, creation of e-library and palm-leaf sections and for renting out the auditorium, conference hall, seminar hall, amphitheatre and food court on December 1, 2015.\u201d The Bench posted the mater to February 26 for further hearing.",
