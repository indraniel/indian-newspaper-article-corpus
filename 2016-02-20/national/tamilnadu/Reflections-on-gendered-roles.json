His paintings exploring compositions with self-portrait, abstracts and paintings in more expressionistic style and he successfully moves from one style to another, mainly using oil colours sometimes acrylics and water colour. The artist through oil paintings and water colour recreates himself, time and again. Mr. Danasegar use his canvases as a \u2018statement\u2019 to prove that all are made up of the same and the same consists of all and spares nobody. The artist says that nature is not to be totally represented because abstraction is as much subjective as it can be objective.\n\nHis works invite the gaze and sight to experience rather than enjoy, to self introspect more than empathise.",
