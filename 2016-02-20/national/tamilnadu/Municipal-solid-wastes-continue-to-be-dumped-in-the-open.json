    "text": "Commissioner says awaiting sanction to construct processing plant\n\nTwo years since the private municipal solid waste treatment plant at Chettichavadi was destroyed in fire, the City Municipal Corporation is yet to find an alternative solution as about 430 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste is currently dumped in open space at Chettichavadi everyday.\n\nThere are 2.15 lakh households in all the 60 wards in the city apart from commercial establishments, marriage halls and small shops that generate more than 430 metric tonnes of waste everyday. The waste are collected and transported in vehicles to the plant in Chettichavadi for processing. But the fire at the plant on March 16, 2014 razed it completely forcing the civic body to dump the collected garbage in residential areas. Protests escalated in the city over the issue and the corporation digs a pit at Chettichavadi for dumping the garbage. However, the pit reached its maximum capacity and the civic body is left with no other option, but to dump in the open in the area. The absence of long term strategy for effective solid waste management for the growing city was felt by the public. However, the corporation had in June 2014 submitted a proposal for constructing garbage processing units and purchase of vehicles at a cost of Rs. 27.59 crore. But the proposal was revised in the past two years and finally Rs. 18 crore was sanctioned for constructing processing plants and landfill site.\n\nCorporation Commissioner K.R. Selvaraj told The Hindu that the project was sent for funds sanctioning committee and after obtaining permission, tenders would be floated. He said that the plant with 230 tonne capacity would be established along with scientific landfill site.",
