    "text": "With tribal population in the State number over 7.5 lakh, Tribal People\u2019s Council has demanded a Lok Sabha constituency to be reserved for the tribals so that they will get due representation.\n\nIn a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi, council chairman K.A. Gunasekaran said that most of the States that have substantial tribal population has its share of parliamentary seats, except Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe letter said that \u201cif the politicians had taken steps, the State would have got Scheduled Tribe Lok Sabha constituency from 2001, but they did not,\u201d he said.\n\nUppiliapuram in Tiruchi district was the only ST Assembly constituency, but it too lost its status on account of delimitation of the constituencies.\n\nThe letter said that the reduction of one Assembly seat is clear violation of Article 334 of the Constitution.\n\nThe letter said that the demand for one ST constituency is yet to be disposed of by the Commission.\n\nIn the absence of a parliament seat exclusively for the tribal people, no one is concerned about the non-implementation of the 5th Schedule of the Constitution, Panchayat Extension Act and the Forest Rights Act 2006.\n\nThere is no use of Integrated Tribal Development Programme and funding thereon under Tribal Sub Plan as about Rs. 500 crore to Rs. 600 crore remain unutilised every year.\n\n\u201cThis leads to crisis of unemployment leading the tribal youth to involve in smuggling of red sanders and other illegal activities under the clutches of mafias,\u201d he added.\n\nHe expressed confidence that the Election Commission will initiate steps to allot a constituency in the State for tribal people so that they get due representation in parliament.",
