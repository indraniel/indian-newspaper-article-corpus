They demanded special allowances for election duty.\n\nLater, the association adopted a resolution urging the State government to recruit additional village assistants.\n\nV. Chellaiah, district president of the association, said the strength of the village assistants across the state had come down from 33,000 to 14,000.\n\n\u201cWith a good number of new taluks and new districts having been carved out in the past decades, the strength has come down, resulting in overloading of work on the existing staff,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that although the village assistants played a key role in the safe transit of the Electronic Voting machine during the election period, they were not eligible for any special allowances.\n\nThe association adopted a resolution urging the State government to sanction election duty allowances for the village assistants.",
