    "text": "Upping the ante, the government employees\u2019 federation staged a sit-in protest through out the night, with over 500 women protesters taking active part, outside the Collectorate here.\n\nThe protesters employed across the departments of revenue, sanitation, anganwadis among others had been on an active protest since February 10, demanding that the government fulfil their 20-fold charter of demands. The sporadic protests over the last few months, however, progressed into a marathon strike over the last week, culminating into a sit-in-protest on Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday night, the protesters were prevented from cooking on the spot, leading to a stand-off between the police and the government employees. A point was reached, when the police seized the food materials that were brought to cook for the protesters at the venue of the sit-in strike.\n\nFollowing this, food cooked in the homes of government employees was brought to the venue and served. Adding to the already charged protests, a noon-meal worker suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the Dharmapuri government medical college hospital. This is second incident of cardiac arrest of government employee in the protest site.",
