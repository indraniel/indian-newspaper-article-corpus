While the Ministers pointed out that the announcement made on Thursday was only the first step and that it would be expanded across Tamil Nadu, Handlooms Minister Gokula Indira said the PMK had no locus standi to talk about keeping promises. \u201cWhen the PMK was formed, its founder S. Ramadoss said no member of his family would enter the party . What happened to this promise,\u201d she asked.\n\nResponding, Mr. Ganesh Kumar said if this was taken up for discussion then he might be forced to recollect comments made in the past by former chief minister M.G. Ramachandran. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go into those things,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, Minister for HR&CE R. Kamaraj said the PMK would forever only present \u201cshadow budgets\u201d and it was under Chief Minister Jayalalithaa that the next budget would be presented",
