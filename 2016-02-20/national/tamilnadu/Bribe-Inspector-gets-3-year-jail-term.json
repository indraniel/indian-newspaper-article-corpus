    "text": "Anti-Corruption Court here has sentenced an Inspector of Police to undergo three-year imprisonment for taking bribe.\n\nAccording to prosecution, S. Rajagopal of Meenakshipuram under Tirunelveli Junction police station limits had a dispute over repaying the money he had borrowed from a relative. When he reportedly failed to repay the loan with interest, his relative filed a complaint against him with Tirunelveli City Crime Branch police in May 2007.\n\nRajendran, who was the Inspector of Police, Tirunelveli City Crime Branch, allegedly demanded Rs. 20,000 as bribe from Mr. Rajagopal for not registering a case against him.\n\nMr. Rajagopal lodged a complaint with Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) sleuths. Later, when Mr. Rajagopal paid Rs. 10,000 to Rajendran, the DVAC officials trapped him on June 1, 2007.\n\nAnti-Corruption Court Judge Jayasingh, who sentenced Rajendran to undergo three-year imprisonment on Friday, also imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 on him.\n\nAs Rajendran informed the court that he would prefer an appeal against the verdict, he was granted bail. Rajendran is now working as Inspector of Police at Gandhi Market police station in Tiruchi.",
