Muthukumar, president and whole time director of Automotive Axles.\n\nHe was speaking at a conference on \u201cPump Industry \u2013 Global Perspective\u201d organised here on Friday by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Southern India Engineering Manufacturers\u2019 Association (SIEMA), and Indian Pumps Manufacturers\u2019 Association. ppearance of the product, cost, and reliability are important, he said. Several multinational companies have taken \u201chalf cost achievement\u201d as a challenge. They innovate and bring down costs in manufacturing.\n\nFurther, companies are able to achieve world class standards by creating a value system for the organisation. Every organisation should have a value system for people, products and the brand, he said. Mr. Muthukumar later told The Hindu that with Government spending on defence increasing every year, opportunities are more for the domestic manufacturing sector. Industries need to focus on quality and reliability. In Mysuru, the CII organised an event with ISRO recently and some micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) bagged orders.\n\nThe cost of spares that are imported is 40 per cent higher than the locally manufactured ones. MSMEs can supply the spares and components.\n\n\u201cToday, quality is must and reliability is an advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the advantage of a huge captive market, Indian manufacturing units should focus internally, cater to the domestic market and look at exporting at least 20 per cent of production. Companies should innovate and look at technologies that are affordable, he said.\n\nAccording to Bharat B Patel, president of IPMA, the demand for domestic pumps has improved slightly.",
