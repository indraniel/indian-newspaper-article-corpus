    "text": "Reactions to news about Freedom 251, known as the world\u2019s cheapest smartphone, has bordered on scepticism. While some have gone ahead and pre-booked the phone online, many are still surprised at the pricing strategy of Ringing Bells, which offers this phone at Rs. 251.\n\n\u201cThis sounds too good to be true. But more surprising things have happened in business. Lets wait for the details,\u201d said Vijay Babu Gandhi, co-founder of a startup firm in the city. Karthik Lakshminarasimman from Valasaravalkam, who works for a service industry, said he placed an order for Freedom 251 for his kid. \u201cThe server crashed on day one. I was able to pre-book on the second day (Friday),\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Vijay K Bysani, Vice-President, Customer Services at Home Serve, said, \u201cWhile we end up paying more than Rs. 400 for a good-quality mobile scratch guard for our mobile phone, it is unbelievable to see Ringing Bells launching Freedom 251 at just Rs. 251.\u201d\n\nBut he feels that if this takes off, it can help millions who are unconnected. If it delivers on its promises, this phone can be a game-changer in the market which is flooded with several phones that have similar tech specifications. The CEO of a mobile retail firm said, \u201cI won\u2019t buy this news till the product is released in June. Hope this is not a bubble,\u201d he said.",
