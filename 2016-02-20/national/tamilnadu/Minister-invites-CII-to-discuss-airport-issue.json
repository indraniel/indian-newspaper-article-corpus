Rethinavelu said that in the absence of bilateral air service agreements for Madurai airport, international flight services could not be operated to these countries. To a clarification from the Minister, Mr. Rethinavelu said that the passenger traffic potential to these destinations was around one lakh a year from Madurai. Thiagarajar Mills MD Karumuttu T. Kannan wanted the Centre to set up a BHEL-like mega industry on Madurai-Thoothukudi industrial corridor to prevent migration of educated youth from southern districts to Chennai and Bengaluru. \u201cIf the industry and State government support such a concept, the Centre will consider the proposal,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nCII (Madurai zone) chairman P.
