Public who had come to the Collector\u2019s office for obtaining certificates through e-service centres, revenue documents and for old age pension related queries faced difficulties. However, revenue offices in other parts of the district functioned smoothly.\n\nPatients who had to undergo tests at Government Rajaji Hospital faced minor delays with a considerable number of lab technicians taking part in the strike. Members of TN Government Lab Technicians\u2019 Association said that around 40 of about 80 lab technicians at the hospital boycotted work.\n\nHospital authorities, however, said that they had made alternative arrangements by deploying trainees to assist the lab technicians. TN Government All Pharmacists\u2019 Association said that 40 pharmacists associated with GRH and other hospitals in the district took part in the strike on Friday.",
