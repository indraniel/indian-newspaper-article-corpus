It will spread very fast due to breezy conditions,\u201d an officer said.\n\nHe said that awareness was being created among residents to be cautious in not starting off a fire in such areas.\n\nSuch man-made fires are reported every year. There have been instances of miscreants setting fire to mature lemon grass found on the hills. Such acts are committed mostly by persons grazing goats and cattle as the mature lemon grass cannot be eaten by the animals. There will be no new growth of grass if the dried-up grass is left behind.",
