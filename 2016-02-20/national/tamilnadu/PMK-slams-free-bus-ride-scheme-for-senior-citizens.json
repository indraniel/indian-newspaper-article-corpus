    "text": "The PMK\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss, on Friday criticised the scheme announced by the Chief Minister allowing senior citizens to take a limited number of free rides on buses in Chennai.\n\nDr.Ramadoss said the scheme was announced just to grab the headlines ahead of Assembly elections.\n\nHe said Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had failed to fulfil the poll promise made in the 2011 election manifesto to offer free bus passes for those over 58. He criticised the government for increasing the bus fare by 70 percent after 2011.\n\nDr.Ramadoss said the free tokens could be used by a senior citizen for a maximum of five days in a month, and instead all senior citizens must be given free bus passes, as promised in the AIADMK earlier.",
