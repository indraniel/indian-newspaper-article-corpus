    "text": "All India Federation of University and College Teachers\u2019 Organisations (AIFUCTO) has expressed its concern over a series of incidents which have occurred on New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and outside in the past few days.\n\nIn a statement, its vice-president S. Subbaraju said that raising anti-India slogans in support of terrorists and their patrons was a grave threat to national security. But the Union government should not to use it as a ploy to defame and tarnish the image of JNU, one of the most democratic institutions in the country. The internal mechanism of the university should be allowed to operate and take appropriate action.\n\nThe Central government had been apathetic to higher education in general and the JNU incidents must not be used to repress the democratic functioning of the institutions of higher learning.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the arrest of JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar on sedition charge without any substantial proof. It is nothing but a political move to malign the face of JNU and it is the direct attack on freedom of speech and a move to downsize the autonomy of universities,\u201d Prof. Subbaraju said.\n\n\u201cThe Centre must either furnish factual evidence against Mr. Kumar or release him unconditionally. We also condemn violent attacks on JNU teachers, students, media persons and their supporters at Patiala House Court in New Delhi,\u201d he said. Students, teachers and employees of JNU must fight it out to save the freedom of speech and thought, including the autonomy of higher education campuses, he said.",
