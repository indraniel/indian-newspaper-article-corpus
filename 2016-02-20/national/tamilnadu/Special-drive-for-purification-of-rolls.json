    "text": "The Election Commission has launched a special drive for purification of the electoral rolls from February 15 to 29.\n\nDuring this special drive, lists of dead electors, probable repeat/multiple entries generated from the database as well as the list of same EPIC numbers are being verified through the booth level officers (BLOs).\n\nAs per the schedule for the special drive, the meeting of BLOs with the booth level agents (BLAs) of the recognised political parties will be held on February 19 to share the list of the names to be deleted based on the verification reports. Some districts have reported that the house-to-house verification by the BLOs could not be completed. Therefore, another meeting of the BLOs with the BLAs has been scheduled to be held on February 24 when the complete list of the names proposed to be deleted will be shared.",
