Mr. Malladi appeared before the court for recording his witness. The case was adjourned to March 1 for further proceeding.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers boycotted the proceedings at the combined court complex by observing the day as a \u201cblack day\u201d to condemn the police attack in Madras High Court in 2009.",
