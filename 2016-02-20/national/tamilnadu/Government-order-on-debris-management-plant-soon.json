Siva Saravanan\n\nThe Coimbatore Corporation\u2019s proposal to end the indiscriminate dumping of construction and demolition waste in water bodies and along roads by way of a waste handling plant will get soon State Government sanction.\n\nAs and when the proposal gets sanctioned and the waste management plant operational, it is expected to take away 100 tonnes a day off the water bodies and roads.\n\nAccording to sources, the government will this week pass an order asking the corporation to go ahead and implement the project.\n\nThe corporation will then float tenders for the Rs. 9 crore project. Officials in the civic body said that the plant would have the capacity to process 100 tonnes waste a day.\n\nAt present, the city generated around 90 tonnes debris.\n\nThe Corporation would award the contract for operating the plant to the highest bidder who would also be in charge of the transportation.\n\nThe civic body had identified 20 -25 sites across the city from where the contractor would pick up the waste. Members of the public or builders could dump the waste in those sites.\n\nTo transport the waste the Corporation would pay the contractor, just as it was doing for solid waste management, the officials said.\n\nThe contractor would process the waste and produce hallow blocks, paver blocks or other materials that could be used in construction. The contractor would be in-charge of marketing the products, they added.",
