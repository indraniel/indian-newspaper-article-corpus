We ensure that the producers\u2019 associations and manufacturers of the products do not engage in child labour practices and not use pesticides or chemicals. The market involves the farmers and they form the board members of the producers association.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Fair Trade Town means that people of these towns would be given the option to make fairer choices in their daily lives, their morning cup of tea would support the tea plantation workers in getting fairer wages and their clothes would support the cotton farmers of our country in getting a fair price for their cotton,\u201d she said.\n\nBesides, the school and universities will teach the future generation how their food and trade systems work and how to incorporate social responsibility in their future professions.\n\nThe event, themed on \u2018Water Sustainability and the Fair Trade Market\u2019 was organised by the All for Water for All in association with the Fair Trade Twin Towns.\n\nAll for Water for All is organising the water festival to involve and engage all stakeholders, children, farmers, rural and urban population for integrated water resource management for a sustainable future.\n\nMany sustainable and fair trade organisations from different parts of the country have put up stalls at the Craft Bazaar. A wide range of products from fair trade including tea, spices, clothing, bags, bed sheets are available at this market. \u201cThis is to show how profitable self-sustainable businesses could be set up in any sector of trade. Also, to promote ethical trade, transparency and sustainability for people, planet and profit,\u201d said Devina.\n\nAt the stalls, you will findFairtrade India certified products like Oothu tea that supports the fair trade plantation workers in The Nilgiris, and international Pukka tea, along with PDS spices from Kerala. There are stalls with WFTO certified organisations that have products like beautiful block printed bed sheets and bags.\n\nYou can also find Mandala Apparels, which is certified, by both Fairtrade International and World Fair Trade Organisation, offering clothes for small children.

They are here to espouse the objective of establishing a conscious and responsible green consumer base for sustainable, organic and fair trade products in the twin towns of Puducherry and Auroville.\n\nIn essence, all participant of the fair trade organisations at the market will have answers to two very important questions Fair Trade Twin Towns has been asking the people of Puducherry and Auroville, \u2018Who Grew Your Food?\u2019 and \u2018Who Grew Your Clothes?\u2019",
