    "text": "Bengaluru has so far been the subject of many works of writers, historians, photographers and other creative personalities in Kannada and English. But Bengaluru Darshana , a three-volume work on the city, is perhaps the most ambitious in volume and scope of subjects covered.\n\nBengaluru Darshana , a 3,000-plus page three-volume work, brought out by Udayabhanu Kala Sangha, is being released on Sunday. It has articles from over 300 experts on various subjects, 7,432 black and white and colour photographs, besides line drawings and maps pertaining to 198 wards.\n\n\u201cThis three-volume work is certainly the biggest compared to works published on the city so far,\u201d said, Vijaya, one of the two editors of the volumes.\n\nThe sangha, founded in 1965, is bringing these volumes to mark its golden jubilee year.\n\nThis organisation had brought out a 300-page Bengaluru Darshana in 1975, which become one of the earliest publications on the city\u2019s evolution.\n\n\u201cAs that edition had its limitations, we brought out two volumes of 1,800 pages in 2005, which is still being held in high esteem by historians and authors,\u201d said M. Narasimha, founder-secretary of the organisation.\n\nContribution\n\nThe third edition of Bengaluru Darshana was taken up at the cost of Rs. 80 lakh and the Department of Kannada and Culture contributed Rs. 30 lakh for the project.\n\nThe project was initially steered by writer L.S. Sheshagiri Rao and scholar Suryanatha Kamath. With age catching up for Mr. Rao and following the demise of Kamath, writer M.H. Krishnaiah and Dr. Vijaya took the responsibility of editing these volumes. \u201cThe volumes will be of interest to historians, sociologists, academicians and ordinary people as well,\u201d said Mr. Narasimha.",
