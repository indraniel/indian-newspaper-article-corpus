Non-availability of land is said to be major reason for this.\n\nTiruvottiyur zone is a case in point. \u201cThe Fisheries Department refused to give land. The Corporation does not have any land in Tiruvottiyur,\u201d said a councillor. Residents have been requesting the civic body for sports facilities in WIMCO Nagar and Nettukuppam, but obtaining land continues to be challenge, say officials. Even after the merger, most of the documents pertaining to land earmarked for playgrounds in added areas have not been handed over by the erstwhile local bodies to the Corporation. The civic body has not tried to trace such lands either.\n\nThe few playgrounds that are found in the merged areas lack modern facilities that promote fitness and recreation. On this front too, areas within the old city limits are considerably better off.",
