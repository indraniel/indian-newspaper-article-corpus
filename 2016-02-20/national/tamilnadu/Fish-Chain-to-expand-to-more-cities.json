Majority of the investment is towards setting up the supply chain and the rest for marketing infrastructure. According to the promoters of The Fish Chain, Rajiv Jagadeesh and H. Naveen Chander, it has direct sourcing facility from about 20 harbours in the east and west coasts. A cold storage facility, of six tonne capacity, was inaugurated here on Friday.\n\n\u201cCoimbatore is a test market. We plan to expand to Bengaluru probably in April and go to Hyderabad in the third quarter. The focus is on land-locked areas,\u201d said Mr. Chander. The company has eight outlets in the city and plans to open seven more. It also plans to launch order over phone (text message of WhatApp) shortly.\n\nHome delivery is now available within 10 km radius.\n\nThe company is sourcing about 1.5 tonnes of fresh fish and sea food a week and these will be consolidated at the cold storage facility. The fresh fish is supplied to the customers within nine hours to 48 hours.\n\nIt is looking at Rs. 4 crore to Rs. 5 crore turnover in 2016-2017, they said.",
