    "text": "The International Fishermen Development Trust has appealed to the government to rescue four fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who have been fined Rs 15 lakh (QR 20,000 each) by a Qatar court on the charge of straying into the Qatar waters on February 10.\n\nThe fishermen \u2014 L. Jerald, R. Seelan, P. Wasilan and R. Thirumurugan \u2014 had ventured into sea from Dharin in Saudi Arabia in a boat belonging to a Saudi employer and were detained by the Qatari Coast Guard on January 7. The court awarded the fine on February 10, when the fishermen were produced before it. The Saudi employer was not willing to pay the fine but wanted to go on appeal against the order, the founder-president of the trust, P. Justin Antony, said in a statement.\n\nAs the process would take a long time, the family members were concerned about their future and wanted the government to insist on the Saudi employer to pay the fine. Or else, the government should pay the fine and rescue the fishermen from Qatar, Mr. Justin Antony said.",
