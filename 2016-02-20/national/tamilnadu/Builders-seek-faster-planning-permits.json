Krishnaswamy\n\nUnless housing needs are addressed, people will not have livable spaces in urban agglomerations, Housing and Urban Development Department Secretary D. P. Yadav said on Friday.\n\nInaugurating Fairpro, a three-day property exhibition organised by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Chennai, the official said it was crucial to address the housing needs of people as urbanisation was on the rise due to economic growth.\n\n\u201cSo many slums and unhygienic places are there in the city. We need to work together as a civil society and everybody has to pay for their own well-being,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Ajit Kumar Chordia, president of CREDAI, Chennai, said property prices would come down if the process of sanctioning planning permits was speeded up and appealed to the planning agencies, especially to issue permits in two months.\n\nA. Karthik, member secretary, CMDA, W. S. Habib, Sivagurunathan and Mohammed Ali from CREDAI also spoke. More than 300 projects from about 80 builders are on display at the exhibition, which will be on till Sunday at Chennai Trade Centre in Nandambakkam.",
