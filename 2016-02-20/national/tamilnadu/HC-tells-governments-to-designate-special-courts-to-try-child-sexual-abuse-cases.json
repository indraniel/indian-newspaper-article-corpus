Kaul said: \u201cIf there is any impediment it should be brought to the notice of this court. Thus, both the position of implementation and non-implementation should be placed before this court at least three days prior to the next date of hearing,\u201d the Bench added.\n\nThe issue pertains to a PIL moved by advocate E. Ranganayaki who claimed that child sexual abuse is an abuse of trust, power and authority that could create serious short-term and long-term problems for a child. Stressing the need for a separate court to deal such cases, she appealed to the court to direct the governments to establish special courts. The petitioner emphasised the importance of appointing a full time professional child psychologist and counsellor, in all the schools, with whom children can interact on the issue Ms. Ranganayaki further sought the court to direct the authorities to establish a website with database of known sex offenders and to promote the availability of child help line number in all schools. The Bench posted the matter to April 5 for further hearing.\n\nPIL moved by advocate\n\nE. Ranganayaki stressed on the need for it",
