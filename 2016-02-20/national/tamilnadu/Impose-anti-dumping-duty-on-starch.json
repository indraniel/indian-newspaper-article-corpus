Nallasami, secretary of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Associations.\n\nThe Union Government should impose an anti-dumping duty of 300 per cent so as restrict the imports of starch in large quantities and thereby, protect the livelihood of farmers here, he said. Starch is in demand for paper manufacturing industry, textile sector and for making of edible items. \u201cAdulteration is also a big factor for the slump in the demand for tapioca. Unless the enforcement agencies take adequate steps, the tapioca farmers could face glut,\u201d said Mr. Nallasami.",
