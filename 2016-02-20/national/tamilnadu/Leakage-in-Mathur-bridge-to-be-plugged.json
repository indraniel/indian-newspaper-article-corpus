Chavan here on Friday.\n\nAddressing the monthly grievance day meeting for farmers, Mr. Chavan said that survey on encroachments on the banks of Thurappu main canal would be taken up on February 26. If encroachments were found, the details would be sent to the Public Works Department to facilitate eviction. Ahead of Mandaicaud Bhagavathi Amman Temple festival, AVM Canal and its surroundings near the temple will be cleaned by the PWD authorities. Action had been initiated to remove banana plantations on the left bank of Muttom canal. Illegal tapping of water using motors from Rajakkamangalam branch canal had been prevented, the Collector said.\n\nStern action would be taken against those responsible for encroachments around Sengulam after getting the sketch from the Agasteeswaram Tahsildar. The district administration was taking steps to give an alternative dwelling site for those evicted from the bunds of Suchindram pond, Mr. Chavan said.\n\nEarlier in the meeting, it was demanded that water release for irrigation from all canals should continue till March 15. A farmer alleged that over 5,000 banana trees were damaged in the recent heavy wind in and around Killiyoor and sought suitable compensation.\n\nS.K. Subramanian, Executive Engineer, WRO of PWD, Nizamuddin, Personal Assistant to Collector (Agriculture), and Elango, Joint Director of Agriculture, were present.",
