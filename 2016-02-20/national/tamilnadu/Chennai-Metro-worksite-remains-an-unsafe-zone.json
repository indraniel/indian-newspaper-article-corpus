S. Lakshmi, a commuter said, \u201cSometime ago, I was almost about to skid and fall. Fortunately, it happened just inches before this fallen barricade with sharp rusty edges. I escaped. But when they are spending thousands of crores for construction, is it so difficult to maintain safety standards?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere should be safety officers going on inspection to check if norms are followed at any work site. Here, they should be even more careful since it is an area with public access. This lackadaisical attitude, when it comes to following safety, should change,\u201d an expert from IIT-Madras said.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), track work is currently going on in that stretch and may be completed soon.\n\n\u201cWe will take action to ensure that barricades are put up firmly and remove the materials from the road,\u201d an official said. Currently, construction work is going on beyond Alandur Metro Rail station up to Chennai airport. CMRL officials plan to put this stretch into operation soon.",
