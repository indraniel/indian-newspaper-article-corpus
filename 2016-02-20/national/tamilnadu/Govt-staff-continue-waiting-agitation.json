Though they attempted to start \u2018waiting agitation\u2019 in collectorate on Thursday, as the police security was beefed up in the campus they changed the venue. They forced their way into RDO\u2019s office and launched their waiting agitation, a form of protest in which the protesters would stay put in a office complex seamlessly till their demands are met or they are convinced by authorities.\n\nThey started cooking their food there itself. Arranged public address system and hoarding about their strike. They were there through the Thursday\u2019s night. Chief Minister\u2019s announcements in assembly under rule 110 on some of their demands failed to inspire them.\n\nThe protesters said that their main demands including scrapping of the new pension scheme remain unaddressed.",
