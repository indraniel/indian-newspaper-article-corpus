After intensifying their protest last week by blocking the roads, over 500 employees stayed on the premises on Thursday night. On Friday, they cooked food and eat it on the premises. They expressed anger and disappointment over the formation of expert committee and said that their protest would be intensified in the coming days if their demands are not met.",
