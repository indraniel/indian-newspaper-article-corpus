Ramesh, who sealed the cabin room of the theatre in Puducherry on Friday.\u2014 Photos: S.S. Kumar\n\nOfficials from the Oulgaret Municipality on Friday sealed a cinema theatre for defaulting on entertainment tax payment to the municipality. Municipal officials said Balaji Theatre located on Kamaraj Salai had tax arrears to the tune of Rs. 26.90 lakh from April 2014 to January 2015.\n\nThe government had announced exemption of entertainment taxes for Tamil feature films in 2007. It said that the tax exemption would not be extended to films with non-Tamil titles.\n\nAccordingly, the municipality issued a notice in December 2015 asking the theatre owner to pay the entertainment tax for screening nine feature films with non-Tamil titles from April 2014 to January 2015. However, the owner did not respond and claimed that the municipality cannot collect entertainment taxes retrospectively. \u201cFirst, we issued a notice asking them to pay the tax. The theatre owner did not respond and filed a writ petition in the Madras High court, which was dismissed recently. The authorities received the order copy on Thursday night and as the owner did not respond we sealed the theatre on Friday,\u201d a senior official said. Tension prevailed after the theatre owner allegedly used abusive language against the municipal officials who sealed the theatre.\n\nPolice were virtually silent even as the theatre management hurled abuses on the Commissioner of Oulgaret Municipality.\n\nA section of people who had booked tickets online picked up heated arguments with the management seeking refund of ticket amount.",
