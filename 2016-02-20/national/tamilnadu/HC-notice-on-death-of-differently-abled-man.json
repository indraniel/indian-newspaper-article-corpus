The court ordered notice to the State government returnable by March 1.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh made the decision following a mention made by R.M.D. Nasrullah, an advocate who is visually impaired. Pointing out media reports, the advocate requested the court to take cognizance of the issue.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, police detained the protesters from three different locations in the city and detained them in Rajarathinam stadium. E. Kuppusamy, who was hard of hearing, was among those detained.\n\nAt 7 p.m. he fell unconscious and he was rushed to the Government Royapettah Hospital where he died on Thursday.",
