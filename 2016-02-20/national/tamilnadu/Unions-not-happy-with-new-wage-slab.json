    "text": "The new minimum wage slabs announced by the State Government this week exclusively for hosiery units are unlikely to pacify trade unions.\n\n\u201cWe are sticking to our stand that a 100 per cent increase be given. The basic wages mentioned in the notification for different jobs like tailoring, cutting, checking, labelling, fabrication, ironing and hand folding in hosiery units are less than that mentioned in the 2014 notification. Since wages are fixed commonly for Tirupur knitwear cluster, covering both domestic hosiery units and export garment units, we will stand by our demands,\u201d said CITU State secretary M. Chandran.\n\nThe wage revision talks were going on in Tirupur knitwear cluster between representatives of six textile associations and eight trade unions after the previous four-year wage pact came to an end on January 30.\n\nSouth India Hosiery Manufacturers Association secretary V. Ponnusami said that the associations would be negotiating the wage revision on the basis of the slabs now been fixed by the State Government.\n\nAccordingly, the minimum wages for workers carrying out tailoring, ironing, packing and cutting fabrics should be Rs. 4,248 a month for 26 working days.\n\nFor those employed in hand folding and checking sections, the minimum monthly basic wages were fixed at a sum of Rs. 1,998 and Rs. 2,448.",
