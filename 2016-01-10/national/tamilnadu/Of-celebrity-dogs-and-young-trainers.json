Praveen, the owner and trainer of Boogie, a four-year-old Beagle from Hyderabad as he made the dog sniff a handkerchief and follow a scent to retrieve another napkin which was placed a few feet away. As Boogie completed the task, the crowd broke into applause.\n\n\u201cBoogie is a champion. He has won in every major dog show that he has participated in and is also an actor as he played the titular role in the Telugu film Tommy last year,\u201d said Mr. Praveen, proudly. Speaking about the ongoing show in Chennai where Boogie had already picked up three prizes for being the best in his breed, Mr. Praveen said they had enjoyed the city and the show so far. There was a host of interesting events on the sidelines of the All Breeds Championship Dog Shows, which included training sessions for animal lovers.\n\nPeople were also busy befriending the dogs that were participating. Tyson, a Rottweiler from Bengaluru, was the cynosure of all eyes as many children gathered around him. While most of them were scared, the trainer there was seen encouraging the children to pet the dog.\n\nNot too far away in the grounds, R. Deepak, a nineteen-year-old trainer, was going over a few training exercises with his Black Labrador Jingle. One of the youngest trainers participating in the event, Mr. Deepak said he had gotten himself certified as a trainer when he was 17, all for his love for dogs.",
