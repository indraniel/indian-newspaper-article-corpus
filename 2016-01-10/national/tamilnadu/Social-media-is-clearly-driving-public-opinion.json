Though the film was sold for far less than what it earned, we still got a lot of mileage out of it. I just heard that the film did better than PK and Lunch Box in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said social media had emerged as a good tool to let people talk. \u201cWith a simple hashtag, it is possible to let the world know about Visaranai . We did that when we screened in Venice. If films such as Visaranai and Kaaka Muttai are spoken about in social media, it helps to a great extent. Social media is driving public opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further said that he would make sure that the uncensored version of Visaranai would be available for Tamil fans.\n\n\u201cThere is no great difference between the two versions. The censored version will have too many beeps. But Dhanush and I are coming up with a strategy. We didn\u2019t know Netflix would arrive in India so soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what would be his definition of a \u2018good film\u2019, filmmaker Ashwin said that films that were made with passion and love for cinema and not just for commercial exploitation were good. Vetrimaran weighed in as well. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any conflict with making a film as a dream and monetising the film. You are conceiving a film to monetise it,\u201d he said.",
