Prabakar, the president of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers\u2019 Association, Subi Thalapathi, said the agricultural community, especially youth, were lured into gambling activities in the club, and had lost enormous money and property.\n\nRepresentations to the Superintendent of Police about anti-social activities in the club have gone unheeded, Mr. Thalapathi said.\n\nThe club with facilities for games and swimming pool was frequented by several customers.

Satheesh assured that the licence of the club will be verified.\n\nBaseless allegations\n\nSuperintendent of Police M.R.
