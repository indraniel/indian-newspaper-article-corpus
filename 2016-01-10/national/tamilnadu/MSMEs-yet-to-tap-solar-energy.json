James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, says the MSMEs need nearly eight kW solar energy and this will involve investment of about Rs. 8 lakh.\n\nScheme\n\nIf the Government announces a scheme for the MSMEs to go in for solar energy, at least those that operate from their own premises can install solar panels.\n\nAccording to S. Ravikumar, president of Coimbatore Tirupur District Tiny and Micro Enterprises Association, a unit that has four lathes will pay a bi-monthly power bill of nearly Rs. 8,000.\n\nThough the electricity bill is high, these units do not have financial resources to go in for solar energy. This is one of the reasons why micro units are unable to develop, he said.\n\nThe Union Government recently earmarked Rs. 5000 crore to promote rooftop solar panel installations at households, government buildings, hospitals and educational institutions. Industry sources say the average investment in a micro unit is between Rs. 2 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh. Hence, the units need financial support to install solar panels.\n\nAccording to an official of Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency here, three or four units have gone in for solar energy of 20 kW to 50 kW each.\n\nThese are medium-scale units and have installed solar panels for captive use.\n\nMSMEs need nearly eight kW solar energy and this will involve investment of about Rs. 8 lakh",
