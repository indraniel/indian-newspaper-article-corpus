    "text": "Encouraged by the recent verdict from Supreme Court, the Tirupur knitwear exporters, who are waging a legal battle against various banks in the alleged derivatives scam, have sought more details from Reserve Bank of India regarding the scam.\n\nThe Supreme Court had ordered the RBI not to withhold any information sought by the exporters regarding the scam. Raja Shanmugam, a Tirupur-based exporter and president of Forex Derivatives Consumer Forum formed of aggrieved exporters who lost Rs 300 crore after buying forex derivatives sold by the banks to hedge currency fluctuations during 2007-08 fiscal, had filed the case.\n\nThough RBI, in one of the affidavits filed before Orissa High Court, stated that \u201ctotal mark to market losses on account of currency derivatives is to the tune of more than Rs. 31,719 crore,\u201d it refused to provide details of bank-wise losses sought by Mr. Shanmugam.\n\nAt the same time, RBI had imposed fines on 19 banks for selling \u2018unsuitable derivative products\u2019 to the exporters.\n\nIn the new petition, the exporters had sought two crucial data apart from the bank-wise losses statement, which would be critical for their legal battle against the banks.\n\n\u201cWe have sought copies of Annual Financial Inspection Reports and concurrent audit reports for the period between April 1, 2007, and March 31, 2015, on the foreign currency derivative contracts sold by the said 19 banks. The other important detail is regarding the responses received from the banks to the RBI\u2019s show cause notice which eventually forced RBI to impose fines on them,\u201d said S. Dhananjayan, technical advisor to the forum.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered the RBI not to withhold any information sought by the exporters",
