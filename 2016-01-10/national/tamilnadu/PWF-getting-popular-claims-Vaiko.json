    "text": "The People\u2019s Welfare Front is becoming popular and gaining widespread acceptance, said MDMK general secretary and PWF coordinator Vaiko here on Saturday.\n\nAddressing the media on the sidelines of his party's conclave of leaders from Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, and Pudukkottai held here, Mr. Vaiko said the aim was to provide a credible alternative to the AIADMK and DMK parties that have ruled the State for several decades now.\n\n\u201cOur front partners have not been enmeshed in corruption or malpractices and that was a huge plus that the people see in us,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Vaiko said that a Damocles\u2019 Sword hung over Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the form of appeal against her acquittal in the disproportionate assets case in the Supreme Court while the DMK was beset with the 2G spectrum allocation case. Both the DMK and the AIADMK must be defeated, he said.\n\nMovement\n\nAlleging that Tamil Nadu was leading the nation in corruption, Mr. Vaiko scathingly said the time had come to launch a movement in the State to remove the corrupt like what Mahatma Gandhi did to oust the British. He said the PWF had dispelled doubts in certain sections during its formation that the front would dissipate soon. With people preferring clean parties and leaders, the stock of the PWF was going up. The front was gaining widespread acceptance from all sections of society as the electorate wanted a corruption-free, liquor-free, and transparent administration, Mr. Vaiko said and added that he believed that the people would ensconce the PWF in power in the Assembly elections.",
