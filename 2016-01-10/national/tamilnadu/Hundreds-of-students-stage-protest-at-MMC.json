The men are believed to be cadre of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK).\n\n\u201cAt 9.45 p.m. on Friday, Sakthivel, a patient, was brought in \u2013 it was a case of assault. He had a scalp laceration. The patient was conscious. We were following the procedure, and registering an accident report. But the men with him began to abuse us asking why we were not treating him, asking us if we were doctors or not. We had already administered first-aid, but we hastened the process and sent him to the emergency ward. There, the process is, to take the history of the case. By that time a mob of about 20 people came in, pushing the two police personnel out of the way. They attempted to manhandle the doctors,\u201d said a house surgeon.\n\nBy 10.45 p.m., all the eight doctors there walked out and demanded an FIR be registered. The police managed to send the four men outside, said a student.\n\n\u201cIt took five hours for the FIR to be registered \u2013 it was finally done at 4 a.m. This is not the first time such an incident has occurred. We are constantly facing harassment and abuse and this has got to stop,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the second such incident in less than a month \u2013 in December, doctors at the Institute of Child Health protested after the family of a child who died, allegedly assaulted a doctor.\n\nOther attacks on doctors in hospitals \u2013 both government and private too, have been reported over the years, and last year, a gangster \u2018Bokkai\u2019 Ravi Kumar was murdered at Government Royapettah Hospital.\n\nFor Friday night\u2019s incident, a case under Section 48 of The Tamil Nadu Medicare Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of violence and damage or Loss to property) Act 2008, has been registered, said a senior police officer attached to the Flower Bazaar police station.\n\nCases under sections 294 B (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code have also been registered, he said.",
