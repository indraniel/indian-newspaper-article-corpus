    "text": "Five-year-old elephant calf Ranga, after a prolonged suffering for over three years, died at the elephant camp at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) early Saturday.\n\nThe elephant calf was first spotted in Sirumugai in 2010 after it was abandoned by the mother, just three days after birth.\n\nAfter efforts to unite the calf with the mother went in vain the authorities took it to Mudumalai and as all this happened during the World Classical Tamil Conference, the then DMK government named the calf \u2018Semmozhian\u2019.\n\nIn 2011, when the AIADMK came to power, Semmozhian was renamed Ranga. It remained playful and naughty at the elephant camp attracting visitors.\n\nThree years ago, Ranga fell at the camp site and suffered fractures in the forelegs and shoulder. The MTR authorities did everything possible to revive the elephant and brought experts like K.C. Panicker from Kerala and others from Tamil Nadu University for Veterinary and Animal Sciences, besides veterinarians N.S. Manoharan and E. Vijayaraghavan.\n\nThe authorities spent more than Rs. 2 lakh for providing a wooden support to put Ranga back on its feet and a water bed to save it from bed sores. The tribal couple M. Manban and M. Badachi were assigned the task of taking care of Ranga.\n\nOn Saturday, a post-mortem was performed and it indicated that organ failure could have been the cause of death. Samples have been lifted and are being sent for examination. Ranga was buried at the elephant camp site.\n\nIt was named \u2018Semmozhian\u2019 by DMK govt and renamed Ranga by AIADMK regime",
