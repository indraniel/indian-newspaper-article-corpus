Eswaran said a decision on the alliance would be taken afresh. This implied that the party was no longer with the NDA, he said. The sub-regional party contested the Lok Sabha election in 2014 as part of the NDA.\n\nThe general council empowered Mr. Eswaran to a take a decision on forming alliance for the forthcoming Assembly elections. A four-member committee had been constituted to advise him.\n\nMr. Eswaran welcomed the Centre\u2019s decision to allow the conduct of Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu. The Centre should allow rooster duel, which was also a traditional sport of the State.\n\nClaiming that peacocks were causing widespread damage to crops, he said the Government should find a solution to the problem too.",
