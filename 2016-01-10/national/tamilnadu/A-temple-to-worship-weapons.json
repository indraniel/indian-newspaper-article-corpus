VIMAL KUMAR\n\nSwords, spears, bows and arrows greet you when you enter this temple at Uppilipalayam, near here.\n\nThe temple is believed to be constructed some 300 years ago.\n\nThe main ritual of the temple is the puja conducted for weapons used during the period, probably to hunt, or to protect villagers.\n\nAbout 75 years ago, an idol of Shiva was placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple alongside the weapons.\n\nThe temple complex, spread over 60 cents, itself is constructed in a way to hold gram sabha, and padashala (school).\n\nIt has facilities to deposit money collected by the village administration, a library, space for teaching youth to use weapons, an Ayurveda centre to treat snake poison, and a place to serve free meals for the poor too.\n\n\u201cThe temple was called 'Vel kottam' in the earlier days before been renamed as 'Paramasivan koil' after the idol was placed,\u201d said S. Ravikumar, an archaeologist who has made many a studies about ancient temples in the region.\n\nThe temple architecture resembles those situated in Kerala.\n\n\u201cThis is because that those who were residing in the village, who originally were from Vellakoil, migrated to Palakkad for a brief period in search of livelihood. After returning, they built the temple to perform puja on weapons to attain prosperity. They might have copied the construction style in Kerala,\u201d said K. Ponnusamy, a historian at the Virarajendran Historical Research Centre.\n\nEven now during festivities, villagers display their skills on using swords and spears.\n\n\u201cSince the temple is not popular outside the region, there is not much crowd,\u201d said S. Ramesh, the temple priest.",
