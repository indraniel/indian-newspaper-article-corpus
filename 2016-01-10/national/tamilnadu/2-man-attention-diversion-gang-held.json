    "text": "The Madipakkam police have arrested a two-member diversion gang, which is said to have been involved in at least three cases \u2013 in Adambakkam, Madipakkam and Pazhavanthangal police station limits.\n\nAccording to the police, the accused N. Babu (39) and V. Devaraj (30), both residents of Rajamangalam, near Villivakkam, were involved in three cases in which they managed to rob three persons of more than Rs. 13.5 lakh on different days and at different places.\n\nThe modus operandi of the duo was to move around shopping complexes and target victims at bank entrances.\n\nOnce the gang noticed any cash, bag or suitcases inside a vehicle, one of the gang members would drop a Rs.10 note in front of it and inform the driver or owner that her money had fallen down.\n\nWhen the owner would get out of the car to check, the other gang member would open the door of the car and take away the bag.\n\nOn October 1, the gang stole a purse containing Rs. 2.5 lakh from a cash assistant of a chit fund operator at Brindavan Nagar, Adambakkam.\n\nThe accused had committed similar thefts at Madipakkam and Nanganallur.\n\nOn their arrest, the police seized Rs. 4 lakh cash apart from 13 sovereigns of gold jewels.",
