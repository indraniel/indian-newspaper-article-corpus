Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran made the observation while dismissing two public interest litigation petitions against proposed consecration of Sri Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram on January 20 on the ground that the ceremony had been fixed in violation of \u2018Karana Agama\u2019 that governed rituals in the temple.\n\nStating that \u2018Agama\u2019 primarily meant tradition, the judges said that the six indigenous religions \u2014 Saivam, Vaishnavam, Saaktham, Kaumaram, Sauram and Gaanaapatyam \u2014 had their own Agamas earlier. But most of those Agamas were lost after their unification by eighth century theologian Adi Sankara.\n\n\u201cWhat survive today are only 28 Saiva Agamas and two principal Vaishnavite Agamas. It appears that Saiva Agamas are classified into four types namely Siddhantha Saivagamas, Paasupatha Saivagamas, Kaapalika Saivagamas and Kaalamukha Saivagamas. All the 28 Saiva Agamas, on the basis of which most of the temples in Tamil Nadu are built, belong to Siddhantha Saivagamas,\u201d they said.\n\nUnder statutory prescriptions, general rule must yield to\n\nspecial rule",
