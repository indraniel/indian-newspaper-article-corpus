For the fine variety, the rate was Rs. 1,520 per quintal along with incentive of Rs. 70. This time, however, there was not much of a difference in the procurement rate by the DPCs and open market. But, it was necessary for the TNCSC to strengthen manpower since farmers in inaccessible locations prefer to sell their produce at the DPCs, Mr. Thalapathy said.\n\nThe procurement was carried out at nine centres: N.G. Palayam, T.N. Palayam, Kookalur, Elur (Arakankottai), Pudukkaraipudur, Puduvalliampalayam, Kasipalayam, Kallipatti and Athani.\n\n\u2018A few farmers found themselves forced to sell their produce in the\n\nopen market\u2019",
