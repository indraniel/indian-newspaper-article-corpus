Gurucharan singing at the concert at Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam's 64th anniversary celebrations in Madurai.\n\nSikkil C.Gurucharan began his concert at Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam's 64{+t}{+h}anniversary celebrations with Papanasam Sivan's sriranjani padavmarna, \"Swami nee manam\" followed by Tyagaraja's Sivakriti, \"Sambho Mahadeva\" in kamavardhini.\n\nThe evening grew very pleasant with his alapana in Mohana with an excellent support from Sanjiv on the violin for Dikshitar's \"Kadambari Priyayaii\" which was well sung.\n\nHe then sang Tyagaraja's \"Makelara\" in Ravichandrika before he launched a delineation of Shanmukapriya for Dikshitar's \"Ekambresa Nayaki\" which he developed to a satisfying finish and received standing ovation.\n\nA pallavi by violinist Sanjivi composed in Vasantha beginning, \"Senthhil Valar\" was followed up with a tanam. The listeners were surprised to note the participation of K.V. Prasad on the mridangam during the tana prasthana. Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira joined him for a satisfying tani.\n\nThe final songs included a tillana and two other Tamil songs: \"Unmai Arindavar\" and \"Unnai Saranadaindhen.\"\n\nThe programme was thus a right mix of tradition and novelty.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
