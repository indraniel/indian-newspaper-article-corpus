    "text": "The bulls would not be subjected to any form of cruelty and the apprehensions of animal lovers would be allayed by the bull tamers and bull owners, said Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan here on Saturday.\n\nHe was accorded a rousing reception by the BJP members and the bull tamers led by TN Jallikattu Peravai members at the airport.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, he said that the sentiments of Tamils had been respected by the Centre. Everyone who had wanted the conduct of jallikattu had expressed satisfaction. This itself showed that people had an affection towards the sport, which has been there from time immemorial.\n\nThe Narendra Modi government had issued an ordinance, thus putting an end to the confusion. He hoped that the beneficiaries would not misuse in any way and be cautious.\n\nTo a query by Animal Welfare Board of India planning to move the apex court on the issue, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that the Centre would face it legally. There need not be any doubts on the conduct of the jallikattu. All Tamils would welcome the \u2018Thai\u2019 Pongal with jallikattu and it will happen with the usual fervour. \u201cIn fact, I am planning to witness the jallikattu along with a few Central ministers at Alanganallur,\u201d he said.",
