    "text": "In an effort to bring thickly populated areas under electronic surveillance, the city police have started reaching out to people for contributions to purchase and install cameras at road junctions.\n\nAs part of one such initiative, 21 high-definition Closed-Circuit TV cameras worth Rs. six lakh were fixed at various locations under the Madipakkam police limits on Saturday.\n\nThe installations were sponsored by residents\u2019 welfare associations and traders associations. Eighteen locations are said to have been chosen by the police based on consensus.\n\nThese cameras were connected through an optic fibre cable laid exclusively for this purpose covering more than 10 kilometres of the networked area.\n\nThe footages from these cameras are said to be monitored round-the-clock by policemen at the Madipakkam police station.\n\nA skit on crime prevention was shown to participants urging them to keep a vigil on their surrounding areas.\n\nThe footages from cameras reach a network video recorder (NVR), a software programme that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, SD memory card or other mass storage device. An NVR contains no dedicated video capture hardware. However, the software is typically run on a dedicated device, usually with an embedded operating system.\n\nLaunching the networked cameras, Deputy Commissioner of Police, St. Thomas Mount, P.S.C. Kalyan said the CCTV cameras would certainly help in crime prevention. With the introduction of community police initiatives, the cameras would certainly help provide information to the beat officers in the area.",
