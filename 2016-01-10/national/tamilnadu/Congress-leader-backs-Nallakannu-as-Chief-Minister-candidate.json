Nallakannu was in the race for the Chief Minister post, he would cast his vote in his favour.\n\nAddressing a meeting organised on behalf of the SC wing of the Congress to confer Ambedkar Award on Mr. Nallakannu, Mr. Elangovan said the Congress had raised its status by presenting the award to the communist veteran.\n\nRecalling senior Congress leader Su. Thirunavukkarasar\u2019s desire for a coming together of the Communist parties and the Congress against the BJP government-led by Narendra Modi, Mr. Elangoavan said electoral requirements would not determine his respect for Mr. Nallakannu. \u201cIt is beside the point whether we join hands or not for the sake of elections. A few years ago when a magazine asked about my favourite leader, I immediately said it was Mr. Nallakannu. He has a special place in my heart,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Elangoavan criticised the AIADMK and the Chief Minister for not doing anything constructively to help flood victims. AICC spokesperson Kushboo spoke.\n\nConfers Ambedkar Award on veteran Communist leader on behalf of SC wing of Congress",
