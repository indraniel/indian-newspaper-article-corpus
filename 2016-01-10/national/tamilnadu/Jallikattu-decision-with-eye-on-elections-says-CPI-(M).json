Ramakrishnan said here on Saturday.\n\nAddressing journalists in the presence of former Member of Parliament P.R. Natarajan and District Secretary V. Ramamoorthy, he said the BJP, AIADMK and DMK trying to claim credit for the lifting of ban ahead of election.\n\nThese parties did very little in 2015 when jallikattu and rekla were not held during Pongal. Now that the government had lifted the ban, it should follow it up with a bill in the ensuing budget session of Parliament.\n\nCM candidate\n\nThe People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) would announce its chief ministerial candidate only after the polls as the constituent parties had come to an understanding on the subject, said Mr. Ramakrishnan.\n\nAt present the alliance was focussed on reaching the voters through its common minimum programme, which offered the people an alternative to the policies and programmes pursued by the AIADMK and DMK.\n\nThe two parties were responsible for the Chennai floods, the deterioration in political culture in the State and scams that had taken place in the last 30 years in the State.\n\n\u2018Government should introduce a bill in the ensuing budget session of Parliament\u2019",
