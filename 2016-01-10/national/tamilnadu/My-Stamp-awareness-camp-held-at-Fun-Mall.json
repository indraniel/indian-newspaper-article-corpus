Fifteen persons (mostly children) took pictures and got stamps with their images on the spot. They paid Rs. 300 to get a set of 12 stamps with the value of Rs. 5 each. The department also created awareness on philately and some of the visitors to the mall opened accounts with the philately club.\n\nRare miniature stamps were also sold during the four-hour event in the evening.\n\nIn a similar camp at Brookefields Mall a couple of weeks ago, 35 persons got \u2018My Stamps\u2019 printed on the spot.\n\nMore camps would be organised in the city to create awareness on \u2018My Stamps\u2019, a postal department official said.",
