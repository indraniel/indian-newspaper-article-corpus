Nevertheless, the water collected in farm ponds has improved the ground water level apart from acting as a drinking water source for cattle,\u201d said P. Alagarsamy, panchayat president.\n\n\u201cWhatever amount of water we used to get by running the bore-well pump for four hours, we are getting the same now in less than two hours,\u201d said V. Balakrishnan from the village.\n\nOf the 61 ponds already dug this year (2015-16) in Sedapatti block, 52 had been dug in Thadayampatti panchayat alone.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to dig considerable number of farm ponds in one panchayat so that their usefulness could be demonstrated clearly,\u201d said B. Rohini Ramdas, Additional Collector and Project Officer of District Rural Development Agency. According to her, the two main objectives of digging farm ponds were to provide a backup source for farmers in emergency situations and also to improve the water table in the area.\n\nDespite being fully funded by the government through MGNREGS, the difficulty, however, was in persuading farmers to set aside a cultivable portion of land for the pond. \u201cParticularly, the small land-holding farmers prefer to utilise their entire land for cultivation. But the success in places like Thadayampatti is helping us to convince them,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Rohini added that with the target of 1290 ponds to be dug in 2015-16, approval had already been provided for 800 ponds of which 300 had been dug.\n\n\u201cSince the farmers are busy with cultivation, the initiative will gain momentum again from next month,\u201d she said.",
