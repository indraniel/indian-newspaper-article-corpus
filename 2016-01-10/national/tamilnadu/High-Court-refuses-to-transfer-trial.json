    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has refused to transfer trial in a corruption case from Kanyakumari to Tirunelveli district at the request of the accusedreportedly suffering from 99 per cent loss of vision besides burst fracture and shoulder dislocation due to an accidental fall.\n\nJustice M. Venugopal dismissed the transfer petition filed by Jothindra Geeth Prakash who had been facing a trap case booked against by Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) sleuths in Kanyakumari in 2008 and is now pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in the district.\n\nThe petitioner based in Tirunelveli district had expressed severe inconvenience in travelling to Kanyakumari since he was suffering from loss of vision in both his eyes to nearly 99 per cent.\n\nHe also claimed to have been fixed titanium pedicle screws and rods in the vertebra after the burst fracture.\n\nOn the other hand, Government Advocate P. Kandasamy opposed the plea for the transfer on the ground that the trial in the case was half way through and hence transferring the case at this stage would cause financial loss to the government if it was forced to take the witnesses from Kanyakumari to Tirunvelveli.\n\nAfter recording the objections, the judge said that the petitioner could file appropriate applications under Section 317 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and seek exemption from appearance if he faced difficulties in appearing before the trial court on specific dates.",
