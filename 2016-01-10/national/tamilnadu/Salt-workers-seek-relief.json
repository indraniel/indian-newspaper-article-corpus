This workforce had lost its houses as well as livelihood in the wake of heavy rains in November and December.\n\nConsidering their plight and economic condition, the government should extend assistance for salt workers, M. Krishnamurthy, district coordinator, Unorganised Workers\u2019 Federation, told The Hindu here on Saturday.\n\nAround 200 houses of the workers had been fully damaged and over 500 houses suffered partial damage in the rains. Around 50,000 workers had been relying on 22,000 acres of salt pans in the district. While the salt industry took a beating, the authorities did not consider the plight of workers, most of whom are below poverty line.\n\nHe was worried that the central team, which toured Tuticorin on January 6 to assess damages caused by rains and floods, did not take stock of the condition of these workers.\n\nThough several benefits in the form of housing under Namak Mazdoor Awas Yojana and social security, insurance and health care facilities were available for salt workers, they were not implemented anywhere here.\n\nTo enhance their socio economic conditions and protect their rights, the Central government should form salt workers\u2019 cooperative societies here.\n\nFurther, he said, Tamil Nadu accounted for 12.5 per cent production of salt in the country and Tuticorin contributed to nearly 80 per cent of the production.\n\nAround 200 houses of the workers were fully damaged and over 500 houses suffered partial damage in the rains",
