    "text": "The Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector is in a suffocated state post the recent floods and the units impacted are worried that with elections nearing the government would neglect them. Employees of the MSME sector will be protesting on January 11 to bring their problems to the State government\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cSeveral Ministers have visited us and we have been repeating the same story but we have not got a solution. We will be protesting on January 11 and take this to government\u2019s notice,\u201d said S. Jayaprakashan, Secretary, Consortium of Tamil Nadu Micro Industries Association, at an interactive session on Rain or Shine - Make in Tamil Nadu, organised by the Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) jointly with all industry associations.\n\nOfficials from the MSME sector were concerned about the upcoming elections. They requested State Industries Secretary C. V. Sankar, who was also present at the event, that papers relating to floods should be processed even during elections.\n\n\u201cOfficers who are handling flood-related issues should not be deployed for election work. Many of our customers are waiting to cancel orders. They don\u2019t want any further delay from our end,\u201d said M. Rafeeque Ahmed, Chairman of the Council for Leather Exports.\n\nSome of the members were also irked that the Industries Minister P Thangamani did not turn up at the event.\n\nThe whole idea of this meet was to discuss immediate need of financial assistance the banks apart from discussing the importance of settlement of claims by the insurance sector. \u201cWe have been explaining our problems both to the Centre and State. This is the fifth meeting. Today, the Minister has not come and we are just talking amongst ourselves. We are not getting any solution,\u201d lamented one of the speakers.\n\n\u201cThe relief has to be immediate, not after two months,\u201d said C. K. Mohan, Vice President, Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association. He added, \u201cMany units have suffered production loss and are not able to pay the workers. If this continues we would have to lose manpower.\u201d\n\nPalani G. Periasamy, President, SICCI, said, \u201cDuring the Thane Cyclone the government had given financial grants to all MSME units. A similar approach is required now.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the Thirumudivakkam industrial estate lamented that it\u2019s been over a month now since BSNL lines were affected. The government should focus on strengthening basic infrastructure at all industrial parks they said.\n\nMr. Sankar countered all the queries and said, \u201cI will convey these concerns to the government. We will take long term measures that will avoid such situations in future,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Tamil Nadu has a strong MSME base with investments of Rs. 67,130 crore providing employment to more then 69 lakh persons who produce over 6,000 different products.\n\nIndustries Minister fails to turn up at interactive meeting to highlight problems",
