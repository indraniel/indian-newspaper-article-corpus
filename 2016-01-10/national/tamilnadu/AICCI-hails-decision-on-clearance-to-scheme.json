    "text": "All India Chamber of Commerce and Industries (AICCI), Tuticorin, has hailed the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving clearance to \u2018Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme.\u2019 This move would certainly help apparel, garment and technical textiles industries get 15 per cent subsidy and the remaining sub sectors would get 10 per cent subsidy on their capital investment, P.S.S.K. Raja Sankaralingam, president, AICCI, told The Hindu here on Saturday. This amended scheme would trigger growth and boost exports for the textile industry.\n\nMore importantly, this would help the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative flourish in the longer term. It would also give a boost to employment generation in the textile sector. AVMV. Mani, former president of AICCI, said there were certain cases of delay in providing subsidies for projects, already completed for technical upgradation. But they had been kept pending due to some procedural aspects. Hence, such projects should be cleared for availing subsidies and thereby it would be a boost to industrialists, he said.",
