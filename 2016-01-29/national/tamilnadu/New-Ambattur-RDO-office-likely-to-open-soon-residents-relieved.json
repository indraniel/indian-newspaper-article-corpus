    "text": "The new RDO office has remained closed for over a year due to a court case \u2014Photo: M.Vedhan\n\nResidents of Padi and Mogappair have something to cheer about. The Revenue Divisional Office, Ambattur, which has remained closed for over a year, is likely to be inaugurated soon.\n\nAt present, residents have to travel at least seven km to the Ambattur taluk office to make any enquiries about government welfare schemes or getting certificates.\n\nThe RDO office is now functioning in a small room at the Taluk office.\n\nResidents have to either take an autorickshaw or walk a few kilometres as there is no bus stop near the taluk office.\n\nThough the new Ambattur RDO facility was constructed on Thirumangalam Road in 2014, it remained closed due to a court case. The facility was even used as a warehouse to stock materials like mixies and grinders to be distributed to people.\n\nHowever, with the issue solved now, the Public Works Department, which executed the Rs.1.26 crore project, recently submitted a letter to the Tiruvallur collectorate and Revenue Department about inauguration of the building.\n\nSpread over 6,000 sq.ft., the new RDO office will also accommodate the village administrative office, Collector Nagar.\n\nWelcoming the move, residents wanted the new facility on the arterial road to be opened soon as they otherwise have to visit the crowded tahsildar office.",
