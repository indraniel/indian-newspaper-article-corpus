It will also include several new elements such as the launch of a multimedia mapping project of Puducherry.\n\nThe events include panel discussions, guided tours, art and cultural programmes, exhibitions, and nature walks. The inauguration and line-up of events will see the participation of India Director of UNESCO Shigeru Aoyagi; dancer Anita Ratnam, recipient of the Union government\u2019s 100 top women achievers of India award; Puducherry-based dancer Krithiga Ravichandran; conservation architects K.T.

Attendance for some events requires prior registration which can be done online.\n\nFocus on children\n\nThe Pondicherry Heritage Festival 2016 will have a special focus on children with the aim of inculcating in them a love for all things heritage \u2014 whether it means discovering traditional games or indulging in some story telling.\n\nA large chunk of these activities for children will take place throughout the three days of the festival at the Craft Bazaar at Gandhi Thidal.\n\nThe multimedia mapping project (using an Open Source map) will have children capturing things of interest to them such as arts, music, crafts, cuisines, architectural features and games on the map. Each indicator for a marked spot can include photographs, audio and video files, stories and even drawings, says Virginia Soukup, who is handling the project. It will later be opened to adults as well. The organisers hope to have a web-based version and an Android-based application for users.\n\nThe inauguration on February at 6.30 p.m. at Gandhi Thidal will include the recitation of a special poem on Puducherry, and a Bharatanatyam performance by Ms. Ravichandran. It will be attended by Chief Minister N.
