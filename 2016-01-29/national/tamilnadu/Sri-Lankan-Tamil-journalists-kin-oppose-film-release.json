Ganesan, challenging the order of Film Certification Appellate Tribunal refusing certification to the movie.\n\nIn his original petition, the director submitted that he directed the film based on the telecast made by London-based TV Network Channel \u2013 4, on the final war between the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE. \u201cI came to know about the Tamil News Reader Isaipriya through the telecast and I thought I could direct a Tamil film based on her real life,\u201d Mr. Ganesan said.\n\nOn May 6, 2015 he applied for a certification for his film with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Chennai, which was rejected on the grounds that the film is against friendly relation with a foreign State for depicting women in a degrading manner.",
