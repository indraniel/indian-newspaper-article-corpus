The police used mild force and chased them away.\n\nAfter a melee, a section of the protestors managed to reach the taluk office and squatted inside the office complex, when the police arrested them. They were detained in a marriage hall and released in the evening, the police said.\n\nVillage leader Azhagappan said that the chemical plant had spoiled two main waterbodies in the village catering to their agricultural needs by letting out hazardous effluents, and forced the villagers to abandon agriculture in about 800 acres.\n\nThe plant was producing sodium hydrosulphite (SHS) and leakage of sulphur dioxide from the plant caused problems to the local people, Venugopal, a CPI (M) functionary who led the protest along with Chellathurai, said.\n\nSivaganga MLA Gunasekaran, who expressed solidarity with the agitating villagers, said that the company posed a grave threat to the people living in surrounding areas and demanded its closure.",
