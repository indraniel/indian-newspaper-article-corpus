All stakeholders, including members of Department of Commerce and Revenue department, were present at the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe ball is now in Tamil Nadu\u2019s court. States like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are offering competitive deals, so Tamil Nadu needs to go the extra mile and come out with a more competitive package,\u201d said a senior official from the Fast Track Task Force.\n\n\u201cThere are firms which are willing to come and manufacture at the facility. But it all depends on what package is being offered to them,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated that the government was making every effort to revive the plant. At that time, Ministers and officials from the Tamil Nadu government gave an assurance that they would not abandon the plant.\n\nNokia got the green signal to set up a Special Economic Zone in 2005 and was allocated 210.8 acres. The plant was set up in 2006 and was one of the largest facilities for the firm.",
