Top six teams were eventually selected for the quiz contest based on the scores they had secured in the written test.\n\nIt virtually turned out to be an all Tiruchi show as five of the top teams that made it to the finals were from the city barring one from Karur.\n\nTwo teams from Sri Akilandeswari Vidyalaya, Tiruchi and one each from Sri Vageesha Vidyashram, Kamala Niketan Montessori School, Mount Litera Zee School and Chettinad Vidya Mandir, Karur made it to the finals.\n\nThe slew of questions picked out from different topics including Photo Play and Sight and Sound made it lively with the audience on their feet to reply to those that could not be answered by the participants.\n\nThe right answers from the audience earned them goodies offered by sponsors.\n\nFrom the word go, the team representing Mount Litera Zee School established a clear lead over their rivals which was maintained till the end to emerge victorious yet again scoring 151 points.\n\nThe team comprising Anirudh Renganathan and M.V.
