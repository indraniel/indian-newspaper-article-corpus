    "text": "Attempts made by an accused in a criminal case to try his luck by filing bail applications simultaneously in two courts could not be cited as a reason for one court to cancel the bail granted by it on merits without knowing about the application pending in another court, the Madras High Court Bench here has held.\n\nJustice M. Venugopal gave the ruling while reversing an order passed by the Principal and Sessions Court in Tiruchi on November 3 cancelling the bail granted by it on September 7 to one M. Shabeer, accused of having stolen Rs. 7.2 lakh from the shop of Mannar Mohammed alias Jahangeer who had lodged a complaint with Fort Police Station.\n\n\u201cIt is to be borne in mind that a court of law is to exercise its power as regards the cancellation of bail with utmost care and caution. A court of law is to balance the right to personal liberty versus the society\u2019s interest\u2026 Cancellation of bail should not be ordered by way of punishment even if a prima facie case against an accused is proved,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the present case, the Sessions Court had cancelled the bail granted by it after the complainant brought to its notice that on the date of grant of bail the accused had filed a similar application before a Judicial Magistrate Court too. However, the application pending before the Magistrate was withdrawn after obtaining favourable orders from the Sessions Court.\n\nAssailing the decision taken by the court to cancel the bail, C. Jegannathan, counsel for the accused, contended that bail, once granted, could be cancelled only for reasons such as the accused having committed a heinous offence or if there was possibility of him absconding or if he had indulged in threatening the witnesses and not for any other reason.",
