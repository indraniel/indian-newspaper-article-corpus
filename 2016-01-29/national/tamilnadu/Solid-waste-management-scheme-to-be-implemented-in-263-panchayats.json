Rajaraman on Tuesday.\n\nAddressing a gram sabha meeting at Nallamanayakkanpatti village, the Collector said that the beneficiary panchayats would be chosen on the basis of their population (over 300 houses and Dalits comprising over 50 per cent of the total population) and presence of government hospitals or primary health centres. Vehicles to transport the garbage and tools for collection would be provided for those involved in garbage clearance. A segregation yard would be constructed at a cost of Rs. two lakh in all selected panchayats, Mr. Rajaraman said. Under the efforts to make panchayats open defecation-free, 125 individual toilets and two sanitary complexes for men and women had been constructed at Nallamanayakkanpatti, which had already qualified as open defecation-free panchayat, the Collector said.\n\nAccording to an official press release, Mr. Rajaraman appealed to the people to keep their surroundings clean to prevent mosquito breeding. Overhead tanks supplying drinking water to villages should be cleaned once in 15 days and people should approach the nearest government hospital for treatment of viral fever. They should prevent water stagnation around their homes, he said. He also advised them not to use plastic products that were hazardous to the environment.\n\nTreatment to the tune of Rs. 20.29 crore had been provided under the Chief Minister\u2019s comprehensive health insurance scheme for 10, 769 beneficiaries in the district, the gram sabha was told.\n\n\u201cA segregation yard will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 2 lakh in all selected panchayats\u201d",
