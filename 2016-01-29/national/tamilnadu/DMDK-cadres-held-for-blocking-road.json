    "text": "As many as 61 cadres of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), including six women, were arrested for blocking road near Anna bus stand here on Thursday.\n\nThe DMDK functionaries, who had obtained permission for staging a demonstration, started blocking the road at the entry point of the bus stand, throwing traffic out of gear in the area for a brief period. The party members urged the municipal authorities to relay the roads which were dug up for underground drainage work.\n\nThey said that the UGD work was going at a snail\u2019s pace, disturbing free movement of vehicles and pedestrians, especially during the rainy season.\n\nAddressing the agitators, Jagannathan, Kanyakumari East district secretary, said that the roads in Nagercoil were in a bad shape and not motorable. He also said that the UGD work had been going on for the last three years.\n\nAs many agitations staged by the DMDK failed to bring about any result, the cadres were forced to block the road. If the authorities did not relay roads, the party functionaries would go on an indefinite hunger strike, he added.\n\nNagercoil Town Deputy Superintendent of Police T. Eswaran rushed to the spot and asked the agitators to disperse. As they refused to budge, 61 cadres were arrested. The arrested were released in the evening.",
