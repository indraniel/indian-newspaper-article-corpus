    "text": "MITRA is an Android GSM/CDMA-based mobile app aimed at safety of women, children and the elderly which, once downloaded on a smartphone, allows users to send SOS alerts to three pre-stored emergency contacts among family or friends.\n\nAll the user has to do is to long press the audio button to launch the app and send out an SMS to the three numbers.\n\nThe system\u2019s advantages include the fact that in an emergency you need not open the app (all you need is to long press a button), or try to make a call. It also requires no Internet connection and has been customised for the Puducherry region.\n\nThe app auto composes a message with details of the sender\u2019s geographical location (latitude and longitude), the nearest police station and its landline, the IMEI number and an alert that the user is in trouble. The police station helps the recipient of the SOS to contact the station immediately while the IMEI helps police trace the person in distress.",
