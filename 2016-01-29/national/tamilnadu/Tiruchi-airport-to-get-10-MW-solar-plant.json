    "text": "The airport here has decided to harness green energy for its power requirements as part of its effort to conserve power and protect environment.\n\nThe Airports Authority of India (AAI) management has given its approval for a proposal to establish a 10 mega watt capacity solar power plant at the airport. So, the airport authorities have entrusted the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited the task of preparing a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the power project.\n\nA team of BHEL officials from Bangalore and New Delhi inspected the airport in the first week of this month and surveyed the spot. The plan is to put in place a ground mounted solar power plant at a cost ranging between Rs. 60 crore and Rs. 70 crore at the airport.\n\nBHEL would shortly submit the DPR containing a host of aspects to the airport authorities, sources told The Hindu . The plan is to complete the project by the end of the 2016-17 financial year. The plant would come up in the operational area of the airport.\n\nThe solar power would be a back-up for the requirements of the airport.",
