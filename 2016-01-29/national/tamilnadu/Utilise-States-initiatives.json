James\n\nLaunching the three-day public information campaign organised by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) here on Thursday, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao urged the youngsters to make use of the Central government initiatives such as \u2018Digital India\u2019 and \u2018Skill India\u2019 as opportunities were abound now.\n\nPointing out how technologies had shrunk the world, Mr. Rao said that any information or opportunity available in any corner of the world could be known through Internet. \u201cDigital India is about making technologies like Internet easily available to everyone and bringing governance closer to people. The State government has also given laptops to students. Use such initiatives constructively,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Rao visited the stalls set up as part of the campaign at the Madurai Medical College by State and Central government departments explaining various initiatives.\n\nThe three-day event will mainly focus on Mission Indradhanush, Digital India, Skill India and initiatives for women empowerment and entrepreneurship.\n\nSpecial focus was given on the first day of the campaign to Mission Indradhanush, launched in December 2014 by the Union government to improve full immunisation coverage of children below two years of age.\n\nThe authorities explained that of the 201 high focus districts chosen from 28 States, eight were from Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Tiruchi, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Vellore and Virudhunagar).",
