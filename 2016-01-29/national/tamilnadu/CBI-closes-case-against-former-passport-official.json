    "text": ": Years after a corruption case was registered against former Regional Passport Officer Sumathi Ravichandran, the CBI has closed the disproportionate assets case against her due to lack of evidence. However, chargesheet was filed against the official in another case and trial is on, sources said on Thursday.\n\nMs. Ravichandran, her husband and Health Officer in the Chennai Corporation Ravichandran, and two travel agents were arrested by the CBI\u2019s Anti-Corruption Branch on April 26, 2009. It was alleged that the official took bribe through a travel agent to expedite issuance of passports under the tatkal scheme.\n\nA case was registered based on a complaint lodged by a passport applicant Lakshmanan of MGR Nagar in Chennai that he paid Rs. 9,000 as bribe to the RPO through Fathima Muzaffar Ahmed, a travel agent of Ahmed World Travels, T.Nagar. CBI officials laid a trap and arrested the official, her husband and the travel agents. The cash allegedly taken as bribe from the complainant was recovered from the agent. Besides this, a disproportionate wealth case was registered against the RPO. \u201cWe have not found adequate material to prosecute the official in the disproportionate assets case. Since there is a lot of ancestral property and her husband is also employed, it became difficult to precisesly quantify the assets amassed by her in her capacity as the RPO. There was a deviation of about 10 per cent in the returns filed and actually property assessed which does not warrant prosecution,\u201d a senior investigator said.",
