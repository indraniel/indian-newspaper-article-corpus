The festival will focus on each sub-region. Instead of hosting a one-day workshop on water and forgetting about it the next day, the festival will focus on how to connect community, experts and the government for a sustained effort on water conservation. There will be a consultation on long term strategy and commitment,\u201d said Probir Banerjee of NGO PondyCAN, one of the organisations involved in the collective.\n\nThe activities under the festival will be organised in Bahour (February 3-8), Cuddalore (February 9-15), Puducherry (February 16-22), Auroville (February 23-29), Villianur (March 1-7), Vanur (March 8-14) and Marakkanam (March 15-21).\n\nEvents include films, puppet shows, theatre, competitions and cleaning up of tanks, ponds and irrigation channels by volunteers.\n\nThe festival will observe World Wetland Day (February 2), World Water Day (March 22), World Day of Social Justice (February 20), National Science Day (February 28), World Wildlife Day (March 3) and International Day of Forests (March 21).\n\nSchools and teachers will be roped in and sensitised on water management, said P. Joseph Victor Raj from Holistic approach for People\u2019s Empowerment (HOPE), another organisation involved in the collective.\n\nWater specialist Tom Gerard Gablier from Auroville said that the festival would be a platform for sharing of expertise by those working in the field for long, and would also involve handing over the upkeep of water resources to the next generation. It would pass on the message that \u2018water must be respected,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe festival will be attended by environmental activist Rajendra Singh, who won the prestigious Stockholm Water Prize in 2015, and Anupam Mishra who was awarded the 1996 Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puraskar.\n\nDetails about the festival can be found athttp://allforwaterforall.org\n\nIt will look at water management in Puducherry, Auroville, Villupuram, Cuddalore bio-region",
