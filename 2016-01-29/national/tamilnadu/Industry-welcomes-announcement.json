The associations have come forward to support the project with suggestions and even in implementation of the project.\n\nRajesh Lund, president of CREDAI \u2013 Coimbatore, said being selected for the Smart City project should do a lot of good for the city in terms of better infrastructure. The Indian Green Building Council can give its inputs to make the city greener and support people who take up green initiatives.\n\nThere could be tax incentives or relaxation on FSI. There should be citizen participation in all the projects. The services and quality of life should improve for the public.\n\nAccording to Manimaran, chairperson of Institute of Indian Interior Designers, a city can be smarter even without IT-based systems. There should be a landmark for the city \u2013 be it an area, building or a structure. Have transparent systems and ensure that the construction activity is affordable, is our aim.",
