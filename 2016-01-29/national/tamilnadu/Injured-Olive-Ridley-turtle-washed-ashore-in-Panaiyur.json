    "text": "An injured olive ridley turtle, with its flippers chopped, was found stranded on the shore in Panaiyur on Thursday morning.\n\nVolunteers of the TREE Foundation, who went to the spot, found that the turtle had its flippers on the left side chopped and cut marks on its snout and carapace, which could have resulted from being entangled in a net. While a few of the injuries had healed since they had possibly been caused a few months ago, the turtle was found to be weak and dehydrated.\n\nSupraja Dharini of Tree Foundation said the turtle was taken to the rehabilitation centre of the foundation and administered treatment.\n\nWith the Olive Ridley nesting season falling between January and March, many volunteers and conservationists have started patrolling beaches in the city to spot nests and take eggs to the safety of hatcheries.\n\nMany volunteers retrieving nests said there was an increase in the number of dead turtles being washed ashore.\n\n\u201cWe have recorded 45 dead turtles and one injured turtle so far this year. Most of the turtles we found washed ashore dead have injuries and signs that they have drowned in fishing gear such as trawl and gill nets,\u201d Ms. Dharini said. In 2013, there were 202 turtles stranded alive or dead ashore and it rose to 423 turtles in 2014. In 2015, there were 411 turtles stranded, data available with the foundation indicates.",
