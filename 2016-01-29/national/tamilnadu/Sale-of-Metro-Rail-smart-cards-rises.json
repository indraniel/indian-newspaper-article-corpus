Though tokens are still sold out largely, six months after the first service, smart cards are now being preferred as there are people who travel more frequently than before.\n\n\u201cAfter the floods, the average passenger traffic has grown from about 8,000-9,000 a day to 12,000 a day. Nowadays, we find that smart cards are beginning to sell well than earlier. For instance, 500-600 cards per station are being sold now, about 100 more than a few months ago,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe Chennai Metro Rail, built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, launched its first service between Koyambedu and Alandur \u2014 a distance of 10 km only in July 2015 after five years of work.\n\nThe fare for this stretch ranges between Rs. 10 and Rs. 40 for ordinary class, and between Rs. 20 and Rs. 80 for special class.\n\n\u2018Common ticketing system\u2019\n\nMonths after the launch, to give a boost to patronage, they started issuing special trip cards to commuters. Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) officials said smart cards were important to encourage patronage in the city.\n\nThey added that they had incorporated 12 features in the card for the convenience of commuters, including its use on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses and even in shopping malls, but this is yet to be put to use.",
