    "text": "The Madras High Court has refused to stay the operation of a notice issued by the School Education Department directing actor Rajinikanth, his wife Latha Rajinikanth and Vandana Tugnait, the principal of a school run by the actor\u2019s Sri Ragavendra Trust to appear before the authorities to explain the dispute over the lease of the land where the school is located.\n\nWhen the petition moved by the principal came up for hearing before Justice M.M. Sundresh, the judge said: \u201cThe school could have put forth its case before the official instead of coming to the court.\u201d\n\nNew rules\n\nAccording to the petitioner, in 2011, the owner of the land where the school is located filed a civil suit for its eviction. When the matter was pending before the court, the School Education Department introduced new rules for matriculation schools mandating submission of lease deed at least for 30 years for the purpose of renewal of permission.\n\nFavourable order\n\nApparently, the school could not submit the lease deed, and the land owner also obtained a favourable order in the civil suit.\n\nIt is in this circumstance the Joint Director of School Education directed Mr. Rajinikanth and the other two to appear for an enquiry.\n\nChallenging the notice and seeking exemption from personal appearance, the school principal filed the present writ petition.\n\nDispute over lease of the land where a school is located",
