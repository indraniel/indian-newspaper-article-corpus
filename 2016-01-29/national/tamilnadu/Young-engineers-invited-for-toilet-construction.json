    "text": "Swachh Bharat ambassadors have planned to rope in young civil engineers for toilet construction. R. Raveendran, an ambassador, said that they had decided to encourage young engineers, who by forming start-ups could take up toilet construction. They were ready to support the start-ups for construction of 30 toilets.\n\nIf the model proved successful, they would help the start-ups more for the 2,000-odd toilets planned for construction in the first phase in Coimbatore Corporation limits in 2015-16.\n\nThe ambassadors were working with the Corporation and also corporate companies that could contribute their corporate social responsibility funds for the programme. The Central and State governments and the Corporation gave Rs. 8,000 to the beneficiaries and the latter would have to pay Rs. 4,000.\n\nOr, they could take the support of the corporate companies to construct toilets at Rs. 20,000 \u2013 the money fixed at the last Swachh Bharat meeting.\n\nMr. Raveendran said that interested engineers could reach him on 98422-33446 for further details.",
