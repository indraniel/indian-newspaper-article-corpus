Though the surgery, costing about Rs. 7.5 lakh, had been covered under amil Nadu government\u2019s Chief Minister\u2019s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS), only five hospitals in the State \u2014 government hospitals in Chennai, Coimbatore and Nagercoil and two private hospitals in Chennai \u2014 had been empanelled to perform the surgery under the scheme.\n\nChildren from Madurai and surrounding regions had to go to Chennai for the surgery earlier. Many of the children had to be taken to Chennai even after the surgery as the procedure involved post-operative audio-verbal therapy sessions for a year. \u201cNow, we are collaborating with the Hearing Aid Centre in Madurai so that the children can continue their therapy sessions here itself,\u201d said N. Dhinakaran, Head of the ENT department at the GRH.\n\nBoth the beneficiaries \u2014 S. Ajay from Madurai and J. Rudrapriya from Sattur in Virudhunagar district \u2013 hailed from poor families. Speaking to The Hindu , their family members said that though they identified their children to be aurally challenged when they were about two years old, they could not get the implants done as they had to go to Chennai.\n\n\u201cThough all medical expenses will be covered under the insurance scheme, we cannot afford accommodation in Chennai for long,\u201d said S. Aarti, Ajay\u2019s mother.\n\nL. Arul Sundareshkumar from the ENT department said that cochlear implants could not be done for everyone with profound deafness. \u201cThey have to be screened for other medical conditions, including autism, that can render the cochlear implants ineffectual,\u201d he said.",
