If the repayment was prompt and the loan amount was repaid by the 25th week, the borrower would be given fresh loan with 4 per cent interest rate.\n\n\u201cThe cooperative banks should organise special camps across the district to identify the right borrowers and give them micro credit. Heads of the banks should select the right borrowers during the 10-day special camps,\u201d Mr. Peter said.\n\nHe said that Tirunelveli District Central Cooperative Bank, Tirunelveli Junction City Cooperative Bank and the Cooperative Banks at Palayamkottai, Tirunelveli Town, Veeravanallur, Kallidaikurichi and Ambasamudram should organise such camps. In a function held at Palayamkottai Cooperative Bank, Rajya Sabha MP S. Muthukaruppan gave away micro credit to the small traders on Thursday.",
