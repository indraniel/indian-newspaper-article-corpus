Karthikeyan\n\nResidents of Theni and Periyakulam Municipalities will get protected drinking water on daily basis from March end, as the TWAD Board has almost completed its two major drinking water projects. Trial run will be conducted for Periyakulam project by February 15.\n\nAt present, Periyakulam municipality has been supplying 4.5 million litres of water to 44,950 residents. The supply can be enhanced after augmentation.\n\nThe speciality of the project is that electricity will not be required to pump water from head works to treatment plant as water will be drawn through natural gravity.\n\nTo scale down pressure in pipeline, break pressure tank (60,000 litre capacity) was constructed at the treatment plant. After the purification process, protected water will be stored in a 6-lakh-litre capacity ground level sump and two over head tanks at Vadakarai and Thenikarai for distribution to residential areas. New pipeline was laid to cover a distance of 38 km so far and the rest seven km will be covered shortly. After completion of the laying work, existing pipelines and new pipelines will be interconnected with OHTs for regular supply.\n\nTo augment water supply to Theni municipality, the TWAD board has been executing comprehensive drinking water project with Vaigai dam as its source at an estimated cost of Rs.68.83 crore. On completion, the TWAD board will supply 2.8 million litres of water to Theni municipality. Besides existing nine over head tanks, four new OHTs are being constructed at Balan Nagar, KRR Nagar, Karuvelnaickenpati and Kakkan Nagar.\n\n\u201cThe laying of pipelines for a distance of 82 km is in progress. We can meet the drinking water needs of up to 1.5 lakh people as against the existing population of 94,423 persons,\u201d said TWAD Board Superintending Engineer Marimuthu.\n\nWhile inspecting the project here on Thursday, Collector N. Venkatachalam said residents of both municipalities would get 135 litres of water a day against the present supply of 90 litres. Water supply would be made on daily basis. Officials were advised to execute the project within the stipulated time.\n\nIn the pipeline\n\nNew projects were also in the pipeline to provide water to other areas, he added.\n\nIn future, the TWAD board has plans to implement three more projects meant for Usilampati, Andipatti and Vadugapatti with Vaigai dam as its prime source.",
