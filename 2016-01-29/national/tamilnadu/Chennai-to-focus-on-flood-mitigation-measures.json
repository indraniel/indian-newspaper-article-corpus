In addition to the Rs. 1,000 crore to be released over a period of five years by the Central and State governments, multilateral agencies will fund smart cities mission projects,\u201d said an official of Chennai Corporation.\n\nSome of the projects such as a pedestrian plaza in T. Nagar have been included in the proposal sent by the Corporation. \u201cOne of the two parts of the proposal includes implementation of a non-motorised transport policy with solid waste management, better street lighting with LED lights, smart traffic and parking management systems,\u201d said Aswathy Dilip, Manager-Communications, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, which assisted Chennai Corporation in finalising the proposal .\n\n\u201cChennai\u2019s streets have seen very high road fatalities with four people dying every day in road accidents, and there is a decline in walking and cycling as modes of transport, indicating a strong need to focus on better streets. This is the reason why promoting non-motorised transport was selected as the main pan-city initiative,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the area-based proposal, T.Nagar was selected following various stake-holder consultations.",
