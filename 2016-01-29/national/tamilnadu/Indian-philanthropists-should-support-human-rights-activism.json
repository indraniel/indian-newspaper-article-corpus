Ashok\n\nHenri Tiphagne, the first Indian chosen by Amnesty International for its Human Rights Award, feels that time has come for Indian philanthropists to support hardcore human rights activism.\n\nAmnesty International announced on January 25 that the 8{+t}{+h}Human Rights Award would be conferred on Mr. Tiphagne, executive director of Madurai-based People\u2019s Watch, on April 25 at Maxim Gorki Theatre, Berlin, in recognition of his \u201cexceptional commitment to human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cHenri Tiphagne and his organisation People\u2019s Watch, while fighting to ensure the rights of others, are themselves being harassed and hampered in their work by the authorities. And there are other civil society organisations in India that are in a similar position. The award is therefore meant to send a strong signal of support to the whole of the Indian human rights movement,\u201d said Selmin Caliskan, Director of Amnesty International Germany, in a statement.\n\nRecounting his tryst with human rights activism, Mr. Henri says that he entered the arena when \u2018human rights\u2019 was treated as a \u201cbad word.\u201d There were at least two occasions when he wanted to resume his profession as a lawyer when the government closed the funding channels.\n\n\u201cBut I realised that defending human rights outside courts was my calling. When all these attacks on human rights defenders are taking place, I feel comforted that I have made the right option, though a painful option,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe Amnesty International Award is not for an individual but for all Indian human rights defenders, who are functioning under terrible restrictions even on protest and dissent. It is also for my mentors like K. Balagopal and K.G. Kannabiran who lived when award culture was not there for the type of work they did,\u201d says Mr. Tiphagne.\n\n\u201cIn the modern context, foreign investment for industries is welcome but any funding to protect the rights of people is looked at with suspicion,\u201d he notes.\n\nThe award, presented once in two years, is endowed with 10,000 Euros. The recipients of the award include Monira Rahman of Bangladesh (2006), Women of Zimbabwe Arise (2008), Abel Barrera of Mexico (2011) and Alice Nkom of Cameroon (2014).",
