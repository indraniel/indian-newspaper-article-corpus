And, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp were abuzz with messages on Coimbatore figuring in the list.\n\n\u201cSmart City has happened. Now, lets start somewhere,\u201d says Ravi Sam, former chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry \u2013 Tamil Nadu.\n\nCoimbatore has an educated population. There should be door-to-door campaign and address the main issues, he says.\n\nAccording to an analysis of the city submitted by the local body to the Centre for the project, the strengths include a vibrant growing economy, good social infrastructure, and active citizen forums. But, there are gaps in basic service levels, sanitation and water-water infrastructure, growing traffic congestion and accident rates and underdeveloped green areas and open spaces.\n\nThere are opportunities to improve finances and leverage potential and transform intrinsic natural habitats into rejuvenated public spaces.\n\nThe immediate focus is expected to be on forming the special purpose vehicle.\n\nCoimbatore Corporation plans to have area-based development, have more open spaces and green areas. The entire project would also foster a vibrant economy and have citizen-focused governance.\n\nAs the project should be sustainable, it has also come out with a component-wise plan to cover the operation and maintenance costs.\n\nWith non-motorised transport system, more solar power systems, sewage treatment plants in all the water bodies, the main civic problems of the city will be addressed, said officials.",
