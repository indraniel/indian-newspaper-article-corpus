    "text": "Though by virtue of the Tamil Nadu Official Languages Act 1956, Tamil is the official language of subordinate courts, just because a trial court judge has written the judgment in English, the entire order cannot be declared void, says the Madras High Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and P.N. Prakash made the observation while dismissing a batch of habeas corpus petitions moved by Suganiya and others, relatives of 14 persons who were convicted and sentenced for various offences by the First Additional District and Sessions Judge, Tiruvallur, on December 21, 2015.\n\nThe main contention of the petitioners was that the judge had written the judgments in English, violating the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Official Language Act.\n\nThe petitioners argued that since the judge has violated the Act, which was upheld by a Division Bench of the High Court, the entire orders should be declared void ab initio and the consequent detention of the accused declared illegal.\n\nWhen the petitions came up for hearing, the Bench brought to the notice of the petitioners\u2019 counsel that the habeas corpus petitions cannot be maintained as the prisoners were detained pursuant to an order a court of competent jurisdiction, which can be challenged only by way of an appeal.",
