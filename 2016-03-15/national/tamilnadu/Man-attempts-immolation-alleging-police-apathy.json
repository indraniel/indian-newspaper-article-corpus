Kumar\n\nAmid high drama, a 45-year-old man along with his family members attempted self-immolation at the Collectorate here on Monday.\n\nPolice said Ravi from Mudaliarpet was dejected over lack of action on repeated petitions he had submitted to the police against his brothers over a property dispute.\n\nRavi had stated that his brothers Dasarathan and Paramaguru had refused to vacate their ancestral house even after he had brought the portions and settled the amount a few years ago. He alleged that his brothers had disconnected electricity and water supply to his house and threatened him of dire consequences.\n\nSeeking action on his complaint, Ravi came along with his wife Gomathi and two minor daughters to the collectorate with a kerosene can. They doused themselves with kerosene and attempted self-immolation.\n\nPolice personnel thwarted their attempt immediately and made an enquiry with Ravi and promised to look into his complaint.",
