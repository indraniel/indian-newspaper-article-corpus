    "text": "A Coimbatore Court on Monday convicted three persons and sentenced them to two years rigorous imprisonment (RI) for allegedly beating a man, due to which he died on July 8, 2012. While the Rathinapuri Police registered it as a murder, IV \u2013 Additional District Judge G. Vijaya altered it to an incident of sudden provocation that caused his death.\n\nOn the day the incident took place, the victim Ponnaiyan of Tatabad was consuming alcohol in his four-wheeler in front of his house.\n\nHe asked his niece A. Amala (18) to dispose of the empty bottle in a nearby dump, when the accused R. Ranganathan (34), R. Nandhakumar (26) and N. Kannan (32) stopped her from doing so.\n\nThe girl informed Ponnaiyan about it and went indoors.\n\nAround 11.30 p.m., Ponnaiyan was seen arguing with the trio about the incident and the accused beat him.\n\nHis family and neighbours brought him back home and noticed that he was bleeding from his mouth and was going down.\n\nHe was rushed to a hospital where he died the same night.\n\nThey were also asked to give Rs. 50,000 each (totalling Rs. 1.5 lakh) as compensation to the family of the victim.",
