    "text": "Officials seized a consignment of new stainless steel utensils transported by bus from Kumbakonam to Salem near here on Monday.\n\nWith the model code of conduct in vogue, officials have mounted a strict vigil on movement of things and vehicles in the district. Flying squads and monitoring teams have been scanning vehicles for unauthorised transport of consignments that could influence voters. During one such inspection, a team lead by Special Tahsildar Devianayaki spotted a TNSTC bus from Kumbakonam to Hosur carrying on its top three huge bags and intercepted the vehicle near Thittai Road between Kumbakonam and Thanjavur and enquired the crew about the bags.\n\nConductor Srinivasan and driver Murugan replied that they were new stainless steel utensils booked in Kumbakonam and bound for a shop in Salem. The transporter had paid proper luggage charges for the consignment, they said.\n\nThough they allowed the bus to proceed to Thanjavur Old Bus Stand, they again intercepted the bus and seized the gunny bags containing the utensils and found them to be of uniform size and shape. The three bags had 275 small stainless steel kudam, 100 bigger kudam, 294 other utensils and they were worth at Rs. 35,000. The consignor had paid Rs. 432 for the freight charges.\n\nFearing that the utensils could be distributed to voters in the garb of transporting them to a shop, the officials seized the consignment.",
