It is located close to Kerala border.\n\nThe pristine location provides a bird\u2019s eye view of Indira Gandhi National Park under Anamalai Tiger Reserve, and the beautiful Manjampatti valley. The spot is not known to many as the entry to the area is presently restricted. Any access needs permission from Forest Department officials. The \u2018human face\u2019 can be seen on the edge of a rock that has nearly 1km deep gorge on one side.\n\n\u201cTourism potential in the area is yet to be explored. The access to the top of the rock formation is easier from Kerala side,\u201d said District Forest Officer A. Periasamy.\n\nSome of the nature conservationists were of the opinion that it would be better if certain locations inside the forest remain cut off from the tourists as its virginity could be lost once unrestricted flow of people happens.",
