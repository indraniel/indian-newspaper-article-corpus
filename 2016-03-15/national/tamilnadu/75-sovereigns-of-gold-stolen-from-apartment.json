    "text": "They decamp with 75 sovereigns of gold jewellery\n\nAround 75 sovereigns of gold jewellery were stolen from an apartment on Portuguese Street, Sowcarpet on Sunday evening. The burglars broke open the lock and entered the house of Mohammad Niyaz around 6:30 p.m., when no one was present. They also latched all the neighbouring houses.\n\n\u201cI was about to go out, but when I tried opening the door, it was latched from outside. I rang up a friend who came and opened it. That\u2019s when we saw that the lock in Niyaz\u2019s house was lying on the floor and the door was half-open,\u201d said Saleema, a neighbour. Mr. Niyaz and his family of six have been living in the neighbourhood for 10 years.\n\n\u201cI was at home the whole day with my family and we stepped out at 6 p.m. to go to Forum Mall in Vadapalani. In an hour, I got a call from the shopkeeper below informing me about the break-in. I rushed home and saw that our safe was broken,\u201d said Niyaz.\n\nAn FIR has been filed at the Seven Hills Police Station. Police are investigating.",
