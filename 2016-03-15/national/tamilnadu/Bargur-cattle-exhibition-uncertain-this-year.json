    "text": "Bargur cattle rearers have lost hope for conduct of the annual exhibition this year, following the notification for elections to Tamil Nadu Assembly by the Election Commission of India\n\nThe Department of Animal Husbandry initiated exhibition of Bargur cattle two years back, and has been able to galvanise rearing of the unique breed.\n\nThe second annual exhibition conducted during the same month last year at Thurasanampalayam village attracted hundreds of rearers. The Department enhanced the prize-money last year for encouraging better participation.\n\nNo funding\n\nThis year, the Department has not received funding for the purpose even before the date for Assembly elections was announced, it is learnt.\n\nThe uncertainty in conduct of annual exhibition is a disappointment for buyers too. The cattle breed is sought after by farmers to plough fields and draw carts, and for fertigating the soil with its dung of high manure value.\n\nThe solace for rearers, however, is progress in the work on Bargur Cattle Research Station being carried out by the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS)\n\nThe research station for indigenous breed cattle is coming up on a 50-acre site.\n\nThe facility, sources said, will be established over five years at an investment of Rs. 6 crore.\n\nThe initial instalment of Rs. 1.37 crore has already been released.\n\nThe Research Station will have the mandate of increasing milk yield of the cattle through selective breeding.",
