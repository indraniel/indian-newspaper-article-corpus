Nagar under Kangayam municipality would be telling the candidates who plan to approach them seeking votes in the coming Assembly elections.\n\nOver 100 families are residing in the locality with the free house site pattas issued by the State Government more than two decades back.\n\nPublic toilets\n\n\u201cWe will vote for the candidate who sounds sincere in looking into our demands like upgrading the earthen roads, setting up public toilets for women and children and construction of storm water drains, among a few other things\u201d, L. Sivakumar, a resident, told The Hindu .\n\nElected representatives\n\nS. Karuppaiah, State joint general secretary of Dalit Liberation Movement- Tamil Nadu, said the issues had already been taken to the notice of the district administration and elected representatives on many occasions without getting the grievances redressed.\n\n\u201cThe families in the hamlet are residing in the houses constructed by the government and have ration cards, Aadhar cards, electors\u2019 photo identity cards and electricity connection. It is pathetic that even for such a regularised colony, the basic facilities for the residents are far from satisfactory\u201d, he said.",
