Hence, she sought the operator\u2019s assistance, who locked it properly . When the ride started, the lock became loose and she started shouting for help. Khaja held onto her, but due to the speed, she was thrown off the giant wheel and severely injured her left leg,\u201d explained Mr. Backi.\n\nShe was rushed to the Government Royapettah Hospital. \u201cHer bone was sticking out. We subsequently shifted her to a private hospital near R.K. Salai, where she underwent a surgery on Monday afternoon,\u201d said Mr. Backi.\n\nA tourism official at Island Grounds suspected that Samema Banu had not buckled up properly.\n\n\u201cWhen officials checked, the lock was working properly. Besides, over 60 days have passed and there have not been any accidents,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that such rides were done on a contract basis. \u201cThose selected to operate such equipment at the trade fair have to submit a safety certificate. Without this, they will not be allowed to operate such entertainment machines,\u201d added the official.\n\nExperts said that the government should check the safety of the equipment before allowing them to be operated at a trade fair.\n\n\u201cThe Government should be very strict when it comes to safety. Many a time, the equipment are locally manufactured,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Backi said that he had lodged a complaint at the Triplicane police station.",
