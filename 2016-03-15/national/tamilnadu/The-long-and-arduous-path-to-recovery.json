    "text": "On January 29 last year, Senthamizh Anbu was supposed to go on a trip to Gokarna, Karnataka. On the night of January 28, he was returning home from work at night with a friend on a two-wheeler, when he met with an accident.\n\n\u201cWe were crossing the Keelkattalai junction when a buffalo, running across the road, hit my knee and the rear wheel of the bike. My friend, who was riding, had turned the bike towards the median, but luckily the bike did not fall. There is no proper lighting on that stretch and I could barely see the buffalo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 26-year-old had been hit so badly, that for a little while, his vision was hazy. The 108 ambulance eventually took him to a hospital, where doctors found he had a ligament tear and a bone injury in the knee.\n\nMore than a year on, the IT professional says, his leg has still not completely recovered.\n\n\u201cI used to be a badminton player and a sprinter. I play badminton now, but it\u2019s not the same as before. And I haven\u2019t sprinted since the accident,\u201d he said.\n\nAwareness drive\n\nIt took over two months for him to recover, and even with his office\u2019s insurance paying for most of the costs, Senthamizh\u2019s family still had to pay some medical costs. Today, he along with friends and colleagues conduct road safety awareness campaigns at schools, colleges and traffic signals. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet that day and had the bike fallen on the median, my injuries would have been much worse,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors who treat road traffic accident victims say that they can cause a myriad of problems \u2013 apart from a loss of income to the family, it can cause disabilities, lower the quality of life and sometimes, the victim cannot go back to the job he once had.\n\n\u201cWe operate on between 30 and 40 cases a month. Ninety per cent of them are male, and most are between the ages of 20 and 30. Rash driving, drunken driving, overtaking buses, jumping traffic signals and sometimes having more than two people on the bike are some of the causes,\u201d said M.M. Sankar, professor of neurosurgery, Government Stanley Hospital.\n\nDr. Sankar explained that with a mild injury, patients can recover within a month, but with severe head injuries it could take six months and even then, manual labour and some other kinds of jobs may not be possible.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not only the patient\u2019s income that is lost \u2013 usually, a family member is there throughout at the hospital and their income too, may be lost,\u201d he said.\n\nDisability\n\nDisability is another issue, said S. Balu, head of the emergency department at SRM Institutes for Medical Science, Vadapalani.\n\n\u201cSome victims become paralysed. Some don\u2019t have insurance. Some victims have more than one injury \u2013 for instance to the head, abdomen, chest or fractures,\u201d he said.\n\nA majority of the 20 to 25 cases the hospital sees per month are of those in the age group of 18 to 50 \u2013 the working age group.\n\nFor many like Senthamizh, an accident is not just short-term pain. It has long-term consequences.\n\nDisabilities, loss of income and lower\n\nquality of life are\n\namong the issues accident victims face",
