The unit was originally commissioned in May, 1985.\n\nWith the successful commissioning of Unit-7 at Barauni TPS, BHEL has showcased its strength in renovation and modernisation of old thermal power plants through in-house state-of-the-art technology, engineering capabilities and incorporating the latest products and systems in renovated units, a BHEL press release said.\n\nThe synchronization of the unit comes close on the heels of the successful re-commissioning of Muzaffarpur Units-1&2 (110 MW each), and uprating of Bhatinda Units-3&4 of PSPCL and Harduaganj Unit-7 of UPRVUNL, from 110 MW to 120 MW. Of the 218 utility sets of 110-210 MW rating supplied by BHEL in the country, about 142 have outlived their designed economic life of 25 years.\n\nOf these 142 sets, renovation and modernisation of 38 sets has already been taken up by the respective utilities. Power utilities find renovation and modernisation opportunity helpful in capacity uprating and life extension. It also improves their performance level in terms of improving efficiency and reducing emissions, as the Ministry of Environment and Forest has stipulated stringent emission norms for the power plants installed in the country\n\nBHEL provides effective solutions to utilities for controlling to the prescribed emission norms, the release added.",
