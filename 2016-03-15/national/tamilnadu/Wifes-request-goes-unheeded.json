    "text": "After several rounds of dialogue between the protesters and police, Shankar's family received his body from CMCH in the late hours of the day. But, his wife could not see his body despite pleading with hospital authorities to allow her to see his face. A few Dalit outfits came to her support and argued with the authorities to allow her to attend the final rites and continue with the treatment once the formalities were completed. Dalit Viduthalai Katchi Leader Sengottaiyan said the issue was taken to the CM\u2019s Special Cell.\n\nIn the meanwhile, as soon as the body of Shankar was brought from Coimbatore after the autopsy, a large section of people resorted to protest at Komaralingam.\n\nThey did not allow the body to be taken out of the ambulance. Among other things they demanded that the police provide proof of arrest of the assailants. The police had to resort to a mild lathi-charge.",
