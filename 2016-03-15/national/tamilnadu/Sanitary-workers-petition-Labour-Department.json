There are close to 600 sanitary workers engaged in the contract basis in the four zones of the Corporation.\n\n\u201cEvery month, at least Rs. 4,000 is being deducted from our salary of Rs. 9,000 towards PF, ESI, income tax and insurance. But, we are yet to receive our PF and ESIC account numbers. We have been asking our contractors for nearly two years but they are yet to provide the details,\u201d a worker said.\n\nThe workers have not received the ESIC cards till date. \u201cWe are waiting for the cards for two years. Though the amount is deducted from our salaries, we are forced to spend for medical expenses in the absence of the card. The contractors say they will get the cards but again, nothing happens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sanitary workers have been engaged by the Corporation since 2009. Initially, they were part of the self help groups, and were engaged on contract basis in 2014. The workers said their earlier petitions to the Corporation\u2019s Commissioner did not fetch any result.\n\nThe workers also said that their salaries were disbursed only after the 25th of every month.",
