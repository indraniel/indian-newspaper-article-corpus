Thirumavalavan on Monday said that over 70 per cent of murders reported in the State over the last five years were committed for communal/caste reasons. He demanded that the Centre enact an Act to deal with such crimes.\n\nMr. Thirumavalavan made the statement while participating in a hunger strike organised by the party\u2019s lawyers\u2019 wing near the Madras High Court premises. \u201cSuch incidents occur due to the lethargic approach and inaction of the State government towards the issue. The government is least concerned about the crime; no preventive measures are taken.\u201d\n\nThe one-day token hunger strike was organised to press for social justice in appointment of judges in the High Court. \u201cWhile reservation is being followed in appointments to IAS, IPS and even in the MP, MLA elections, it is not followed in appointment of High Court and Supreme Court judges,\u201d Mr. Thirumavalavam said.\n\nHe said if appointments were made in proportionate to the population of each community, at least 19 out of the 75 posts would go to the Dalit community. \u201cAppointments to the judiciary must be made through competitive examinations similar to the UPSC, as an alternative to the present collegium system,\u201d Mr. Thirumavalavan suggested.",
