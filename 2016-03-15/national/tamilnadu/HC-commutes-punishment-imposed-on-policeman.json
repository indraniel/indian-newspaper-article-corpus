    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has commuted the punishment imposed on a police constable accused of abducting and assaulting his colleague at Tamil Nadu Special Police training camp at Manimuthar in Ambasamudram Taluk in Tirunelveli district in 2006.\n\nPartly allowing a writ petition filed by P. Periaraja in 2008, Justice A. Selvam modified an order passed by Director General of Police on May 15, 2008 and reduced the punishment from stoppage of annual increment for two years with cumulative effect to just one year without cumulative effect.\n\nThe judge pointed out that charges of abduction and assault remained unproved in the criminal proceedings since the reported victim himself deposed in court that he was neither abducted nor assaulted by the writ petitioner. He had made a similar deposition in the departmental enquiry too.\n\nHence, a lenient view could be taken in the matter and the punishment could be commuted, the judge observed.",
