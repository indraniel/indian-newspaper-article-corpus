Ramadoss said.\n\nHuman rights based approach\n\n\u201cSo long, the DMK and AIADMK governments have been acting like kings and queens, treating the people like their subjects. The government\u2019s services have been handed down to people like charity. Such monarchic mindset should be brought to an end, and the PMK is putting forth a human rights based approach in TN politics,\u201d he told reporters on Monday.\n\nHe added that the government services were the rights of people.\n\n\u201cThe PMK will take a pledge to see that people are repository of sovereignty. In Tamil Nadu, the parties at the helm of the government have no respect for the social contract, on which a government is built,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Ramadoss observed that there has been no good governance, accountability and transparency in the State. He said the party will follow the principles of social democracy, and treat every individual as equal with no differences of religion, caste, language and gender.\n\nAsked whether any party has approached PMK for alliance talks, he said that the BJP had approached them but refused to divulge any other information.\n\nOn reports that the multi-cornered fight might go in favour of the AIADMK, he termed them as rumours.",
