As the space was inadequate, villagers pooled in funds and purchased 54 cents of land near the school, said Sivakumar, a villager. About 400 students study here.\n\nTenders floated\n\n\u201cWe registered the land in the name of the Chief Educational Officer of Vellore. The Public Works Department had floated tenders in January this year and the work was allotted,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, when the construction work was being initiated, an owner of a poultry farm nearby claimed ownership of the land.\n\n\u201cBut he did not possess any documents for the land. So, we approached the Superintendent of Police. The police asked us to get a letter from the CEO,\u201d he said.\n\nThe opposite party had also filed a civil suit regarding the land. Revenue officials too verified the ownership of the land.\n\n\u201cThe police said they will provide protection to start construction if the CEO gives a letter. So, we resorted to this protest to urge the CEO to give the letter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe villagers gave up the protest after police officers intervened.\n\nCEO R. Bhoopathy said he has instructed the school headmaster to take legal opinion on the further course of action.\n\nStaged a sit-in demanding the Education Dept. officials to construct building",
