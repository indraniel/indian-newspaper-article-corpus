    "text": "\u2018Pudhiya Sindhanai\u2019 seeks tough punishment for offenders\n\nAn appeal to amend the existing provisions of the Representation of People Act and Indian Penal Code was made so as to eradicate the menace of bribing voters.\n\nIn a representation to President Pranab Mukherjee and other authorities, a social welfare organisation called \u2018Pudhiya Sindhanai\u2019, based at Puducherry, made this plea.\n\nThe organisation president N.Balamurugan said bribing the voters had become very familiar among people and was named as Thirumangalam formula wherein for a single vote, Rs. 500 to Rs. 2,000 was given by the political parties.\n\nHe said that no political party or no particular candidate contesting in the election would directly involve themselves in handing over money to a particular voter but would distribute cash through a middleman.\n\nLaw lenient\n\n\u201cIt is also pertinent to note the fact that the particular person distributing the cash does not have any fear of the Representation of People Act, 1951 for the reason that the punishment for the particular offence of bribing the voters is very lenient. Law must be strong enough to eradicate corruption. While enacting the Representation of People Act, the legislature would not even have thought that bribing a voter plays a vital role as stated above and in later days it would slowly endanger the democracy and destroy our country,\u201d Mr. Balamurugan said.\n\nHe also appealed to the President and authorities concerned to amend the provision 171 (e) of Indian Penal Code by amending the punishment clause.\n\nThe offenders must be imprisoned for a minimum of three years and maximum of 10 years. In addition to this they must also be levied a fine of Rs 1 lakh, he suggested.",
