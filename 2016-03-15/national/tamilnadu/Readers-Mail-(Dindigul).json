    "text": "Exorbitant charge\n\nAbout half of the total households in Ramanathapuram have opted for sewage connection. A sum of Rs. 7,000 has been fixed as charge for sewage connection and Rs. 12,000 for drinking water connection by the municipality. Altogether, a resident has to pay Rs. 25,000, including labour charges, for getting these connections. As most of the residents live below poverty line, the exorbitant levy seems to be a punishment. The residents are put to untold hardship by this burden and the municipality has not taken steps to minimise the levy. Hench, half of the residents are yet to pay for the connections. I request the Collector to take necessary action to bring down the sewage and drinking water connection charges.\n\nG. Nagasamy,\n\nRamanathapuram\n\nImprove industrial activities\n\nI would like to highlight issues facing southern districts. Urgent steps are required to improve industrial activities in these districts.\n\nThe Nanguneri Special Economic Zone in Tirunelveli district is yet to become full-fledged.\n\nThe Sethusamudram project has been crying for attention. Immediate steps are required to expand the Tuticorin airport and introduce night flights, apart from increasing the number of services. I request the authorities to take steps in this direction.\n\nP. Senthil Saravana Durai,\n\nVazhavallan.",
