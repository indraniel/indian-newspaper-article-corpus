    "text": "Response by political parties to the request made by the district administration for cleaning up walls of advertisements has been lukewarm, according to official sources.\n\nWhile the parties have removed hoardings and flags promptly, the same could not be said of the paintings on walls. But, rather than waiting for the political parties to respond, the local bodies are well into the process of cleaning up the walls themselves.\n\nSymbols are smudged and the portraits and inscriptions are being given lime coating to the extent of making them invisible, the sources said.\n\nIn a recent communication, the district administration made it clear to political parties that no advertisement would be permitted in the urban areas, and as for rural parts, the permission of the owners of buildings and the approval of the Returning Officers of the respective constituency must be sought for putting up posters, banners and paintings.",
