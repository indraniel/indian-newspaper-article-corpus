NGOs will also play a role in the functioning of the groups, which includes preventing distribution of money to voters.\n\nFour or five volunteers from each of the 3,699 booths in the Chennai District will be identified this week.\n\nBooth-level officers have started the process of identifying volunteers from the residential areas that a polling booth will cater to.\n\nHowever, the Election Commission faces challenges in implementing this move. Some of the booth-level officials said residents were yet to show enthusiasm in volunteering.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to visit colleges to find volunteers. But many booths do not have dedicated volunteers. Many of the employees in the age group of 21 to 29 seem unwilling to join,\u201d said an official. The volunteers would also report violations, in any, of the model code of conduct by political parties. An official said Chennai District would require at least 14,796 volunteers.",
