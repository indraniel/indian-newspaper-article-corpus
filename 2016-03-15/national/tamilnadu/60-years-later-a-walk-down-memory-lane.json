    "text": "A group of alumni of Rosary Matriculation School, who were in class IV in 1955-56, came together after 60 years to relive those good old days.\n\nPrabha Sridevan, former judge of Madras High Court, who initiated the alumni meeting said, \u201cI still remember how we would walk past our headmistress\u2019 room quietly and then, start whispering. We were reminiscing about those moments. When you age, perhaps, you want to see and meet those you grew up with,\u201d she said.\n\nN. Ravi, director of Kasturi and Sons Limited, took part in the alumni meet. Others who attended include Malathi Subramanian, Rama Vijayakumar, Umayal Narayanan, Lakshmi Kumar, L. Lakshman, Nagaraj, R. Shanker, Ravi Narayanaswami and Girija Shanker.\n\nC.R.L. Narasimhan, an alumnus of the school, said, \u201cRemembering the past was taken to mean that members will exchange information in an informal manner on how they have fared in the intervening 60 years.\u201d\n\nThough the meeting was planned many months ago, it had to be rescheduled twice owing to the rains, he said. \u201cA visit to the school premises as it existed then \u2014 it has since shifted to an adjoining building \u2014 evoked feelings of nostalgia. Some of us could actually recognise the classrooms,\u201d he added.\n\nClass IV students from Rosary Matriculation School of 1955-56 came together to relive the good old days",
