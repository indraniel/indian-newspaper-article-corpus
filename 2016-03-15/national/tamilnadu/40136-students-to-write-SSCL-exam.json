The examinations will be held at 144 centres across the district and 144 headmasters have been appointed as chief invigilators. This apart, about 2,100 teachers will be deployed for invigilation. Flying squads with about 175 teachers have been formed to check malpractices in the examination, Collector K.S. Palanisamy said in a press release. Scribes have been nominated for 118 visually impaired students, he said.\n\nParties cautioned\n\nDistrict Collector K.S. Palanisamy has cautioned political parties against using children in election campaign, either directly or indirectly. In a press release, Mr. Palanisamy pointed out that employing children below the age of 14 has been prohibited under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. Election rules clearly prohibit use of children in campaign. Those found involving children for campaigning would face legal action, he said.",
