    "text": "Powerloom weavers in Coimbatore and Tirupur districts have sought a common marketing centre to sell the fabric directly to retailers and wholesale dealers.\n\nThis is the main demand of the weavers from the candidates who will contest the assembly elections this year from the two districts.\n\nAccording to E.Ra. Velusamy and C. Palanisamy, who represent the job-working powerloom weavers in the two districts, the powerloom units here manufacture about one crore metres of fabric a day. These are sent to different States and exported after value-addition too.\n\nMajority of the powerloom units here do job-work for master weavers. If there is a common marketing facility, the job-working weavers can sell the fabric they manufacture, get better prices, and scale-up production capacities.\n\nAnother major demand of the powerloom units in the two districts is reduction of Value Added Tax on yarn. The tax on yarn now is five per cent in Tamil Nadu while it is just two per cent in other States. This has affected the textile mills and the weavers. Textile units in the State can develop only if the VAT is reduced to two per cent, they say.",
