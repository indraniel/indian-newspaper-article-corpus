    "text": "Stating that accumulation of garbage due to presence of vegetable market is causing sanitation issue, residents near Jamia Masjid staged road block here on Monday. They said that the highways department evicted the residents for laying new roads before 10 years.\n\nBut, the corporation had instead used the space for vegetable market. Though residents opposed it, the corporation said that the market will be functioning only temporarily and would be relocated. However, after 10 years the market continues to function. Garbage from the market is dumped in the River Thirumanimutharu causing sanitation issue. Viral fever had already claimed the life of three persons and recently a 7-year-old child died due to the poor sanitation in the area. The area became a breeding place for mosquitoes, they added.\n\nHowever, no steps have been taken so far either to clean the river or relocate the market, protesters added.\n\nTraffic was disrupted for over two hours and officials and police held talks with them. Later, following an assurance by the officials, residents withdrew their protest.",
