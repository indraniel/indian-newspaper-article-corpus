Every question was tricky, as a result of which many of us found it tough to finish the paper on time and many students, including the top scorers in schools, were crying after the exam,\u201d said Shreya, a student.\n\nA maths teacher from a school in Chennai admitted that it was a standard paper where the difficulty levels were high. \u201cClass 10 exams are usually easy. For Class 12, students will have to really prepare well. This year, the question paper was a bit difficult. Compared to last year when only two questions were difficult, this year\u2019s question paper had more complicated sums which were unfamiliar,\u201d she said.\n\nN. Divya said her son, who expected to score a centum, would find it hard to get above 90 marks. \u201cFor science students like him who want to pursue engineering, the cut-off marks will automatically come down now and we will be in no position to compete with State board students who score centums, making it impossible for us to secure seats on merit,\u201d she said. Questioning why not many sums from the NCERT syllabus found a place in the paper, a student said, \u201cFor many of us who just went by the prescribed textbook and did not prepare with other guides, it was a difficult paper to crack. Online Forums Complaint Board and Indian Consumer Complaints Forum exploded with posts from students who demanded leniency in correction and lashed out against the Board for a tough paper. Many students took to sharing their grievances on Facebook and urged other students to post on the forums for the CBSE to take note. Parents and students from the city sent tweets to Union Minister Smriti Irani about the \u201ctough\u201d paper.\n\nChemistry paper also tough\n\nState Board students taking the Plus II students Chemistry exam also said the difficulty level was much beyond their expectations. \u201cA few of the questions were tricky for us and it was overall a challenging paper,\u201d said K. Bhavani, a student.\n\n(With inputs from S.P. Saravanan in Salem).",
