Ragu\n\nAt least a hundred engineering college students raised slogans demanding accountability for the successive deaths of four engineering college students \u2014 Ajith Kumar (St. Joseph College of Engineering, Sriperumbudur), Abinath (Sri Sairam Engineering College, West Tambaram), Vignesh (Kathir College of Engineering, Coimbatore), Gunaseelan (Mahendra College of Engineering, Namakkal) \u2014 from their college managements, outside Anna University campus here on Monday.\n\nThe students of Sri Sairam Engineering College and St. Joseph College of Engineering rejected the claim that depression was the cause of their peers\u2019 suicide.\n\nWhile Abinath\u2019s parents said that he had told them about the harassment by college authorities, Ajith Kumar\u2019s friend said that Ajith was often humiliated for \u2018studying engineering for free\u2019 even by senior staff the college.\n\n\u201cHe was studying engineering on a government scholarship. This humiliation led him to take such a decision. The management is responsible,\u201d charged Ajith Kumar\u2019s friend.\n\nThe students who had come from seven colleges said that these were \u2018institutional murders\u2019 and called for a complete reform of these colleges.\n\n\u201cWe demand that a compensation of Rs. 20 lakh be given to families of the deceased. And, we want the government to ensure that the colleges have an elected student union to deal with their grievances,\u201d said Kannan of Students Federation of India.\n\nIn a statement released to the media, Saiprakash Leo Muthu, CEO, Sri Sairam Engineering College, said that Abinath was \u2018not very keen on studying engineering\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis lack of interest in pursuing engineering reflected in his performance in the various tests conducted. In the recent university examination results too, he had failed in 4 subjects out of 6,\u201d the statement said. His poor performance had disturbed him and he did not attend the classes on the fateful day (11 March 2016), the report added.\n\nRepresentatives met officials of Directorate of Technical Education and explained their grievances. \u201cThey have assured us that a decision on having an elected students union will be taken by the end of this month. They said that they will ensure that four students, who were being pushed out for protesting against Sairam management, will not be harassed by the management,\u201d said one of the organisers of the protest. The students said that they would continue to protest until there is a concrete solution.\n\nThe students say they would continue to protest until there is a concrete solution",
