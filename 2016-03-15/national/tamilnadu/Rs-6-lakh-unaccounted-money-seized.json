Though the person in the car claimed that the cash was being taken for depositing in a bank, officials said that there were no documents except for a small challan with just the amount written on it. The cash was seized and deposited in the treasury. The persons in possession of the cash were asked to claim it back after submitting relevant documents.\n\nAs per the MCC, which has come into force on March 4, carrying more than Rs. 50,000 without appropriate documents has been banned.
