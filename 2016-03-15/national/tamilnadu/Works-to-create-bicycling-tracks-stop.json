Even the Public Works Department wrote to the Coimbatore Corporation in this regard.\n\nIn this backdrop, the corporation appears to be going slow on laying the track.\n\nA look at the tank suggested that no track construction was in progress.\n\nCoimbatore Corporation officials said that work was on and model code of conduct would have no impact as the civic body had started the work long ago.\n\nThey added that senior officials were seized of the matter and that with private participation, the corporation would definitely develop the bund.\n\nThe tank with a bund length of 5 km is part of the Noyyal eco system.",
