Sathyamoorthy\n\nThe carnivore that mauled an estate worker on Friday in the Nilgiris continued to keep police and forest personnel on their toes, while workers remained indoors and children were escorted to schools/exams by gun-toting police and Special Task Force personnel.\n\nThe carnivore, suspected to be a tiger, mauled the tea estate worker near Wood Briar Estate in Devarshola near Gudalur and the incident came to light on Saturday morning.\n\nThe Forest Department installed nine cages and 30 camera traps to track the animal. Three teams of forest personnel, police, STF and estate workers are on the job.\n\nOn Sunday, tiger images came up with snare injuries on its hind legs and stomach. On Monday, forest personnel on inspecting the cages and cameras were disappointed on not getting even a single image. However, fresh pug marks were noticed. Now, the patrolling will be confined to the movement of the tiger within one to two km radius.\n\nTree top machans have also been set up. Forest Veterinarian teams are ready with their paraphernalia to dart the animal.\n\nOfficials pointed out that the tiger would have consumed closer to 20 kg of meat on Friday night. They expect it to venture out as three days have gone by. The cages have been filled with red meat and goats to trap the animal.\n\nThe police took 15 students from Karisanakolli village near the Estate in their vehicles to schools and back.",
