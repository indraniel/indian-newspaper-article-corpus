    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to entertain a plea of Pondicherry University Vice-Chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy, challenging show-cause notices issued to her by the Ministry of Human Resource Development based on adverse reports against her.\n\nA Bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur asked Ms. Krishnamurthy to give her reply to the show cause notice issued by the President. The Bench while asking her to reply to the show cause notices said it was not going into the merits of the matter. Ms. Krishnamurthy had challenged the Madras High Court order dismissing her pleas against the show-cause notices issued to her by the Ministry. The Ministry had acted after two fact-finding committees examined allegations which included her qualifications. \u2014 PTI",
