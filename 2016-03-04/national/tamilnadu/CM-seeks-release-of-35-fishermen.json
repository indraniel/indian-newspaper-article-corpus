    "text": "Writes to Prime Minister reminding him of her earlier demands\n\nSoon after the arrest of eight fishermen from the State, who were detained by the Sri Lankan Navy on Thursday, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his personal intervention to release all 35 fishermen, who are presently in the custody of the Lankan authorities.\n\n\u201cI urge your personal intervention in this matter and request you to direct the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with the Sri Lankan authorities in a concrete and decisive manner so as to secure the immediate release of 35 fishermen and 73 fishing boats including the eight fishermen and their two fishing boats apprehended on March 3,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa wrote in her letter to Mr. Modi, which was released to the press. Recalling her earlier demands with the Centre, Ms. Jayalalithaa said she had also sought assistance of Rs.1520 crore for deep sea fishing and infrastructure.\n\nThe boats, presently in the Lankan custody, were to be released too along with the fishermen, she urged.\n\n\u201cThe prolonged detention and disuse of these boats even through the severe North-East monsoon would have caused extensive and irretrievable damage,\u201d she said.",
