    "text": "The Annual Credit Plan (ACP) prepared by the Lead Bank has envisaged a \u2018credit flow potential\u2019 of Rs. 8,756 crore to \u2018priority sectors\u2019 during 2016-17 financial year, which is 10.58 per cent growth over the plan targets of 2015-16 fiscal.\n\nProjections\n\nThis time, the ACP projections were pegged a little below the credit flow projections of Rs. 9,989.24 crore mentioned in the Potential Linked Credit Plan (PLCP) of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development for 2016-17.\n\nThe PLCP is usually taken as the base document for the preparation of ACP by the Lead Bank.\n\nOn the rationale behind the projections in the ACP, Lead District Manager V. Ganesan told The Hindu that the growth of 10.58 per cent was estimated considering the huge investments happened for setting up new entrepreneurial ventures in the district, good credit absorption in the priority sectors covering agriculture, MSME, and other sectors such as housing, education, and increase in the number of bank branches, all during the current financial year.\n\nA scan through the ACP document reveals that the most of the credit was projected to flow to MSME sector followed by agriculture and other priority sectors (OPS) that covers housing, education and social infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe project a credit potential of Rs. 5,434 crore to MSMEs, Rs. 2,564 crore to agriculture and allied activities and Rs. 758 crore to OPS,\u201d said Mr. Ganesan.",
