    "text": "Senior citizens throughout the State should be given free bus pass as given to those residing in Chennai, said Tamil Nadu Senior Citizens and Pensioners\u2019 Welfare Association here on Thursday.\n\nVarious resolutions were passed at its State executive committee meeting, chaired by State president Siva Somanathan. K.K. Kalidoss, district president, welcomed the gathering.\n\nThe members wanted 50 per cent concession on ticket fare in mofussil buses. Medical insurance scheme was not of much use to the pensioners. Even 10 per cent of the amount collected towards medical expenditure was not paid to the beneficiaries. Except for those who underwent surgery, it was of little help. Hence, the government should consider withdrawing the scheme, they said.\n\nThe meeting wanted the government to cancel the new pension scheme. Forming a commission to look into the issue indicated that the government was indulging in delaying tactics. Journalist pension should be increased on a par with State government pensioners, the meeting resolved.",
