    "text": "Residents of Kandaneri, a village in Vellore district, have been knocking the doors of the district administration to stop the unauthorised mining of sand from the Palar basin.\n\nWith the district administration reportedly displaying a nonchalant attitude, a Public Interest Litigation plea with the help of Satta Panchayat was filed against sand mining, in Madras High Court against the sand mining. But instead of putting a check on unauthorised mining more truck loads of sand are being transported complained the residents of Kandaneri village. The members of Satta Panchayat made a video presentation of the illegal sand mining being carried out at the Palar basin, at a press conference here.",
