Ganapathi who assumed office as Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the university here on Thursday.\n\nAccording to him, select universities in the country including Madurai Kamaraj University and University of Madras were awarded the UPE status by University Grants Commission (UGC). The V-C said that efforts would be made to provide research facilities and publish research journals.\n\nOn the immediate priorities, Mr. Ganapathi said that the university would highlight the strengths before the NAAC committee that would be visiting the university on March 21and get a better score.\n\nEfforts would also be made to get Special Assistance Programme from the UGC for the departments that were yet to get it.\n\nAnswering newsmen, he said that he was unaware of the financial misappropriation allegations in the university and that he would verify records and necessitate appropriate action. Process of distributing degree certificates would also be quickened, he added.",
