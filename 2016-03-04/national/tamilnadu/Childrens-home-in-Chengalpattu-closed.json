His repeated application for recognition was reportedly not entertained by the officials concerned in view of the fact that the land on which the buildings were raised was very close to a waterbody in the area.\n\nHowever, the management of the orphanage continued with the service of providing shelter and education for the last five years.\n\nMeanwhile, the District Administration received a tip-off that this institution was not recognised by the government. Subsequently, officials made a surprise visit and shifted the children to the other orphanage.",
