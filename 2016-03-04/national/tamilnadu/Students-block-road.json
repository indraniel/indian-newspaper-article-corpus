Sources said the road roko went on for nearly 30 minutes during the morning hours prompting the intervention of the police. The students were irked over the reported rude behaviour of some bus conductors with them during travel. Police personnel came to the spot and held talks with the protesting students and parents who gave up their stir after sometime.",
