These idols were \u2014 and still are \u2014 special to every family in Ennore Kuppam.\n\n\u201cThe three gold idols of Krishna, Radha and Rukmini were gifted by the Britishers to our ancestors who lived close to the temple,\u201d says T. Rajendran, one of the village heads.\n\nThe Draupadi Amman temple is now located on the premises of the Ennore Thermal Power Station.\n\n\u201cUntil 1991, Ennore Kuppam was located where the thermal plant came up. However, we were given an alternative place and jobs as the power plant had to be constructed. We call this new place, which is a few kilometres from the thermal plant, Ennore Kuppam too,\u201d says C. Deepan, another resident of the village. Every family at Ennore Kuppam is aware of the history of the three golden idols, as narrated to them by their ancestors.\n\n\u201cDuring the British era, a ship carrying merchandise was passing by our hamlet and it stalled suddenly. Despite their best efforts, the crew could not get the ship moving,\u201d says K. Nataraj, another village head.\n\nSeeing the temple, the Britishers realised there was a village and approached the fishermen for help.\n\n\u201cAs adept fishermen, who had worked with many boats, our ancestors tried to fix the ship, but were unsuccessful. They urged the Britishers to offer a prayer at the temple, which they did. The crew promised to give something to the temple if the ship moved, and in an hour, the fault was fixed. The Britishers rewarded our ancestors with three golden idols of Krishna, Radha and Rukmini. Nobody knows how they had those idols in their possession. From that day, over 300 families living in the hamlet started worshiping the idols. In February 1991, the idols were stolen,\u201d says Srinivasan.\n\nOn Februrary 22, there was a clash between members of two families in which one person was stabbed.\n\n\u201cWe found out that the idols had been stolen by some members of those two families. We have now requested the police to take action against those who stole the idols,\u201d adds Deepan.\n\nThe police are investigating.\n\nLast week, a breakthrough was achieved in the 25-year-old mystery of the missing idols of the Draupadi Amman temple in Ennore Kuppam.",
