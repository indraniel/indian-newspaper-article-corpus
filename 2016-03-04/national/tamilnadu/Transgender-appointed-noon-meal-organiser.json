When I was studying class X, my parents started observing that I behave differently. Initially, I was advised to not to behave in that way. But as time progressed I faced neglect and finally my parents stopped supporting me. Hence, I had to give up my studies when I was in second year of my graduation\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter leaving college I was leading my life by collecting money from shops. I never liked that. I wanted to earn by working. I approached several shops and even a petrol bunk for a job but in vain. The job I now have gives me immense pleasure,\u201d she said.",
