Chidambaram College premises, which was closed on February 15, must be reopened so that it could continue to serve people, said District Passengers\u2019 Welfare Association here.\n\nM. Piramanayagam, secretary of the association, said here on Thursday that the counter was established in February 2013 under Member of Parliament\u2019s 1,000 Passenger Reservation System (PRS) scheme.\n\nIt was closed owing to recent policy changes in the Railway Board. It provided easy accessibility for people from Korampallam, Maravanmadam, Postal and Telegraph Colony, Millerpuram, Chidambara Nagar, Bryant Nagar and other localities in the western side of Thoothukudi. On an average, 60 to 100 tickets were booked daily from that counter.\n\nA representation was made to H. Raja, national secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party and Chairman, Railway Passenger Amenities Committee, to resume the service during a meeting at Vilathikulam recently.\n\nFurther, he suggested that the proposed \u2018Antyodaya Express,\u2019 a long distance superfast train for common people to facilitate unreserved travel, could be operated from Thoothukudi to Chennai Central station via Madurai and Salem.\n\nHe also suggested operation of train services from Thoothukudi to Shencottah and Thiruvananthapuram by utilising the Maniyachi bypass.\n\nDemand\n\nSeveral passengers had been demanding change in timings of departure and arrival of Thoothukudi-Mysore Express from both ends. It should depart from Thoothukudi at 6 p.m. instead of 4.40 p.m. and the train from Mysore must arrive Thoothukudi before 9 a.m., Mr. Piramanayagam said.",
