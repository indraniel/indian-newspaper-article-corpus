In towns and cities, apart from the routine tests, there are packages for all age groups. Those who need to have regular tests or a complete package can now book appointments online, get the results on mail \u2013 with a copy to the doctor, if needed, and have digital copies. Laboratories offer collection of samples at the doorstep, not only for the elderly but also others also.\n\nSome laboratories have restricted use of QR code also so that the results can be seen on the mobile phone.\n\nAccording to Senthil Kumar of Bioline Laboratory, with increasing awareness on health insurance coverage, diagnostic reports are becoming vital. For those with insurance cover, treatment is usually after proper diagnosis and getting a diagnostic report.\n\nIn the case of sharing information through email with the doctors, there is always a green channel to consult them for critical values. In the case of towns or cities where the laboratories have only a collection centre, some samples are sent to the nearest hospital that have emergency care and the others are transported to larger cities where there are more facilities.\n\nWith increasing awareness and instances of some diseases, now almost all the diagnostic centres have imported kits and facilities to do almost all the tests here.\n\nM.
