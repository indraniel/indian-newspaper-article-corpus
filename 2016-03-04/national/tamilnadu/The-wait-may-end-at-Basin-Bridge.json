However, a chunk of the project amount \u2014 Rs. 19 crore \u2014 was released during the Railway Budget 2015-16, Southern Railway officials told The Hindu.\n\nWith the balance amount\u2014 Rs. 8.4 crore \u2014 released as this year\u2019s outlay, work resumed at a brisk pace and will be completed by the end of April, they said.\n\nNo more delays\n\nThey said the one of the key benefits of the project is that trains will not be detained at Basin Bridge station to allow long-distance trains to pass through to Chennai Central station.\n\nOnce completed, the 2.2- kilometre-long line will ensure that the suburban trains enter MMC complex straight from Basin Bridge junction in a matter of minutes.\n\n\u201cWe get delayed every single day. We do not understand why no action was taken all these years,\u201d said P. Sathyamurthy, a central government employee and a resident of Pattabhiram.\n\nLosing attendance\n\nAccording to him, many people travelling from northern and western areas of the city and suburbs even ended up losing a day\u2019s attendance for turning up late for work regularly. \u201cMy superiors do not understand,\u201d Mr. Sathyamurthy added.\n\nOfficials said that with electric multiple unit trains waiting at Basin Bridge for express trains to pass through from both directions, it resulted in services lining up one behind the other till Perambur.\n\nOver 4.5 lakh passengers travel in close to 180 services every day on the Chennai Central\u2013Tiruvallur\u2013Arakkonam suburan sector, officials added.",
