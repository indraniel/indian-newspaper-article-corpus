Narayanasamy had already gone on record against the government making illegal appointments to the government service.\n\n\u201cIn the backdrop of Assembly elections, over thousand persons have been employed to the Public Works Department, Cooperative and Milk Producers\u2019 Union in violation of all norms and an order of the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\n\nR. Rajangam, secretary of CPI (M), alleged that the government was facilitating illegal appointments at the fag end of its term in order to get their votes.\n\nThe Chief Minister has been providing jobs through the back door to people, bypassing the Employment Exchange without addressing the issue of over 2.25 lakh people who had registered their names with the office, he alleged.\n\nIn 2009, the Madras High Court passed an order banning backdoor recruitments in all departments and co-operative institutions in the Union Territory. The then Congress regime said departmental proceedings would be initiated against the officials who were responsible for the backdoor appointments.\n\nHowever, at the fag end of tenure, about 5,000 people were recruited to public sector undertakings. After the AINRC came to power, they were removed from the posts.\n\nCPI secretary R. Viswanathan said the AINRC government was committing the same mistakes.\n\nThe government has been encouraging back door appointments in violation of all procedures, he alleged.",
