    "text": "An office assistant in subordinate judiciary in Erode district was issued a memo by a Sessions Court Judge seeking an explanation for not washing clothes properly at his residence. A copy of the memo issued on February 1 by the judge went viral on social media on Thursday.\n\nIn the memo, the judge had charged the office assistant, S. Vasanthi, with not properly washing clothes, particularly inner garments, and throwing the clothes out of disgust at his house. \u201cFurther when questioned about this by the official (judge) and (his) wife, you have answered back. Please explain within seven days, why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for this,\u201d the memo said.\n\nReplying to the memo on February 4, Ms.Vasanthi said she would ensure that such complaints would not arise in the future.\n\nHowever, on Thursday when The Hindu contacted her, Ms.Vasanthi said, \u201cI am being subjected to mean treatment. I was asked to do household chores. At one point, I simply refused to wash clothes. That was when I was issued the \u2018notice\u2019,\u201d she said over phone.\n\nThe 47-year-old had joined duty 10 years ago based on her seniority in the employment exchange. \u201cI had joined duty in the hope that I would work in an office environment. But some officials misused their position and made me do household chores,\u201d she said. The judge, who issued the memo, could not be reached over phone for comments.",
