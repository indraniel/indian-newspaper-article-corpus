Moorthy\n\nJibreel Oysul, chief of dental surgery unit in Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre here, has entered Limca Book of Records 2016 for the \u201cmost extraction and the largest collection of non-carious human teeth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to media persons on Thursday, Dr. Oysul said that he had extracted, processed and collected 10,000 teeth since January 2011, for study and research purposes in the hospital. He realised that many patients had lost their good teeth due to bad gums than dental caries. \u201cWe can overcome this situation by doing regular dental check-up and scaling. By brushing twice a day the teeth can be taken care of,\u201d he noted.\n\nThanking his team and hospital founder N. Sethuraman for according support and space to carry out such a voluminous study over the past five years, he said that food habits, proper chewing and cleaning of mouth after consuming eatables would keep the teeth in good form.\n\nAge was not a factor as even a 30-year-old might lose teeth.\n\nDr. Oysul recommended use of soft tooth brush than hard or medium brushes. Likewise, he recommended changing tooth brush every 90 days.\n\nImproper brushing may change not only the tooth alignment but may gradually lead to change in the face structure of an individual.\n\nThe State government should set a model by including dental awareness at the primary school level. The hospital, he said, had been conducting free dental camps in schools in the region as it was important to educate people on the need for clean teeth from childhood. Every Wednesday, the MMHRC offered free dental screening between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. for the last 10 years, he informed.\n\nOn the apprehensions about dental scaling, he said that there was no harm in scaling once a year and it would not take out the enamel.\n\nUsing ultrasonic vibrator, the dirt or food particles would be removed within 15 minutes.\n\nHe clarified that any dentist would only protect teeth and not remove them, which would be done as a last resort.",
