Every time, the door of Chief Minister\u2019s office opens, there is an attempt to surge into the room.\n\nA few women from a spinning unit at Mettupalayam have been waiting at the corridors since morning with a plea over non-payment of their salary.\n\nA group of engineering college students were in the earnest hope of getting financial assistance for their studies under the government scheme returned from the place with disappointment.\n\nA large number of people from rural areas have been waiting endlessly for getting free pattas and other assistance. Some of them were camping in Bharathi Park.\n\nPolitical functionaries were found roaming in an unusual manner around the government offices including the Legislative Complex, Public Works Department and Local Administration Department with bunch of papers .\n\nFor the last few days, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy\u2019s office resembled an employment exchange with scores of youth flocking the premises apparently after word spread that temporary jobs are being provided.\n\nS. Vijay Babu, an engineering graduate came with his aunt and mother from Moolakulam and was waiting anxiously to meet the Chief Minister but had to return disappointed. He said, \u201cWe heard that vacancies were available in the Public Works Department but didn\u2019t know the eligibility criteria. Our visit has been in vain.\u201d\n\nHowever, things were different for several others as they managed to go inside the chamber of the Chief Minister and got a scribbling on piece of paper. Then they came out from the rear door of the chamber and proceeded to an adjacent room. There they got some tokens and were advised to go to the departments where they can get temporary employment.\n\nAn office-bearer of government employees\u2019 association said taking a cue from previous government which appointed over 5,000 persons at the fag end of tenure, this government was also trying to sign out in a similar way. Under the previous regime, candidates were appointed as voucher staff and later they were made daily rated staff following protests or after joining AINRC. Even as they would get only 15 days of employment and a salary of Rs. 3,500 per month, many of the job seekers here have come with the hope of that their jobs would be regularised at a later stage, he added.\n\nR. Saravanan, president of Democratic Youth Federation of India said, \u201cThis office has been issuing backdoor appointments with an eye on polls. Several persons were appointed in this manner in the last one week at Amuthasurabi, Puducherry Distilleries, PONLAIT, Co-Operative Societies, KVK and Mother Theresa Research Institute.\u201d",
