    "text": "Four men, including someone posing as a journalist, were arrested in connection with a gold heist that took place in Triplicane in January. Imran, also known as Abdul Azeez, from Kodungaiyur, had planned the heist along with Rajendran, 27, from Triplicane.\n\nThe gang stole half a kg of gold and Rs. 11 lakh in cash at knife-point from a gold-testing shop. Police found that Imran used to frequent the shop on the pretext of testing gold. Since the shop collected IDs from visitors, the police could trace him and found out that he was a fake journalist. Imran confessed to the crime and police managed to nab Rajendran, Nazeer Basha and Geelani of Royapuram. Rs. 4 lakh was recovered. Some other members are absconding. \u2014Staff Reporter",
