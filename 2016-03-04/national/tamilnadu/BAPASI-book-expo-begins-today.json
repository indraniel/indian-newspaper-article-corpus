The BAPASI has got up the exhibition in the city following a request from the State government to host book fairs in district headquarters.\n\nThe government was extending the corporation ground, the venue at Anna Nagar in Thennur, at heavily subsidised rent, the organisers said.\n\n\u201cWe are now making a beginning in the city and have planned to make the event an annual affair in the city as per the request of the District Collector K.S. Palanisamy. We will gradually scale up the event in the city. Tiruchi being an educational hub with a high literacy rate, we hope that the people of the city will support the initiative in a big way,\u201d said Gandhi Kannadhasan, president, and K.S. Pugalendi, general secretary, BAPASI, addressing a press conference on the eve of the inaugural of the book fair in the city on Thursday.\n\nThe book fair will feature about 125 stalls and about one lakh titles. There will be fair mix of English and Tamil titles besides five stalls on educational multimedia.\n\nLeading publishers, including National Book Trust and distributors, would participate in the fair. Discounts would be on offer.\n\nAsked about the timing of the event coinciding with the public examinations this year, the organisers said the exhibition in Tiruchi would be held soon after the Chennai book fair from next year.\n\nThe book fair would be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. till March 13.",
