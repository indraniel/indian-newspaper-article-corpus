    "text": "The Jayalalithaa Government has got no real intention of releasing the seven convicts undergoing life term imprisonment in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, said Vaiko, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader.\n\nThe communication of the State Government to the Centre seeking its opinion on the State Government\u2019s decision to release all the seven accused was nothing but a gimmick played by the Jayalalithaa regime and a game to fool the Tamil society, Mr. Vaiko said while speaking to presspersons here on late Wednesday evening, at the end of the public meeting of the People\u2019s Welfare Front.\n\nThe Jayalalithaa regime will not take the bold decision of releasing the seven accused undergoing imprisonment for the past 25 years. The Chief Minister has no real human consideration in this issue and had always preferred to escape by passing on the buck to the Centre. If Jayalalithaa is really interested in releasing them, she should convene the cabinet meeting and adopt a resolution on releasing them under Article 161. The resolution should be forwarded to the Governor.\n\nLaunching a scathing attack on Ms. Jayalalithaa, Mr. Vaiko said that she has no sympathy for the accused. When Nalini sought parole for a month for assisting her seriously ill father recently, the State Government refused to release her on parole. Even for her father\u2019s death, she was given parole for just 12 hours.",
