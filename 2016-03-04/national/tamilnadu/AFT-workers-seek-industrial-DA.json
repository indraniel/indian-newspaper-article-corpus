    "text": "Workers attached to the spinning unit of Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mill owing allegiance to various trade unions on Thursday observed a day-long hunger strike in front of the mill demanding the government to provide industrial dearness allowance (IDA).\n\nThe agitators led by Ilangovan, secretary of the Joint Action Committee, said that the government should implement the direction of the Madras High Court on payment of IDA to the workers. IDA has not been paid to workers for the last two years, he said.\n\nThe workers also demanded the government to take steps for revival of the mill that remains closed for over a year.\n\nThe government has extended the lay-off for another six months with effect from January 21 in A, B and C units (except spinning) due to non-payment of statutory dues and insufficient funds to settle all liabilities.\n\nAccording to a senior official, the total liability to be settled by the mill is Rs.166 crore.\n\nThe move to dispose of over 55 acres belonging to the mill in Puducherry and neighbouring Tamil Nadu by way of public auction would only procure Rs. 80 crore which will be insufficient to settle all the dues.",
