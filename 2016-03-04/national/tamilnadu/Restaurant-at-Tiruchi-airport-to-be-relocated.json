    "text": "To cater to the needs of the passengers and visitors, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) corporate headquarters has approved a proposal to convert the lounge on the ground floor at the Tiruchi international airport into a restaurant.\n\nConsequently, the old restaurant which used to function on the first floor of the airport would be re-located to the ground floor.\n\nThe old restaurant, which was located on the first floor of the airport, was closed because passengers found it difficult to reach the place.\n\nThe re-located restaurant and bar would be run by hotels of repute with the AAI in the process of inviting tender for this purpose. The new location would be easy to reach for passengers and visitors.\n\nA release from the Tiruchi international airport here said any agency interested in running the facility could approach the authorities. The release said the AAI had been trying to get an agency to run the executive lounge for more than a year. There has been no response to the proposal.\n\nA new area has been earmarked on the first floor before the security-hold area for the executive lounge to cater for any future requirement, a release added.",
