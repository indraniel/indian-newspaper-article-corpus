    "text": "Surgeons of the Srirangam Government Hospital have performed a \u201cdifficult surgery\u201d on a nine-month old baby with congenital dysplasia of the right hip.\n\nThe baby, Priyadarshini, daughter of Karuppusamy and Lavanya of Kalmettu Street of Veereswaram in Srirangam, suffered from congenital deformation of the right hip-joint.\n\nThe deformation was corrected through a surgery by a team of doctors, including John Viswanath, orthopaedic surgeon, and Anbu Chezhian, anaesthesiologist.\n\nExplaining the procedure, Dr. Viswanath told The Hindu that the surgery involved creating a cavity of the hip-joint socket and bringing the baby\u2019s developing femur bone head in place.\n\nThe baby has been put in hip spica, a type of plaster that covers both legs from the ankles up to the belly.\n\nDue to the deformity, the baby\u2019s mobility was affected. Following the surgery, the bones would develop within six to eight weeks and she would be able to walk soon, he said. The parents had taken the baby to several hospitals before coming to the Srirangam Government Hospital where the surgery was performed under the Chief Minister\u2019s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme.\n\nSuch a surgery is normally performed only at super speciality hospitals as it involves many risks, including administration of anaesthesia to the infant, Dr. Viswanath said.\n\nDr. Viswanath and his team recently performed a marathon surgery that lasted six hours on a person who sustained pelvic and multiple hip fracture after a fall from the third floor of a building.\n\nThe patient, Rajaboopathi, is able to walk after undergoing the procedure known as proximal femoral nailing, Dr.Viswanath added.",
