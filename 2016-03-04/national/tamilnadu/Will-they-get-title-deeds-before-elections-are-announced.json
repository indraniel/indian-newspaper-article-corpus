    "text": "Though it is now certain that they are bound to receive title deeds, tribal people in forest settlements in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve are not sure about getting the documents before elections.\n\nThere is apparently less clarity on when the title deeds will be given.\n\nAccording to P.L. Sundaram, MLA, the government departments must go ahead with the issuance of title deeds on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s clearance last month of the interim order of Madras High Court staying the deeds under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (in short, FRA).\n\nThe Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs had moved the Supreme Court praying for implementation of the FRA in Tamil Nadu, as elsewhere in the country.\n\nOnly in Erode district, the entire formalities for issuing title deeds to the forest dwellers have been completed, Mr. Sundaram said.\n\nBased on a survey of families that had been tilling forest land in nine settlements for three generations (75 years), the Forest Department had processed 411 applications for individual and group deeds and completed measurements for 337.8 hectares, he said.\n\nThe titles will be helpful for the tribal farmers to avail themselves of loan and subsidy benefits accruing from government schemes.\n\nThe FRA grants individual rights to cultivated land in forest area and community rights over common property resources, integrating conservation and livelihood rights of the people.\n\nThe grant of title deeds must be preceded by establishment of gram sabhas, constitution of Forest Rights Committees, and determination of Community Forest Resources rights by the gram Sabhas.",
