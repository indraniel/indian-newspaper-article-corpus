According to J. James, president of the association, one such awareness meeting was held here recently for about 80 micro unit owners.\n\nThe association has 18 divisions in the district and such meetings will be held in all the divisions. There will be programmes for the workers also.\n\nMost of the micro units operate in small sheds on rented premises.\n\nThe units have been seeking separate industrial estates in Coimbatore for the micro sector. Though the units mostly have workers with experience, there are instances of accidents.\n\nThe industry needs to ensure that there are no accidents in the existing premises too.\n\nThe objective is to take necessary steps so that that there are no accidents in these units.",
