Kirubakaran passed the order on an appeal moved by the Principal Secretary of Tamil Nadu Commercial Taxes Department assailing the order of a single judge dated February 5.\n\nAlleging that the State government had \u201cmechanically\u201d accepted the recommendations of the Viewing Committee which decided that the film title Gethu is not a Tamil word and thereby denied entertainment tax exemption to the film, the producer, Red Gaint Movies, approached the High Court sought quashing of the order.
