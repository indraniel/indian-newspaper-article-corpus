The tunnelling and track work got over several months ago. So, we want to check if everything goes well with electrification in this stretch now and carry out trials too,\u201d an official said.\n\nChennai Metro Rail plans to open to the public the first underground stretch between Thirumangalam ramp and Nehru Park by October of this year.",
