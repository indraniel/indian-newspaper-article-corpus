A single industrialist has been extended waiver but the Union Territory, having more than 12 lakh people, has been left in the lurch,\u201d said Mr. Viswanathan.\n\nPWF plans protest\n\nThe PWF would hold a demonstration near the head post office here on Saturday to condemn the booking of sedition cases against the CPI, CPI (M) leaders, AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal among other Opposition leaders in connection with Jawaharlal Nehru University incident.\n\nThe PWF would also hold a demonstration on March 7 to criticise the Puducherry government for its \u201cvarious failures\u201d in Villianur.\n\nMr. Viswanathan also said the parties in the PWF have started seat-sharing talks.",
