Yuvaraj and 16 others in Namakkal on Thursday.\n\nThe accused, of whom seven were detained under Goondas Act, and are out on bail appeared before the CJM S. Malarmathy, who ordered copies of the charge sheet to be served on them.\n\nThe Magistrate said that since the case was registered under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the trial would be transferred to the Principal District Judge court and directed all accused to appear before the PDJ on March 17.\n\nYuvaraj, a detainee under the Goondas Act, was brought from Vellore Central Prison amid tight security. Cadres of the Dheeran Chinnamalai Gounder Peravai raised slogans hailing Yuvaraj while he was taken in a police vehicle after the court proceedings.\n\nHe was later produced before a court in Perundurai in Erode where he is facing charges of abduction. Six others who were detained under the Goondas Act were later lodged at Salem Central Prison. Yuvaraj\u2019s wife Suveethan and over 75 supporters of the Peravai were present.",
