Security guards must be directed to park themselves inside the ATM.\n\nDespite various measures by banks, several ATMs in and around the city continue to be low on security. Some have security guards. However, many of these guards are advanced in years are often not equal to the task of guarding ATMs.\n\nShibu Isaac, managing director of Force 1 Guarding Services, said banks opted for tendering process and recruited security guards based on the lowest bidder. \u201cBut, we ensure more youngsters are trained to handle attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nResidents also demand that ATMs be located in a well-illuminated location and police patrolling must be intensified in such sites.\n\n(Reporting by Vivek Narayanan, K.Lakshmi and T.Madhavan)",
