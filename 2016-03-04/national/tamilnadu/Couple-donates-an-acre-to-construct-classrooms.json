Pudupalayam in Elandakuttai Panchayat in Pallipalayam here on Thursday.\n\nThe school was upgraded in 2011. At present, 700 students are pursuing their studies in the school.\n\nDue to lack of space, additional classrooms could not be constructed and students used to take classes sitting under trees.\n\nC. Sugumar, and wife S. Mala decided to donate land so that classrooms could be constructed for the school. At a function held on Thursday, the couple handed over the documents to the Minister for Industries and Transport P. Thangamani.\n\nDistrict Revenue Officer K. Palanisamy was present. The school headmaster said that additional classrooms at a cost of Rs. 1.58 crore would be soon. Likewise, S.
