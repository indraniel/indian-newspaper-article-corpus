According to police, the appraiser, Neelakanthan, 50, had asked his brother Ganesan and a relative Jayabalan to approach Repco bank for a loan and pledge fake jewellery. The bank asked Neelakanthan to appraise the jewellery, who in turn told the bank the jewellery was genuine, and a loan of Rs. 36 lakh was given to the duo. However, the bank later discovered that the gold was fake, and filed a complaint with the Central Crime Branch. \u2014staff reporter",
