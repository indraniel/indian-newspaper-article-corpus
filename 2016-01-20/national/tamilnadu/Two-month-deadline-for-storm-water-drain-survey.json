Koliwad-led joint legislature committee on lake encroachments came down heavily on revenue officials for not conducting a survey of Storm Water Drains (SWD) in the core city. It set a deadline of two months for completion of the survey.\n\n\u201cSWD survey in the city is crucial as these channels are also crucial for the restoration of lakes. While SWD survey in outer zones has achieved significant progress, it is almost a non-starter in the core city,\u201d Mr. Koliwad said.\n\nThe committee on Monday came down heavily on tehsildars for the slow progress in issuing notices to encroachers. It had set a January 30, 2016 deadline for issue of notices. However, following a review on Monday, the deadline was extended to February 15 and the alleged encroachers must submit their replies by February 29.\n\nThe committee made it clear that even government agencies, like BDA, BBMP, Transport Department, Urban Development Department, which have been named as encroachers in the report, should also be served show cause notices.\n\nThe committee will examine all the replies and decide on individual cases from March 1, 2016. This process is expected to take over two months after which the committee will submit its final report. Officials were directed not to take up clearing of any encroachments until the final report is submitted since the State government would be taking a call on the future course of action.\n\nEncroachment: 10,472 acres\n\nMarket value: Rs. 1.5 lakh crore\n\nEncroachers: 11,595 firms and individuals\n\n* Source: Status report of Joint Legislature Committee on Lake Encroachments released on January 9, 2016",
