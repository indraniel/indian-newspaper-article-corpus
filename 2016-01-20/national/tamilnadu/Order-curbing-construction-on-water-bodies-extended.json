    "text": "Extending an interim order directing the State government authorities not to permit any construction on water bodies in the entire State till February 9, the Madras High Court has ordered all District collectors to file an exhaustive affidavit indicating that no construction is permitted on them. A Division Bench of Justice Satish K. Agnihotri and Justice P. Devadass passed the directions on a petition moved by Iyarkai Valam Matrum Perumballa Odai Padukappu Nala Sangaman \u2013 an Erode-based organisation working against pollution and encroachment of water bodies. Noting that a stream was not only a source of irrigation for agricultural lands, but also a carrier in case of flood, the petitioner alleged that such a stream in Kathirampatti Village, Erode district has been encroached by illegal constructions. On December 17, when the plea came up for hearing, the court passed an interim order restraining authorities from permitting construction on water bodies till January 18.\n\nWhen the petition came up for hearing on Monday, the court was informed that the Erode District Collector has already filed a report .\n\nRecording the submission, the Bench sought an affidavit indicating that no construction is permitted on the water bodies from all the district collectors. The judges then appointed advocate Sriram Panchu as amicus curiae and posted the matter to February 9 for further hearing.",
