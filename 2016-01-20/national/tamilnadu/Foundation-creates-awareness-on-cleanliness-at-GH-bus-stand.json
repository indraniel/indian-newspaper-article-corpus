Chinnasamy and Secretary S. Ganesan, the students fanned out in eight teams to the various wards to sensitise the patients, hospital staff and visitors to the ways of disposing of solid wastes such as tea cups, old clothes and medicine bottles.\n\nPamphlets distributed\n\nThe students emphasised on the importance of disposing the wastes in the bins provided for the purpose. They also distributed pamphlets in the hospital as well as the Bus Stand where the cooperation of shopkeepers was solicited.\n\nThe students had found that the shopkeepers had a tendency to shift the onus of maintaining cleanliness on the pavements on to passengers.\n\nHowever, there were many who gave a patient listening to the requests of students, B. Chandrasekaran, Chief Executive Officer of OEF, said.\n\nThe Foundation, he said, would shortly be imparting training in cleanliness to the staff of the private outsourcing company involved in housekeeping in the Government Headquarters Hospital, he said.",
