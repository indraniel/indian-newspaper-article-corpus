    "text": "The Madras High Court has directed the appearance of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Department on February 4, for providing incomplete information to the court.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana gave the direction while hearing a public interest litigation petition moved by \u2018Elephant\u2019 G. Rajendran seeking to appoint a monitoring committee to audit the arrangements of Mahamaham festival at Kumbakonam.\n\nAt a recent hearing, the court observed that it is a matter of great concern that rampant unauthorised construction has been permitted right under the eyes of the authorities in Kumbakonam, where the Mahamaham festival is scheduled to take place.\n\nUnless the officers responsible are made to pay for their negligence and collusion, the situation cannot improve.\n\nWhen the PIL came up for hearing, the Bench pointed out an order passed by the Housing Secretary Dharmendra Prathap Yadav de-sealing an illegally constructed building. But the officer has mentioned in his affidavit that the particular building was also sealed during the action taken to check illegal construction in the area.\n\nPointing out the incomplete information in the affidavit, the court directed the officer to be present in the court during the next hearing to tender an explanation.\n\n\u2018File better affidavit\u2019\n\nNoting that the action taken against erring officials were not incorporated in the affidavit, the Bench directed the authorities to file a better affidavit within three weeks specifying the details of the action taken.\n\nThe Bench then posted the matter to February 4, for further hearing.",
