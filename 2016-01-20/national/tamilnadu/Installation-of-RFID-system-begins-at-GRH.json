    "text": "Installation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging system to prevent theft of babies began at Government Rajaji Hospital here on Monday by a team from Anna University along with third-party vendors.\n\nThe RFID system, generally used in supermarkets and malls to catch shop lifters, was suggested by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in September 2015 during the hearing of a baby theft case.\n\nThe project, presently carried out as a pilot at the GRH, will be replicated across all government hospitals by the government depending on its success. Sources at the GRH said that while some private players came with a proposal to implement the system with an initial cost as high as Rs. 3 crore, Anna University had proposed to do it with an initial cost of around Rs. 23 lakh.\n\nThe university team had completed its feasibility study and the installation work was expected to take three weeks.\n\nAccording to sources, the RFID system to be installed at the GRH will be an \u2018active\u2019 type system instead of the \u2018passive\u2019 type systems generally used in supermarkets, where detectors installed at the exit will beep if a material with RFID tag connected is taken through.\n\nThe \u2018active\u2019 type system to be installed at the GRH will have tags connected to every baby, its mother, and an attender from the family, apart from authorised nurses and doctors.\n\nThe system will raise an alarm if the baby is taken away beyond a fixed distance from the mother, attender or the hospital staff.\n\nDean M.R. Vairamuthu Raju said that there were specific challenges in the implementation as the hospital had a sprawling maternity award covering two floors, with at least 300 newborns at any time.",
