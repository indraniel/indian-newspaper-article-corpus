    "text": "The Karnataka government asks whether the bare fact that it was neither considered nor ignored as the \u201csole prosecuting agency\u201d in the corruption case would not by itself vitiate the High Court judgment.\n\nThe State wants the Supreme Court to address what would be the effect of not repairing this omission throughout the appeal hearings in the High Court till they were disposed of.\n\nThe Karnataka government\u2019s document, filed by advocate Joseph Aristotle and settled by senior advocate B.V. Acharya, asks whether the appeals were not vitiated as the duly appointed Public Prosecutor was \u201cnever given the opportunity\u201d of an oral hearing. His role was reduced to just handing over written submission, that too on the orders of the Supreme Court, at the fag end of the appeals in the High Court.\n\nIt pointed out that the acquittal can be set aside by just correcting the \u201ctotalling mistake\u201d to show that the value of disproportionate assets of the accused comes to Rs. 16.32 crore, that is 76.7 percent higher than the income, against the 8.12 percent arrived at by the High Court.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the judgment of acquittal is liable to be converted into one of conviction even as per the purported principle in Krishnanand Agnihotri's case,\u201d the State government contended.\n\nA Bench of Justices P.C. Ghose and Amitava Roy have scheduled the hearing on the appeals to start from February 2.",
