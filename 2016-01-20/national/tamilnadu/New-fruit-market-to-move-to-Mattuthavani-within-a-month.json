James\n\nThere is some good news for road users in the city as the wholesale and retail fruit markets in Simakkal, Yanaikal and East Marret Street will be shifted to a spacious complex near Mattuthavani integrated bus stand within a month.\n\nThe Corporation of Madurai held several rounds of talks with the office-bearers of fruit vendors\u2019 associations and arrived at a consensus a year ago. Based on the memorandum of understanding, the corporation would provide land, construct building (shops) and ensure basic amenities such as underground drainage, drinking water, storm water drain facilities.\n\nAs per the arrangement, the corporation will build 240 shops on 4.86 acres in three phases at a cost of Rs.16 crore. For their part, the fruit vendors will contribute Rs.11 crore towards the project.\n\nCorporation officials said that shifting of the fruit market from the existing locations in and around Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple would ease traffic congestion in the city.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa, Corporation Commissioner C. Kathiravan and senior officers visited the site and inspected the work in progress.\n\nIn all probabilities, the new fruit market complex would become functional in about a month, officials said.",
