If rupee continues to slide, it can upset the costing of end products as garment orders usually take few months to execute,\u201d said S. Dhananjayan, a trade consultant and chartered accountant.\n\nThe new steep cut in the valuation of yuan will give a further impetus to the garment exports from China as more and more buyers would source the products from there since it could become cheaper.\n\nAlready, China is the leading exporter of textiles and clothing in the world.\n\nExporters here feel that since currency markets could not be controlled, the Union Government should try to help out the exporters by extending export incentives to arrest any further widening of the trade deficit and help them remain competitive.\n\n\u201cRates of duty drawback and interest subvention can be increased and more sops be given to increase exports to focus markets so as to enable exporters here to increase the market share,\u201d said Raja Shanmugam, an apparel exporter and state committee member of Confederation of Indian Industry.",
