The organisations had also celebrated the United Nations declared-International Day of Happiness on March 20 last year.\n\nYamouna David of the Paris Bar Association and Executive Vice-President of OIB said that the workshop was attended by 50 people from across sections of society, and participants discussed how such a questionnaire could be worked out. They discussed about the relevance of questions in the Bhutanese Gross National Happiness survey, like \u2018why won\u2019t you vote in the next election?\u2019 and \u2018Do you feel responsible for conserving the natural environment?\u2019 Participants suggested that the questionnaire for the pilot project in Puducherry must include the impact of new technologies, pollution and areas like Smart Cities and robotics. They discussed what forms the basis of societal happiness and areas where improvement was due like infrastructure, ecological balance, security inside schools and care for the elderly. Ms. Yamouna expressed hope that such a pilot project could indeed be carried out in Puducherry.\n\nWorkshop conducted to present tangible propositions on societal happiness",
