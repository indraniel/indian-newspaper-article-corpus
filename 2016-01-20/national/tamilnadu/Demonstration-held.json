Senthil Kumar said that R. Naresh Kumar was appointed by the Project Director of the DRDA here about two-and-a-half-years ago for carrying out solid waste management works. He allegedly ill-treated department staff and officers working at panchayats, block development office and the district Collectorate.\n\n\u201cHe even threatened to get us sacked and was rude to us when we tried to intervene,\u201d Mr. Senthil said and added that the staff and officials resumed work from afternoon on Tuesday after the district administration told them that steps have been taken to initiate appropriate action against the officer concerned.",
