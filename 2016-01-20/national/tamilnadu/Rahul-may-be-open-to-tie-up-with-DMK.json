    "text": "For long, it was believed that Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi might turn out to be the biggest hurdle to the formation of an alliance between the party and the DMK in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHowever, TNCC sources indicated this seems to have changed following the Bihar elections. Congress sources confirmed that Mr. Gandhi told reporters at an informal meeting in Mumbai last week that he would go with the sentiments of the party\u2019s State units in formation of alliances.\n\n\u201cHe told the journalists that even if he had a differing opinion, the sentiment of the State unit would be taken into account and be respected since it was the State leaders who were answerable to the people directly,\u201d the source added. This shift in opinion is seen as a major development, since Mr. Gandhi had, in internal party discussions, expressed displeasure about the DMK after the manner in which it left the UPA a year before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nOpen invitation\n\nA senior leader said when DMK president M. Karunanidhi put out an open invitation to the Congress last month, a report was immediately sent to Mr. Gandhi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. \u201cIt has been clearly indicated to the leadership that DMK was the only option that could help us win seats,\u201d the leader said.\n\nCurrently, the Congress finds itself on a sticky wicket with both the AIADMK and the People\u2019s Welfare Front unwilling to accommodate it into their alliance.",
