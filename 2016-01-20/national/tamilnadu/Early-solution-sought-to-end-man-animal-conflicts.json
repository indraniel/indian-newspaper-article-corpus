    "text": "Forest Dept. presses kumkis into service to chase away wild elephants\n\nIt was a day of high drama at Pandalur near Gudalur in The Nilgiris on Tuesday as shopkeepers downed shutters and some of them, led by DMK MLA Dravidamani, observed a fast while another group of people resorted to picketing demanding an early solution to man-animal conflicts in the region.\n\nOn January 14, an elephant trampled to death a resident, Aneesh Abraham. This triggered protests and the police registered cases against the protesters. On Tuesday, the protesters demanded withdrawal of the cases and sought a lasting solution to the straying of elephants into human habitats in Gudalur and Pandalur taluks.\n\nThe Forest Department used two kumki from Mudumalai elephant camp to drive the herd back into deep forests and to prevent their frequent depredation into human habitations.\n\nForest officials said that the herd comprised two males, four females and a calf. One of the male elephants was said to be in a state of musth. The operation on Tuesday did not yield the result because of the traffic on Tamil Nadu \u2013 Kerala \u2013 Karnataka inter-State road, the officials said.\n\nThey said that the herd should be first chased across the road and from there to the forests of Kerala.\n\nThe chasing operation will continue on Wednesday.",
