    "text": "Irate residents and people of the villages staged a road roko blocking traffic at Vadakkal near here on Tuesday demanding that the authorities immediately repair the badly damaged stretch between Semmankudi and Thirukarukkavoor in Nagapattinam district. The people from Thirukarukkavoor and Keeranallur alleged that despite several pleas and reminders, officials had not renovated the damaged roads in the area. The areas were facing drinking water problems while many buses were skipping the region fearing the damaged roads.\n\nPolice and Revenue Department officials rushed to the spot, pacified the protesters, and assured them of swift action following which the protest was withdrawn.",
