    "text": "A major fire broke out on the second floor of Tallakulam Head Post Office here on Tuesday night. Fire and Rescue Services personnel, with the help of five fire tenders from Madurai and Tallakulam stations, fought the flames for more than an hour.\n\nA postal department employee said that the fire was first noticed around 8.30 p.m. The second floor housed the office of Senior Superintendent of Posts. It was mainly an administrative block where files of employees and officers were kept, he added.\n\nThe firemen struggled to reach the windows of tall building. Some 30 employees who were working in the office had left around 6 p.m.\n\nAn electrical short-circuit was suspected to have caused the fire. Initial probe indicated that the fire had destroyed some computers and furniture kept in two rooms on the second floor.",
