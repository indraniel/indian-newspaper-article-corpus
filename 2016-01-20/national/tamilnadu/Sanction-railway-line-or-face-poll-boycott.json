Though the project was conceptualised many decades back, a mere Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned in the Railway Budget of 2005. A total of Rs. 82 crore been sanctioned in the last 11 years against the then estimate of Rs 600 crore,\u201d said N. Kulanthaisamy, president of the committee.Even surveys were not carried out, or works on land acquisition has begun. If the project gets delayed further, the expenditure will shoot up.",
