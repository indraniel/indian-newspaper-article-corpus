    "text": "The district has received a grant of Rs. 8.72 crore to be given to farmers for nourishing horticultural and agricultural crops through micro irrigation systems on over 1,200 hectares.\n\nTo encourage the farmers to go in for micro irrigation systems that save huge quantity of water while increasing the yield substantially, the State Government gives 100 cent subsidy for small and marginal farmers, having 2.50 acres of wetland or 5 acres of land with some irrigation facility while other farmers get 75 per cent grant. Agriculturists having open wells or deep borewells in their farms or in the land taken on lease for a period of 10 years can avail this assistance.\n\nAspiring farmers should submit computerised patta of the land, certificate given by the village administrative officer on the crop cultivated on the land, topographic sketch, address proof and three passport size photographs to avail the assistance. Small and marginal farmers should also submit the certificate issued by the tahsildar authorising them as \u2018small farmers.\u2019\n\n\u201cSince the micro irrigation technique ensures 25 to 50 per cent increase in yield while requiring lesser quantity of water, farmers should go in for this technique with attractive subsidy,\u201d Collector M. Karunakaran said in a statement.",
