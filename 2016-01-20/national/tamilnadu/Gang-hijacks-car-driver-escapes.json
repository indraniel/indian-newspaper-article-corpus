Mohamed Ghouse (57) of Madurai.\n\nPolice said as the car reached Sanamangalam adjoining the Tiruchi \u2013 Chennai national highway, the gang are said to have asked the driver to stop the vehicle. They then placed a knife on the driver\u2019s throat and allegedly threatened him.\n\nThey took the car into the forest area abutting the national highway. The gang reportedly tied up the driver and pushed him out of the car and sped away in the hired vehicle.\n\nLater, the driver managed to untie himself and came on to the highway.
