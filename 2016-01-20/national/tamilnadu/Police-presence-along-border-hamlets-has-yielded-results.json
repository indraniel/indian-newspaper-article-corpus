    "text": "The Nilgiris and Coimbatore District Police said that increasing police presence in the hamlets bordering Tamil Nadu and Kerala has helped them gather intelligence inputs by getting closer to people. The police are confident that this will play a key role in curtailing attempts by Maoists from Kerala to enter Tamil Nadu.\n\nOf the 27 police stations in The Nilgiris, ten in Devala, Gudalur and Ooty Rural sub divisions are bordering Palakkad, Malappuram and Wayanad districts in Kerala where more than half a dozen attacks by Maoists have been reported from December 2014.\n\nTwenty police personnel (two from each of the ten stations) have been exclusively deployed to have a close interaction with the hamlets in their jurisdiction. These personnel are not assigned other police duties. In addition to gathering vital information on movement of people there, they have also become a bridge between the tribal hamlets and the district administration.\n\nThe personnel listen to the grievances of people in those areas and pass them to the Superintendent of Police of The Nilgiris and in turn to the Collector, who gets them redressed through the departments. The Collector has been convening a monthly all-department meeting exclusively to redress the grievances of people of these hamlets. \u201cIt has helped the police gain their confidence,\u201d said Murali Rambha, SP.\n\nCoimbatore\n\nA similar exercise is carried out by the police in Coimbatore district from early last year. Last month, the Coimbatore district police set up three new check-posts at Anaikatti (under Thudiyalur police station limit), Mulli (Pillur Dam police limit) and Pattisalai (Karamadai police station limit), close to the forest check-posts.\n\n\u201cA Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP) company has been deployed for manning the check posts in Periyanaickenpalayam sub division,\u201d said R.V. Ramya Bharathi, SP of Coimbatore district. At least, eight TSP personnel are stationed at these check-posts round the clock in shifts.\n\nDistrict police officers said that the northern part of the district covered in the above said areas were close to areas under Agali police station in Kerala where there was an attack by Maoists recently.",
