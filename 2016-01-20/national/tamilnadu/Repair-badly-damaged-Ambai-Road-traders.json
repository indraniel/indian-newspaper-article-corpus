Karunakaran here on Monday.\n\nThey were led by president of Melapalayam All Traders\u2019 Confederation A. Akbar Ali. In their petition, the traders said that the highway, popularly known as \u2018Ambai Road,\u2019 was in a worst shape for the past three months. Though hundreds of heavy vehicles, cars and two-wheelers traversed this stretch every day, no step had been taken to repair it.\n\n\u201cRoad repair work was started a few weeks ago but it was abandoned soon. Dust emanating from the road seriously affects the health of the public and business activities, especially sale of eatables. While two-wheeler riders mert with accidents every day, pedestrians are forced to walk on the edge owing to vehicles attempting to avoid the craters. Hence, the Collector should instruct the officials to repair the road as early as possible,\u201d Mr. Ali said.\n\nBus service\n\nA group of residents from Tamirapathi Colony of ward 26 submitted a petition seeking restoration of suspended town bus service to their area.\n\nThey said the suspended service \u2014route number 3T operated by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation between Tirunelveli Town and Tamirapathi Colony \u2014 had badly affected the public, especially the school children and senior citizens. The service must be restored immediately, they said.",
