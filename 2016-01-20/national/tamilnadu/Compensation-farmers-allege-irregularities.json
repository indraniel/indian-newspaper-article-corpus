    "text": "A group of farmers from various hamlets, near Gudimangalam in the district, petitioned District Collector G. Govindaraj on Monday alleging either non-payment of compensation or irregularities in identifying the beneficiary farmers while setting up overhead power transmission cable through the area.\n\nN. Periyasamy, one of the petitioners, said the setting up of 400 kv power transmission cables under way in places coming under the jurisdiction of Anikadvau power sub-station had resulted in displacement of crops like maize and banana in many places without even seeking permission of the respective farmers.\n\n\u201cIn few other places, the authorities have put markings on the coconut trees which need to be removed to facilitate the laying of cables without disbursing the compensation amount. In the case of coconut trees, the district administration has fixed compensation scales when erecting overhead cables,\u201d the farmers said.\n\nAgriculture department officials told The Hindu that the compensation amount fixed for coconut trees vary from a minimum of Rs. 11,500 for the trees aged between 1.5 years and 2 years, to a maximum of Rs. 18,860 for trees aged between 22 and 25 years.K. Srinivasan, a farmer from Ammapatti, complained that maize raised by him along the tract where the cable lines pass through, were mowed down. Farmers wanted compensation for the displaced crops other than coconut on area-basis.",
