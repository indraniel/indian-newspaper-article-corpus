Of these, 44,547 cases were registered from June. The number of cases registered for other traffic violations was 61,189. Of these, 53,008 cases were registered since June, after the helmet rule. The local police had adopted a carrot and stick approach towards its enforcement.\n\nBesides the penalty-based enforcement, the district police had resorted to a novel initiative of contests to engage the youth that constituted the majority of two-wheeler riders. Short film and selfie with helmet contests were conceived to bring on board the public in general and youth in particular.\n\nOn Tuesday, the police had invited the participation of school and college students by way of road safety exhibits in 20 stalls.\n\nOver 3,500 students participated, and the stalls highlighted various aspects of road safety, including hazards of drunken driving, and driving while talking on cell phones, said J. Loganathan, Superintendent of Police, Dharmapuri.\n\nOf the 9 short films received for the contest on wearing helmets, B.Ananthamurthy, of Akila Garden, Bagalur road, Krishnagiri, won the first prize, Tamizharasan, II year student of English, Don Bosco College, Dharmapuri, the second prize and P.Ramadoss, Chinnapuliampatty, Krishnagiri, won the third prize.\n\nSimilarly, for selfie with helmet contest, 12 entries were received and P.Nirosha of Periya Soragai, Mettur taluk, Salem, won the first prize, V.Dandapani, Elakyampatti, Dharmapuri, came second and S.Rajan of Senthil Nagar, Dharmapuri, got the third prize.\n\nHowever, participation to this extent was not expected. Hence, the contests may once again be opened up if more entries keep coming, the SP added.\n\nFilm actor Mayilsamy participated in the function at the special invite of the district police. IG \u2013West Zone C. Sridhar also took part. Winners of the drawing and painting competitions on road safety held last week were also felicitated.",
