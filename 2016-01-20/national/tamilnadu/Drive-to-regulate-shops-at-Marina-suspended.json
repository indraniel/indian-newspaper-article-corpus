    "text": "Chennai Corporation officials on Tuesday suspended work on regulating shops on the Marina beach after vendors threatened to stage an agitation.\n\nDuring Kaanum Pongal, hundreds of shops sprung up on the beach sands, covering areas beyond what had been earmarked for them last year.\n\nCorporation officials who tried to remove the shops were reportedly threatened by the vendors.\n\nAfter a few hours of protest, the officials decided not to carry out the drive. Visitors to the Marina beach on Kaanum Pongal had complained about reducing the space for recreation on the sands due to proliferation of illegal shops.\n\nAccording to Corporation officials, the number of shops on the Marina has been increasing at the rate of ten a month. Local political functionaries have been persuading people to take up hawking on the marina beach, collecting money from each vendor.\n\nIn June 2015, the Corporation shifted all shops on the Marina to five zones, restricting around 2,500 vendors to five rows along the stretch from Triumph of Labour Statue to Light House. A similar drive to shift the shops to create space for recreation on the sands is likely to be taken up only after the nod from the government. The HC had already directed the State to regulate the beach vendors.",
