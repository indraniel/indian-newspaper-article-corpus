They explained the various laws that protect the children in the society.\n\nAdolescent girls who work in textile sector face both physical and mental abuse, and hence they need to be prepared to come out of it. The sensitisation programme was held at many villages in the district and would continue in select villages in the coming days.\n\nS.L. Sathiya Nesan, Director, Leaf Society, elected members of the panchayat, and villagers participated in large numbers.",
