    "text": "Getting stopped by a traffic police man would usually leave a motorist in fear of being fined. But on Tuesday, a number of motorists were in for a surprise as they got roses and chocolates from the traffic personnel.\n\nAs part of the Road Safety Week celebrations, the traffic police embarked on an innovative method to create awareness on the importance of wearing helmets. They presented roses to motorists, who wore helmets, and those who did not, received chocolates near Anna Kalaiarangam junction on Anna Salai.\n\n\u201cWe presented the roses to motorists wearing helmets as a way of appreciating them in following the rules. We gave chocolates to those who did not wear helmets and asked them to certainly wear one from tomorrow. We told them the importance of wearing helmets to prevent head injury and saving lives,\u201d R. Seetharaman, Inspector, Traffic, said.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, the traffic police along with JCI stuck black stickers on the headlights of vehicles. \u201cThe glare from the headlights hinders vision of road users coming in the opposite direction at night hours. We stuck more than 1,000 black stickers on vehicles, including on buses, at the Green Circle junction and Makkan junction,\u201d he added.\n\nThe traffic police had also organised a free medical camp for drivers of autos, vans and buses at the New Bus Stand on Monday. The drivers underwent eye screening and were checked for their sugar levels to determine if they were diabetic, he said.",
