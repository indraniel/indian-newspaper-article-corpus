    "text": "Territorial hegemony and banned fishing mechanisms contrived to pit Adirampattinam fishermen against those from Karaikal resulting in the local people rounding up poachers just off the Thanjavur coast line over the past two days.\n\nOfficials were engaged in intense confabulations with both sides to resolve the potentially dangerous issue. Four boats and 27 fishermen from Karaikal are still held captive by the Adirampattinam fishermen and discussions are on to get them freed.\n\nThe issue of fishermen crossing homeland borders and poaching on even shallow coastlines to take advantage of big catch has been festering for more than a month in the region now.\n\nRevenue, police, and Department of Fisheries officials have been holding dialogues with the warring fishermen groups during the period to prevent the situation from getting out of control.",
