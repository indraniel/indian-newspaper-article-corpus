The oldest Siva Linga in the country is in Gudimallum near Tirupati. An old Sivalinga with inscription is in Mathura.\n\nArchaeologist R Nagaswamy said Netrumpakkam itself was very old and the presence of a granite stone belonging to the megalithic period confirmed its antiquity.\n\nAn idol of Durga worshipped as Ponniamman belonging to the Pallava period was unearthed, he said.\n\nThe lingam was found during renovation for the kumbabishekem (consecration) of a temple to be held in January 20. Panchayat president K. Prema Krishnamurthy immediately alerted the archaeologists.\n\nMr. Nagaswamy, who visited the temple on Monday, said the lingam with a square shaped Avudai had an inscription at the bottom reading CE N DA MAAN \u201cFive lotuses were drawn with the middle flower blooming,\u201d he said.\n\nT.G. Loganathan, epigraphist of the State Archaeology Department, said the word might be a name of a sculptor.\n\n\u201cMore research will throw light on the subject,\u201d said Mr. Loganathan who along with G. Arjunan, former deputy superintendent archaeologist of the Department, Loganathan decoded the inscription in the Lingam after visiting the Shiva temple.\n\nAs per archaeological records, the inscription at the Sri Kailasanathan temple on ECR belonged to 9{+t}{+h}century.\n\nThe inscription at Nandeshwar temple pushes the Tamil-Brahmi script in Tamil Nadu to a very early period. \u201cThe finding of the inscription is significant because it takes the origin of Tamil\u2013Brahmi script in Tamil Nadu several centuries earlier than it was believed so far,\u201d said K. Sridharan, former deputy director, Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department.\n\nArchaeologists had found Tamil\u2013Brahmi inscriptions on bedrocks near caves where Jain monks had settled. Some of the noted Jain settlements are Kongarpuliyankulam in Madurai, Arunkulam near Tirutani in Tiruvallur district, Onambakkam and Perumbakkam in Kancheepuram district.\n\nArchaeologists\n\nsay it could\n\nbe the\n\noldest lingam\n\nin State",
