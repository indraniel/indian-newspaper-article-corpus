    "text": "An autorickshaw driver on Tuesday handed over to the police a bag containing about 200 gm of gold jewellery, and Rs. 8,500 that fell from a car on to the road.\n\nThe bag belonged to an engineer hailing from Veerasamy Nagar Alankombu near Sirumugai.\n\nHe, along with his family members, was on way to Udhagamandalam in the car. The bag was kept on the carriage of the car.\n\nWhen the driver took a sharp turn, the bag fell on to the road.\n\nRangasamy (40) from Godepalayam near Bhavani Sagar, who was driving a car, picked up the bag and followed the car in vain.\n\nAs he could not stop the car, he handed over the bag to the Mettupalayam Police Station. The police contacted a phone number found in the bag.\n\nThe family members came to the station and collected the bag.\n\nThey expressed their gratitude to Rangasamy, and his friends who were in the car. The police too appreciated their honesty.",
