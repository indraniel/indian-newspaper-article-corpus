    "text": "Mushrooming of hatcheries across the country has led to increase in production of layer birds that led to increase in egg production. However, due to drop in wholesale price of eggs, most of the poultry owners face huge loss every year, R. Nallathambi, president, Tamil Nadu Egg Poultry Farmers Association said here on Sunday.\n\nAddressing the annual general body meeting, he said that poultry farming could only be carried out in the Kongu region and not in other parts of the State. In the past two years, a farmer who has one lakh birds suffered a loss of Rs. 50 lakh every year. This was due to intense competition prevailing among hatcheries which produced more birds than the required one, he added.\n\nMr. Nallathambi also said that hatcheries refused to hear the problems of poultry farmers and continued to produce more birds.\n\nFine\n\nHe said that a company was fined Rs. 10 lakh for vaccinating birds with fake medicine. \u201cOnly because cooperation is prevailing among us, we are able to initiate action against the company,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Nallathambi urged the Central Government to come forward in supplying rice, wheat, corn that were lying waste in Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at concessional price to the poultry farmers.\n\nAlso, interest rate for the industry should be reduced and should be on a par with the interest rate as given for agriculture, he added.\n\nNamakkal Revenue Divisional Officer M. Kannan was the special guest for the meeting.",
