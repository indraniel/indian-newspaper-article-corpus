    "text": ": Textile unit owners in Komarapalayam have urged the Central and the State Governments to provide them interest-free loans for establishing the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) at Pallakapalayam. The loan amount was to cover the owner\u2019s share of 25 per cent for establishing CETP.\n\nThere are over 200 processing unit owners who have formed the Komarapalayam Green Cauvery General Textile park cluster. They have identified 60 acre land in the area for establishing the park with zero liquid discharge at a cost of Rs. 168 crore. At a meeting held here recently, members said that the owner\u2019s share of 25 per cent for establishing CETP could not be borne by them as they were already facing huge loss and also most of the units are small. They urged the government to provide interest-free loan on long term basis. Establishing the park with common effluent treatment plan was the only way for continuous functioning of their units which are facing closure due to effluent discharge.",
