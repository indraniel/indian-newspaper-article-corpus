But, a Supreme Court order has made his life better.\n\nHe is likely to be granted honorary commission with monetary benefits, since the day he was granted the honorary rank is now being calculated as being in service.\n\nSubedar Major Kukkula Siva Reddy, who had put in 31 years of service in the Army, was discharged eight months short of his scheduled superannuation on September 30, 2008 due to health reasons. The Army veteran was, however, made an Honorary Lieutenant in August that year, which was more of a decoration and does not entitle him for monetary benefits, since he got it after retirement.\n\nLady luck smiled on him, as the Army, in the light of a Supreme Court judgment in a different case, had in December that year asked him whether was willing to rejoin service for all consequential benefits from the date of discharge to the date of rejoining.\n\nHe expressed his willingness and was deemed to have notionally rejoined duty between February 1 and September 30 that year.\n\nSince the Honorary Lieutenant rank was given to him on August 15, 2008, the ex-serviceman sought for honorary commission which would entitle him for monetary benefits.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his requests by the Army, he moved the Regional Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal in Chennai.",
