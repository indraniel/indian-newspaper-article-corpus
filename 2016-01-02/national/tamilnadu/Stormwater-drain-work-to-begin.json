Over 20 per cent of the roads are likely to get new precast drains, reducing the time required for closing roads for traffic, officials said.\n\nReady in two years\n\nThe project is expected to be completed in two years. Many of the roads identified for the drain project have already been damaged in the floods.\n\nOfficials will relay the roads only after construction of drains in many stretches.\n\nThe drains have been designed to transport water the city receives up to 6.8 centimetres per hour.\n\nChanges in drain design are not likely to be made due to the floods. The maximum width of the stormwater drains will continue to be three feet.",
