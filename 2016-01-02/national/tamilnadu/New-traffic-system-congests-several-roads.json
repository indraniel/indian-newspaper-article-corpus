    "text": "Effort taken by the police to decongest Brookebond Road from Monday by implementing a one-way traffic system has affected nearby roads.\n\nFrom Monday, Brookebond Road was closed for traffic from the Avinashi Road Flyover to Chinthamani Junction.\n\nThese vehicles were diverted through Mill Road and Flower Market to Chinthamani Junction. But narrow roads and stray parking of vehicles congested this route and made motorists waste more time on the road.\n\nFollowing mounting inconveniences, the police have carried out more than 10 measures to decongest the roads connecting Oppanakara Street, Mill Road and Flower Market. This included creating more space for vehicles on Flower Market to Chinthamani Junction by moving barricades from the middle of the road.\n\nA traffic police officer said that they were trying to implement a few more changes to decongest the roads connecting Brookebond Road, Flower Market, and Mill Road.",
