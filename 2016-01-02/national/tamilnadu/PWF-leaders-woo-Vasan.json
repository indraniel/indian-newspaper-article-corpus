    "text": "In a bid to expand the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF), its leaders met the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) president G.K. Vasan on Friday and invited him to join the alliance and take on the two principal Dravidian parties in this year\u2019s Assembly elections.\n\nThe PWF, which comprises the MDMK, VCK and the two Left parties, has already approached DMDK founder Vijayakant to persuade him to join their front.\n\nIncidentally, the PWF\u2019s efforts to rope in the TMC comes close on the heels of the DMK making it clear that it was not averse to rebuilding bridges with the Congress. By being open to an alliance with the Congress, the DMK has effectively shut the doors on the TMC, which is a breakaway outfit of the Congress. On Friday, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, CPI (M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan and VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan had a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Vasan at the TMC office in Teynampet.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Mr. Vasan told journalists the leaders explained to him why the TMC should join the PWF. \u201cI thanked them for their visit and the invite. I have informed them that I will consult my party leaders and cadres and get back,\u201d he said. Mr. Ramakrishnan said the \u201cgrowing resentment\u201d among the public against the two Dravidian parties was explained to Mr. Vasan. \u201cWe are hopeful he would make a favourable decision for the welfare of the people,\u201d he said.",
