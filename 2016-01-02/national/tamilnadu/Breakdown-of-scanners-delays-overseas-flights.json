The SHA is guarded by the CISF personnel.\n\nThe two scanners which were seven-years-old are exclusively meant to scan the hand luggage of the passengers before they board the aircraft. Every individual is frisked at the SHA as part of the pre-embarkation security check. The technical snag forced the CISF personnel to manually check the hand luggage of every passenger accommodated in the SHA, which was modified a few months ago.\n\nThe manual checks which had to be mandatorily carried out due to the malfunctioning of the scanners led to time delay posing immense hardship to passengers who checked in early.",
