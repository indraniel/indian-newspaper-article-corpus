    "text": "A youth hailing from Odisha, suspected to be mentally deranged, was on Friday picked up by the Panagudi police here after he was wandering in a secluded place situated about 3 km from the ISRO\u2019s Propulsion Research Centre (IPRC), Mahendragiri, a high security complex.\n\nLast month some locals had spread a rumour about a glider flew over the IPRC and landed in a nearby forest prompting the police to conduct a massive search operation in the jungle of the Western Ghats close to the high security premises but in vain. Against this backdrop, police received information about the movement of a man at Kannimar Odai near Panagudi on Friday and detained him.\n\n\u201cHe responded incoherently in Odiya to our questions. He appeared to be mentally ill and we\u2019re trying to establish his identity,\u201d said a police officer.",
