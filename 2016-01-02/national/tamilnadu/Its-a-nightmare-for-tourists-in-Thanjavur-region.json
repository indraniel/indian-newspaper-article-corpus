The Karanthai stretch is awful and its condition has worsened after the recent rains. Potholes are too shallow a term to describe the pits that dot the road.\n\n\u201cThe stretch from TNSTC bus depot on the Vadavaru banks to the Jambu Cauvery culvert bridge is atrocious. It is difficult to navigate the buses through the stretch. If we have to stomach the scorn of passengers travelling by the bus, we also have to endure the hiding of our senior depot officials for the damages caused to the vehicle,\u201d says a TNSTC bus driver.\n\nOn the Nanjikkottai Road, the dust kicked up by the swaying heavy vehicles has left a thick film of red and brown on the fa\u00e7ade of the buildings.\n\nIn spite of fewer encroachments, wider road width and better planning of the entire stretch, official apathy is the derailing quotient here. Not just due to rains, even on normal days, the road has remained bad and neglected,\u201d sales professional S. Gopalakrishnan says.\n\nThe residents inhabiting the maze of lanes leading through the Mission Street, Maharnonbuchavadi, and Tolkappiar Square area are all tolerating bad roads as they step out of their houses.",
