    "text": "Power loom unit owners here have appealed to the State Government to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on cotton yarn to two per cent.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Government, M. Duraisamy, chairman of Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council, said States such as Maharashtra have two cent VAT on cotton yarn. The Central Sales Tax on the yarn is also two per cent. However, in Tamil Nadu, the VAT is five per cent on cotton yarn. Further, fabric is exempted from VAT here.\n\nWith the high VAT rate on cotton yarn, there is evasion of duty by several units. They bill the yarn as hank yarn or as fabric to avoid duty. Many units purchase yarn from other States. The powerloom units need to pay high price for yarn because of the five per cent VAT. Hence, the Government should reduce the VAT on yarn to two per cent and if needed, levy one per cent VAT on fabric, he said.\n\nMr. Duraisamy told The Hindu that most of the fabric exports from this region are to the Latin American and African countries. The exports had declined because of withdrawal of some of the export incentives by the Central Government in April this year. The Union Government had restored the benefits recently. This is expected to revive fabric exports and there are indications of it, too.\n\nThe levy of one per cent VAT on fabrics by the State Government and reduction of the duty on yarn will bring down evasion and increase the revenue for the government, he said.",
