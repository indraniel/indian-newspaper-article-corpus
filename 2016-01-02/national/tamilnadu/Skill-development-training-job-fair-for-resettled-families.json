The mela will be held after Pongal.\n\nThe resettled residents will receive training in skill development for taking up jobs along the IT Corridor.\n\nA bio metric survey has been conducted for the residents and it has revealed that women head most of the families.\n\nWomen in each of the displaced family are likely to receive training in cooking, food preservation and storage.\n\nThe plan is to equip them with jobs that will make them earn at least Rs.10,000 a month.\n\nThe average monthly income is about Rs.8000. Most of the displaced residents are engaged in informal jobs and less than 10 per cent have regular earnings.\n\nMen from displaced families will receive free training in driving, plumbing, mechanical and electrical works, officials said, adding that plans to offer opportunities on entrepreneurship for the educated youth from displaced families are also likely to be implemented.",
