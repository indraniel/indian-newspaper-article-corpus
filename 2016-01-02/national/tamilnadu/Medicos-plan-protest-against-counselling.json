    "text": "A section of post-graduate students have planned to stage a dharna in front of the Directorate of Medical Education office on Tuesday against alleged lack of transparency in the ongoing counselling process.\n\nCounselling for post-graduate candidates began on December 29.\n\n\u201cRight from the beginning there are discrepancies. On the first day of counselling, the process was smooth, but suddenly the DME changed tack and even as service candidates were being placed, it was announced that counselling for diploma candidates would also be conducted,\u201d said one of the candidates.\n\n\u201cAs we were waiting for our turn we learnt that all the positions were filled with diploma students. This is against the Medical Council of India norms,\u201d the candidate added.\n\nSimilar complaint\n\nA similar complaint came from women candidates who had qualified as obstetricians and gynaecologists.\n\nConfusion has risen as the Health department has two methods of recruiting doctors.\n\nSome of them are directly appointed through Medical Recruitment Board, while others launch their career in primary health centres of taluk hospitals and work their way up to pursue higher education.\n\nAccording to R. Lakshmi Narasimhan, president of Service and Postgraduate Doctors Association, based on their suggestion current counselling had given preference to candidates who had put in many years of service in government hospitals and had completed PG degrees.\n\n\u201cThough candidates recruited by the MRB are also qualified doctors, they cannot be given priority over doctors who had served in government hospitals from the beginning. We pointed out that it was unfair to forget their service. By giving priority to these candidates we are ensuring that they will continue their service and the government would also retain a committed candidate,\u201d Dr. Lakshmi Narasimhan said.\n\nSimultaneous counselling\n\nAccording to DME officials the confusion was because the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) was conducting counselling simultaneously.\n\nThe DMS will offer placement for candidates with PG diploma qualifications and appoint them in hospitals that come under its purview. These doctors are not qualified to be teachers.\n\nConfusion has risen as the Health department has two methods of recruiting doctors",
