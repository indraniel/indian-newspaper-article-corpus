At the same time, the \u2018grace period\u2019 will not get extended beyond a week,\u201d a temple official said.\n\nNagercoil\n\nThe temples under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department in Kanyakumari district have started enforcing the dress code for devotees and visitors as per the directions of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court from Friday.\n\nMost of the temples in Kanyakumari district followed the Kerala pattern \u2013 men were prohibited from wearing shirts.\n\nUnaware of the court directions on dress code, many foreign tourists and tourists from northern states visited the temples as usual on Friday. They were frisked by the security personnel at the Bhagavathy Amman temple in Kanyakumari, Sthanumalayan temple in Suchindram and Adi Kesava Perumal temple at Thiruvattar and sent back.\n\nMany devotees who were sent back by the security personnel, visited the temple in Kanyakumari again in dhoti, said Siva Ramachandran, Executive Officer of Bhagavathy Amman temple. Banners on dress code to be followed by the devotees were kept in three places around the temple. The banners were printed in Tamil, English and Hindi, Mr. Ramachandran said.\n\nHowever, the directions were not strictly followed in a few temples, as the authorities were yet to create awareness among the devotees. Many girls and men, who visited Nagaraja Temple in Nagercoil with leggings and jeans, said no one objected to their entry into the temple.\n\nSoon after the High Court issued the orders, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department directed the temples under its control to enforce the rules pertaining to the attire of the devotees and visitors according to agamas, traditions and customs of the individual temples.\n\nJustice S. Vaidyanathan had ordered that from January 1 men should wear a \u201cdhoti or pyjama with upper cloth or formal pants and shirts\u201d to temples and women should wear \u201ca sari or a half sari or churidhar with upper cloth.\u201d Children could wear \u201cany fully covered dress.\u201d\n\nHowever, temples where men were prohibited from wearing an upper cloth could continue the practice, he clarified.\n\nDevotees not following dress code allowed with a warning that \u2018grace period\u2019 will not be extended beyond a week",
