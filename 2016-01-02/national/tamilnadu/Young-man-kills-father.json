After the death of his wife there, he had come to his village here, where he was running a small shop selling consumables and stationery items.\n\nTroubles started after his son Sendil Kumar, who is married and had his family in Tiruchi, came to know that Soundarapandi had sold a property in the village and thus demanded his share of money.\n\nOn Thursday night, both the father and son had a wordy altercation, which snowballed into a big fight in the early hours.\n\nAgitated, Sendil Kumar had broken a glass bottle to assault his father. With bleeding injuries around neck, when he collapsed on the floor, Sendil kumar had thrown a grinder stone in which the victim died on the spot.\n\nOn information, the Thirumangalam town police sent the body for post-mortem. Fearing arrest, Sendil Kumar escaped but was arrested.",
