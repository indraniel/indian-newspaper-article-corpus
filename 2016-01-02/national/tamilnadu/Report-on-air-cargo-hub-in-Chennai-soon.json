Section 80-IA of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, provides a 10-year tax holiday for infrastructure projects.\n\nThe recently-constituted Air Cargo Logistics Promotion Board (ACLPB), which aims at promoting growth in air cargo, is also expected to submit a detailed action plan to reduce dwell time of air cargo from \u2018aircraft to truck\u2019 to below 24 hours by December 31, 2016 and to six hours by December 31, 2017.\n\nThe cargo terminal at Chennai Airport established in February 1978 is spread over 19.5 acres with the annual handling capacity of 11,02,373 MT. It had handled 2,20,401 MT during 2013-14.",
