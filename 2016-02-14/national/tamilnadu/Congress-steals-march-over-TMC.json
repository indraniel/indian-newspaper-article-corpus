    "text": "Battle lines were drawn between the Congress and the Tamil Maanila Congress the moment former Union Minister G.K. Vasan split the former in November 2014. Saturday\u2019s firming up of an alliance with the DMK has given an edge to the Congress in this battle.\n\nLeaders in the Congress were elated after the party\u2019s isolation ended on Saturday. Though many restrained from openly commenting on the TMC, the fact that the DMK chose to invite the Congress and that the TMC is still unable to find an ally is being considered the first victory.\n\nHowever, the TMC put up a brave face. Party vice-president B.S. Gnanadesikan said the mere fact that the Congress has found an ally did not mean it was stronger than the TMC. \u201cThere are so many smaller outfits which would eventually join the DMK front. Does this mean they all have great strength,\u201d he asked.\n\nMr. Gnanadesikan said the TMC was in talks with potential allies. \u201cJust because we are not making it public does not mean we are not in talks. You will know very soon about these developments,\u201d he claimed, refusing to state with who the party was in talks.\n\nWithin the TMC, factions that wanted to hold hands with the DMK seem to be disappointed.\n\n\u201cAs long as the Congress has some strength, the TMC would find it difficult to expand. If the TMC had joined the DMK front, it would have isolated the Congress. Now, we hope we will have a stronger tie-up,\u201d a leader said on condition of anonymity.",
