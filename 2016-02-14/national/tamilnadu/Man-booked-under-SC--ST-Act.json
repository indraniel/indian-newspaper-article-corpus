    "text": "Police arrested one person from Paravai near Samayanallur under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act here on Friday.\n\nIn the complaint filed by M. Pandi (37), a Dalit residing at Sathyamurthi Nagar in Paravai, he has alleged that he and his wife P. Dhanalakshmi were verbally abused with casteist remarks by their neighbour M. Duraipandi, a caste Hindu.\n\nPolice sources said that Pandi and his wife, running a tea shop near their house, are regularly supplying tea to the staff members of a school located nearby. Pandi said the issue snowballed as Duraipandi discouraged the teachers from buying tea from his shop as he was a Dalit. He urged the staff to buy tea from any shop run by a caste Hindu. Hearing this through one of the staff members, Pandi confronted his neighbour a few days ago. In a quarrel, Duraipandi hurled casteist abuses at Pandi and his wife, he said in the complaint.\n\nThough a case was registered at Samayanallur police station, Duraipandi is yet to be arrested.",
