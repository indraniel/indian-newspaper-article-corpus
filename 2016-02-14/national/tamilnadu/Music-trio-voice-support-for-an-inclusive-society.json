The trio performed in the city on Saturday for \u2018Gurukripa 2016,\u2019 a fundraising concert for The Shakti Foundation.\n\nThe musicians said that the cause they were performing for \u2014 towards an inclusive society for people with disabilities and creating barrier-free public spaces \u2014 was something that was close to their heart. \u201cIn many other countries, barrier-free public spaces are just taken for granted because all the facilities needed for access such as ramps and pathways are already in place. Even if not shops, malls and theatres, we need to start from footpaths and pavements on the roads here for easy access,\u201d said Ehsaan Noorani.\n\nStating that the country was marching towards progress and change, Loy Medonsa said that more action was, however, needed for implementing measures for an inclusive environment.\n\nHaving performed for The Shakti Foundation before, the trio said that it had always been a fantastic experience to perform for children and see them smile.\n\n\u201cThere are so many stories of differently-abled children and adults having made it big. We want to ensure that more such successes are possible for many out there, which can be facilitated through a barrier-free environment and an inclusive community,\u201d said Vasanth Raghuvir, founder of The Shakti Foundation.\n\nThere are so many stories of differently-abled children and adults having made it big",
