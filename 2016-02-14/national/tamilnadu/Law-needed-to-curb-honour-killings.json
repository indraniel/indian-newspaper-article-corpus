Attending the meeting, Brinda Karat, Politburo member of the CPI(M) said that the governments of the day had proudly claimed both in the U.N. and in Parliament that there was not a single case of honour killing in the country. There was a law to register murder and rape, but none to account for murder in the name of honour. How can there be data, where there was no law? she asked. The struggle to bring in a legislation in respect of honour killing was not just a legal, social, and political battle, but also economic, since the poor were used as pawns in the caste politics unleashed in the name of caste purity, Ms. Karat said.\n\nReferring to Illavarasan and Divya she accused the PMK of running a campaign that cost the lives of Illavarasan, and Divya\u2019s father. The struggle was to break this cultural concept of women as repositories of community honour. U. Vasuki, All India vice-president, AIDWA, said that there had been a systemic erosion of women\u2019s rights with the proliferation of caste outfits. \u201cThese outfits now urge their community not to send girls for higher education, not to teach them computers, not to give them mobile phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone is murdered, a relative of the deceased would file a complaint. But in the case of an honour killing committed by the victim\u2019s immediate kin, who will file a complaint?\u201d she asked, stressing the urgency for a separate law.\n\nMs. Vasuki asked parents to teach their children to make an informed choice, and raise them as equals. Delhi Babu, MLA, said the Left representatives had raised the demand for a legislation and would put pressure on the government for the same.",
