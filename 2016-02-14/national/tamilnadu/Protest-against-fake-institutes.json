Thirumurugan, who led the agitation, alleged that the fake institutes were freely functioning in the district, fleecing poor students but the government authorities continued to turn a blind eye.\n\nTaking the poor students for a ride, these institutes charged exorbitant fees and continued to function unchecked, Kan Ilango, State general secretary, said.\n\nThey would step up the agitation if the district administration failed to take immediate action, district president C. Pasumalai said.",
