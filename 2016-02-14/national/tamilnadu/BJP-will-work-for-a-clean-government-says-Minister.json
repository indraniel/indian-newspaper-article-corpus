SRINATH\n\nSenior BJP leader and Union Minister of State for Surface Transport Pon. Radhakrishnan said the BJP would work for forming a corruption-free government in the State.\n\nInaugurating the 21{+s}{+t}State-level conference of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) here on Saturday, he said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had been providing clean administration to the people. No one could level corruption charges against any Minister. Similarly, the State should be ruled (by the BJP), he said.\n\nUnderlining the importance of youth power, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the ABVP had strengthened its roots in the State. There was a need to enrol as many members as possible into its fold. Moreover, it should work hard to create awareness among the people on programmes and policies of Narendra Modi government. It would lead to set a big goal.\n\nHe said the ABVP, which was working for the development of youths and students, should work for achieving the goal of inclusive education and quality education to all irrespective of poor or rich, caste, or community.\n\nS. Subbaiah Shanmugam, national vice president, M. Nagalingam, State president, G. Lakshmanan, national secretary, ABVP, and so on spoke.",
