It will identify the couples and inform the police and parents about their behaviour.\n\nWhile many three star hotels in Puducherry have planned for candlelight dinners and many events for this occasion, M.Siva, zonal in-charge, ABVP in Puducherry, has said: \u201cThe organisers encouraging the Valentine\u2019s Day are trying to destroy the type of culture and tradition of our country. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day is being celebrated to destroy India.\u201d\n\nHowever, V.J.Chandran, Senior Superintendent of Police (Crime and Intelligence) said adequate safety measures would be taken to prevent ABVP from disrupting the celebrations. \u201cThis is a democratic country and everyone has the right to celebrate. Nobody can disrupt peace. All measures would be taken to provide safety,\u201d he said.",
