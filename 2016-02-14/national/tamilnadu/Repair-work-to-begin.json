    "text": "Chennai Corporation is all set to restore bridges and subways damaged by floods in December.\n\nMost of the damaged structures have been identified along the Adyar river. Damages have been reported in the Aranganathan subway in Saidapet covering wards 140 and 171. Floodwaters had weakened some parts of the subway. Use of heavy machinery and intervention by various agencies in relief and rescue operations after the floods reportedly caused the damage to most of the structures. Jones Road subway in ward 142 in the same area has also been damaged during the floods. After the release of water from the Chembarambakkam lake, Alandur bridge across the Adyar river was damaged. Bazaar Road subway in ward 142 near the banks of the Adyar was also damaged.\n\nThe civic body has also planned to repair the Usman Road bridge and the Mahalingapuram bridge in wards 113 and 110. A bridge across Otteri Nullah connecting Konnur High Road, Strahans Road and Brick Kiln Road was damaged during rescue operations. The bids for the projects are expected to be finalised before the notification of elections.",
