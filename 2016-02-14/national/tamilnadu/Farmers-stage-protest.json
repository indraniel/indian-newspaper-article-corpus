Sivasamy, the farmers complained that boar, deer, peafowl apart from elephants entered fields to destroy crops. The Government should compensate those farmers who had lost their crops to the animals and gale.\n\nIn the past three months there had been several instances of elephants entering not only farms but also human habitations but the Government had done little to prevent their entry, the farmers charged and add that the only way they could solve the problem was to invade cities from villages as the animals entered farms, the press release added.\n\nFor, their action would draw the attention of the authorities concerned and force them to provide solution, the farmers said.",
