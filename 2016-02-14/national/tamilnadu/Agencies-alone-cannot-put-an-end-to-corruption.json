More such agencies would come up but they would hardly have an impact in bringing down corruption till people decide not to be corrupt.\n\nChief Vigilance Commissioner, Government of India, K.V. Chowdary said this at \u2018Santhosham 2016\u2019 the Rotary District Conference RI Dist 3201 in Coimbatore on Saturday. He stressed the need for Swachh Bharat like drive to remove corrupt practices from the society. \u201cIt is sad that people don\u2019t like to talk about corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to a recent study released by Berlin-based Transparency International, he said that India has been ranked at the 76{+t}{+h}place among 168 in its Corruption Perception Index \u2013 for the year 2015. \u201cThis is not a desirable position and we cannot afford to be corrupt. We have to start rooting out corruption starting from our home and office,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCorruption at the policy level is big but its impact reaches the common man later than street side corruptions that go unnoticed, but immediately affect them.\u201d He strongly felt that punishing the corrupt alone will not put an end to corruption.\n\nExpressing the need for awareness on corruption among all stakeholders, he said organisations like Rotary should organise anti-corruption campaigns. The drive should begin with throwing light on what is corruption. While accepting money or other monetary benefits are predominantly cited as corrupt practices, the CVC said that nepotism, fudging, helping someone based on caste and other grounds by affecting someone who deserved it more are among various forms of corruption.",
