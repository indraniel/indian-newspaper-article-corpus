Lakshmi narayanan\n\nThe steep fall in the price of various varieties of flowers has become a matter of concern for famers at Thevur. The farmers are waiting for prices to rise to harvest them.\n\nThe farmers of villages of Sozhagoundanur, Vatrampalayam, Kottayur, Thannidasanur, Poomaniyur, and Ponnampalayam have raised marigold (samanthi), kozhi kondai, poornima, chandini, kendhi, and vaadamalli in large tracts of land.\n\nThe water from Rivers Sarabanga and Cauvery, and wells was used to raise the flowers. During the Pongal, Sabarimalai and Thaipoosam seasons, there was a good demand for flowers. Farmers could fetch a good price too.\n\nThe flower traders from Bengaluru, Madurai, Coimbatore, and Tiruchi procured the flowers directly from the farmers. Taking advantage of the demand, the farmers continued to raise the flowers on their fields.\n\nThe price of all the flowers has suffered a fall in the last few days.\n\nSamanthipoo price has gone down to Rs. 100 a kg; chandini Rs. 100; poornima Rs. 110; and kozhikondai Rs. 70 a kg.\n\nDue to the poor price, there is also a drop in the arrival of traders for procuring the flowers. Following this, the farmers have stopped harvesting the flowers. Disappointed farmers say that the flowers have already started withering.\n\nThe local farmers believe that the forthcoming annual festival in Mariamman, Kaliamman, Omkaliamman temples in Thevur and its surrounding villages will lead to a demand for flowers again.\n\nWe are waiting with our fingers crossed pinning hopes on the temple festivals, they said.",
