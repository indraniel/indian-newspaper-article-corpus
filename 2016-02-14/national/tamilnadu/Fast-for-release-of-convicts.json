    "text": "Condemning the governments, various speakers demanded the immediate release of seven convicts figuring in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.\n\nObserving a day-long token fast at Obulapadithurai here, members from various Tamil movements and Muslim outfits urged the governments to be just in their decision. Serving punishment in prisons for over two decades since the assassination was reported could not be justified any more, they said.\n\nThe State government, which had resolved in the Legislative Assembly in February 2014 to release the convicts under the powers vested within itself, forwarded it to the Union government for its nod.\n\nConveniently, the Centre moved the apex court, which stayed the release by the Tamil Nadu government. Since then, the seven convicts continued to languish in the prisons, the members said.\n\nEven now, many noted jurists had opined that the convicts, who had served 25 years, shall be freed and the laws were clear. Considering them, the government should take a decision to release them.\n\nLikewise, the speakers challenged the detention of Muslims, under the guise of fundamentalists, behind bars for over 10 years.\n\nThe minorities were constantly victimised and humiliated by the police, they said.\n\nThe speakers included advocates Marudu, Kanagavel, Raju of Tamil Desiya Iyakkam, Nagai Tiruvalluvan of Tamil Puligal, Kadar Mohideen of Manitha Neya Katchi, Mujibu Rahman of SDPI among others.",
