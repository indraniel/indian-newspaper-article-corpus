This week, in Tiruchi, over 60 people responded to our announcement, even though we had expected only around 40,\u201d Dr. Ismail told The Hindu . \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see a commitment among the youth to preserve nature, and to work for the country\u2019s environment safety,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Friday, 67 children were introduced to basic life science through \u201cSimple Tasks, Great Concepts\u201d, featuring simple experiments using commonly available material. All the lessons are also available through apps on Dr. Ismail\u2019s website http://www.erfindia.org/\n\nDr. Ismail is credited with coining the term \u2018vermitech\u2019, the science of converting organic waste into useful manure using earthworms. His visual presentation demonstrated ways to expand home-bound operations for other establishments like hostels and industries.\n\nOn Saturday, over 60 city residents turned out for the day-long workshop on eco-friendly gardening and farming conducted by Dr. Ismail. In the interactive presentation, Dr. Ismail outlined several aspects of vermicomposting, and ways to find a commercial potential in recycling. Explaining soil nutrition, Dr. Ismail suggested gardeners and farmers alike should reconsider the pattern of fertilisation for better results, besides homemade tonics for plants. He spoke on ways to filter \u201cgrey water\u201d (generated in households) through plants, and warned against growing commercialisation of food production that had introduced chemicals into the dietary chain.\n\nIn the post-lunch session of the workshop, 40 vermicomposting starter kits were distributed among the delegates, who then assembled their first composting pit using the plastic bins, layering material and earthworms provided by the science centre.\n\nThis was followed by a demonstration by Dr. Ismail on formulating soil nutrition tonics and sprays using material from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cThe next step from here is to teach more people, as long as I live, as long as I breathe,\u201d said Dr. Ismail. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to see organisations utilising our work,\u201d he added.",
