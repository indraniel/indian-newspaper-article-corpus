Kumaravel, state secretary, Hindu Makkal Katchi, said instances of lovers kissing and embracing each other in public places had increased and it was destroying the social fabric of the society. \u201cWe will be burning photographs showing couples kissing and embracing each other. In the name of love, these youngsters are crossing the line,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLast year, we planned to bring the \u2018 thali \u2019 with an intention to get the couples married. But we were stopped by the police. Next year, we will surely make it happen.\u201d\n\nA TNTJ spokesperson echoed this sentiment: . \u201cWe will give out notices against this day. What these people are doing in the name of love is not love at all. It is about lust.\u201d A series of posters from the Muslim organisation claims that Valentine\u2019s Day was invented to \u201crape and destroy the chastity of women\u201d. Another one asks : \u201cDo we need a day to lose chastity?\u201d",
