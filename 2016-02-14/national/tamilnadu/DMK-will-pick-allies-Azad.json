    "text": "After his meeting with DMK leader M.Karunanidhi, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad expressed confidence in the alliance partner. In fact, he handed over the task of finding/accommodating other partners to the DMK.\n\n\u201cSince the Congress, the oldest political party in the country and the DMK, the oldest regional party have come together, there will be more political parties wanting to join. An alliance including the DMK, the Congress and other parties will make it formidable to defeat opposition parties,\u201d he said. He made light of the differences that led to the exit of the DMK from the Congress-led UPA after accusing it of letting down the Sri Lankan Tamils.\n\n\u201cSometimes in politics there are compulsions and pressures. But, by and large the DMK and the Congress have gone together, both in Assembly and Parliament elections,\u201d he said.",
