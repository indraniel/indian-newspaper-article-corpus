Rajan Chellappa, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, Corporation Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri, Dhan Foundation Managing Director M.P. Vasimalai, G. Vasudevan from Hotel Fortune Pandyan, Hi-tech Arai MD B.T. Bangera, \u2018Shree Sakti\u2019 Chinnapillai and others flagged off the rally.\n\nThe Dhan Foundation, which has been spearheading the movement and disseminating the need for clean and green environment for the last nine years, is well supported by very many public sector undertakings, NGOs, service organisations, banks, trade bodies, Corporation of Madurai and other volunteer groups.\n\nLater, when the rallyists reached Gandhi Museum campus, speakers urged the need to keep the environ clean and green. The government and local bodies may introduce laws, impose fines and punish those who violated rules, but a society could really turn clean and green, only when every individual took a pledge to keep it clean.\n\nYouths, particularly students, had more responsibility and should come forward to shape a new India, they added.\n\nAppreciating the large presence of youngsters, the speakers appealed to them to preserve tanks and waterbodies. Natural resources, if neglected, in any form, may lead to disaster. There was an urgent need to imbibe tough decisions as there were enough dangers to the earth, they cautioned.\n\nAs part of the event, folk artistes presented oyilattam among others, which formed part of the rally.",
