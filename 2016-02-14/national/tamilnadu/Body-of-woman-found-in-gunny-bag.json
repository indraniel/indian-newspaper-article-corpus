    "text": "The body of a 21-year-old woman from Uchapatti near Tirumangalam, who reportedly went missing two days back, was found stuffed inside a gunny bag barely 50 metres away from her house on Saturday evening.\n\nPolice sources said that the victim, P. Rajalakshmi (21), who had completed Class XII, was assisting her father Ponraj, aged around 60, in herding goats.\n\nPonraj has reported to Austinpatti police station on Friday that his daughter, who went for herding goats, had gone missing since Thursday. A case was registered by the police on Friday.\n\nWith stench emanating in the area on Saturday, police sources said that a woman from the village, returning from work, spotted the body with the legs alone visible outside the gunny bag.\n\nThe body was found in a decomposed state along with a rope near her neck indicating the possibility of strangulation, police said.\n\nSources said that considering the highly decomposed state of the body, the murder could have happened two days ago elsewhere and the body was possibly dumped near the house on Saturday. The girl\u2019s house was located last in the village in a somewhat secluded manner, police said.\n\nThe missing case registered at Austinpatti police station has been altered to a case of murder.\n\nWhen contacted, Superintendent of Police Vijayendra Bidari said that the motive for the murder was yet to be established and the police were not ruling out anything, including honour killing, now.",
