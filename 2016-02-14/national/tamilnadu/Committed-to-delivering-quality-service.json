Each of the 5,000 Dabbawalas worked with dedication, discipline and passion.\n\nThey carried around two lakh lunch boxes a day with each one travelling 60 \u2013 70 km a day. In the process they had established the reputation of committing an error of 1 for every 16 million transactions.\n\nEarlier the Dabbawala group leader Narayanji entered the campus on a bicycle in typical Dabbawala style.",
