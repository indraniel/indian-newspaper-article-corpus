We have seven ships now and four more would join the base in Chennai this year and another a year later. We are an expanding Navy and we need space,\u201d a Navy officer said.\n\nFor establishing a separate base, a minimum of 100 acres are required, however, if the land is located adjacent to an operational port, the necessity could be less, he said.\n\nAt present, ships and other assets belonging to the Navy and the Coast Guard are berthed in jetties allotted to them. But, the overall control of the campus is with the Chennai Port Trust management.\n\n\u201cEvery time we need to berth a ship, we need to seek space from the port management and it would be allotted to us unlike in our base in Visakhapatnam, where the Navy has its own jetties and separate entrance. Though the port management in Chennai has been prioritising our needs, it would be make a huge difference if we had our own base,\u201d another officer said.\n\nThough there are other bases of the Navy in the State, they all house aviation assets and are not located along the coast. Even in Forward Operation Base (FOB) at Thoothukudi, the Navy ships are being berthed in jetties under the control of V.O. Chidambaranar port\n\n. \u201cWe are planning to have our own jetty in Thoothukudi soon,\u201d he said.\n\nA minimum of\n\n100 acres are\n\nrequired for establishing a separate base",
