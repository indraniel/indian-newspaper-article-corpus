    "text": "A few schools in the city that have managed to uphold inclusive education for their students say that it is a combination of investing in the right resources and aiming towards a holistic environment on campus.\n\n\u201cWe have a series of workshops at the start of the year to ensure that our teachers are prepared and sensitised to inclusive classrooms. During the course of the year, we maintain a steady interaction with the parents of the intellectually challenged children and aid them with special question banks and notes to help the children if they have difficulties in coping with classes,\u201d said Mangala Jayachandran, director of special education, Lady Andal School.\n\nThe school has around 200 children who have been integrated into the mainstream classes.\n\nThe Montfort Matriculation Higher Secondary School in the city too has been working with two nodal agencies that assess children with special needs and certify them as capable to be admitted to mainstream schools.\n\n\u201cThe children who are then referred to us are taken in and we, at present, have about five children for each grade. When they reach class X, we make special provisions for students with special needs to ensure that they are able to cope,\u201d said Rev. Bro. Thomas, School Principal and Correspondent.",
