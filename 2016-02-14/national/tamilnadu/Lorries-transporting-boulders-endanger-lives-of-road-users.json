Nagarajan were allowed to resume quarrying immediately after his transfer from Kanyakumari.\n\nThe transporters resort to overloading to offset the \u201clow margin and high operational cost.'' They pay a nominal fine if charged by the Transport department officials or police. However, the violation, which jeopardises the safety of other road users, especially those driving smaller vehicles such as two wheelers and walkers, has become a norm now. \u201cWe are forced to the edge of the roads when lorries transporting black stone try to overtake us\u2019\u2019 says a social activist.\n\n\u201cWorse still is that they do not cover the load with tarpaulin,'' laments S.R. Sreeram, president, Kanyakumari District Consumer Protection Association.\n\nThe mini lorries/tempos transporting double the weight than the permitted level posed danger to road users, Mr. Sreeram said. \u201cIt is the duty of the Transport and Revenue departments and the police to check the dangerous overloading tendency to prevent accidents on highways,\u201d he said.\n\nThe speeding overloaded tempos/mini lorries could be seen passing through the Collectorate on the Nagercoil-Thiruvananthapuram National Highway unchecked, he pointed out.\n\nR. Rajinikanth, Regional Transport Officer, told The Hindu that the officials were checking overloading of vehicles on specific complaints. Recently, large number of tempos/mini lorries were booked in Rajakkamangalam Road for overloading. Violators were fined Rs. 1000 per tonne of black stone over and above the permissible limit and Rs. 2,000 for the crime. Mr. Rajinikanth said that the department would intensify vehicle check on the NH to curb such violations.",
