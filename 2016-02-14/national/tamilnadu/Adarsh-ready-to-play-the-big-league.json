He realised that pretty soon and quickly switched over. And, it paid rich dividends. Adarsh, now 16, has already represented the country in the FIBA Asia under-16 basketball championship at Jakarta, Indonesia, last year.\n\n\u201cIt was an awesome experience and a great path to advance to the next level,\u201d said the class eleven student of Vidhya Niketan MHSS.\n\nFor the ambitious young star, coached by Mr. Murugeshan of Rajalakshmi Sports Club, it was his first maiden international outing. He played the centre position out there and caught the attention of the game\u2019s lovers. He was also rated among the top ten in Asia and the top five in India.\n\n\u201cIt was my dream playing for India and it was a different ball game altogether. We played the first game against China and lost, but the lessons learnt were many,\u201d said Adarsh, who enjoys a good reach at the ring.\n\nHe did have butterflies in his stomach playing his debut game. \u201cThere were seven footers and I was worried how to cover them. It did affect my game and I was quickly replaced only to get back on court in the second quarter. But after that I was able to handle the situation much better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a totally new experience for me. Everything was new \u2013 the crowd, the court and the atmosphere. It was electric,\u201d he added.\n\nAgainst Hong Kong, Adarsh was at his best. He was shooting from mid range and also earned foul baskets and converted them with ease. \u201cI scored 26 points, my best in an international game,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving tasted success in his first international outing, Adarsh now wants to play more of them. His ultimate dream is to play for the senior India team. \u201cFive years from now, I hope to realise it. I may grow a few inches more and with some extra brushing of skills I am confident of making an impact,\u201d added Adarsh, who is supported by his family members and more specially his mother Raja Rajeswari.\n\nHe thanked the district association, his coach and the school management for the big support over the years.",
