Has the Congress done anything to wash its sins off? The DMK thinks it could take the memory of the people for granted. People of Tamil Nadu are not suffering from collective amnesia,\u201d she charged.\n\nMs. Soundararajan alleged that the Congress-DMK combine was the reason behind the 2G spectrum scandal. \u201cWe will take this to the people. This will be highlighted in our election campaign,\u201d she said.\n\nTamil Maanila Congress vice-president B.S. Gnanadesikan echoed her views.\n\n\u201cIn 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK cited a particular reason for not aligning with the Congress. We want to know if anything has changed or if the DMK has given up on that reasoning,\u201d he said.\n\nCPI (M) State Secretary G. Ramakrishnan said the Congress-DMK pact was nothing to be surprised about.\n\n\u201cMr. Karunanidhi as Chief Minister implemented the same neo-liberal economic policies that the UPA followed at the Centre. In that way, they are natural partners in implementing anti-poor policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018DMK quit the UPA accusing the Congress of letting down Tamils\n\nin Sri Lanka\u2019",
