Sundar, after handing over garbage cleaning autos to 8 village panchayats situated around KKNPP site, said power generation in the first unit had been gradually increased to 715 MWe and the quantum of generation would be increased to take it to the maximum capacity of 1,000 MWe.\n\nThe second unit would be ready for power generation in May as enriched uranium fuel loading would be taken up in the near future after getting the approval of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, he said.\n\nAs Tangedco would get 562 MWe power whenever the first unit of KKNPP achieves its maximum capacity of 1,000 MWe, the announcement on power generation in the second reactor in May will enthuse power managers considering that the demand would be shooting up in the peak of summer.\n\nMr. Sundar said excavation of site for the third and the fourth reactors was progressing as planned.",
