The mobile surveillance mechanism by deploying a camera-fitted vehicle was put in place recently to improve the efficiency of policing and monitoring system.\n\nThe vehicle would move to the designated spot where a public meeting or protest or other forms of stir was to take place to capture \u2018live\u2019 the activities taking place in that area till such time the event gets over. The entire \u2018live\u2019 video footages is stored in a digital video recorder installed inside the police vehicle which is also equipped with a UPS (uninterrupted power supply). This would help the police in taking CDs of such footages if needed to keep watching the activities numerous times as and when required. The system would enable the police monitoring the \u2018live\u2019 activities to pass on information to superiors in case of any suspicious activities to those deployed on the field.\n\nA select band of police personnel have been trained in this mechanism and provided with walkie-talkie sets. In one such mission, the mobile camera vehicle was deployed to cover a demonstration organised by the People\u2019s Welfare Front at Srirangam on Friday. The vehicle was deployed as a precautionary measure during the Kuzhumayee Amman temple festival in Puthur area which attracted devotees a large number of devotees. Police strength in good numbers was deployed for the festival.\n\nWith the assembly elections round the corner, the mobile camera vehicle is expected to be deployed for many missions in the days to come to cover poll-related meetings also.",
