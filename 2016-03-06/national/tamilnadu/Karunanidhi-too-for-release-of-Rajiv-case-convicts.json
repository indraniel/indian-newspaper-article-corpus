    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Saturday said either the Centre or the State government should take steps to release the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case without going into the issue of who had the power to ensure their release.\n\nIn a statement here, he said the State government should invoke its power guaranteed under Article 161 of the Constitution to secure their release or the Centre should issue orders for their release.\n\n\u201cThe Centre should consider the letter written by the State government on humanitarian ground without going into its motive as their release has already been very much delayed,\u201d he said, recalling the editorial of The Hindu that the State government had chosen the legally discredited route for political gains.",
