This was the dream of Dr. M.A.M. Ramasamy, one of the founders of this organisation, whose aim was to spread Tamil Isai free of cost.\n\nAt the beginning of the second programme, Mahati worshipped \u201cVarana Muhava\u201d in hamsadwani and these auspicious lyrics by Koteeswara Iyer were followed by VenkataSubaiyer\u2019s injunction to fear none in ragam Manirangu beginning, \u201cYaar enna sonnalum anjadhe\u201d.\n\n\u201cNambi Kettavar evarayya\u201d followed an in-depth delineation of ragam hindolam by alapana and was rounded off with chittai swarams for the kriti by Papanasam Sivan. \u201cPada vendume\u201d in hamsanandam by Dandapani Desikar and \u201cThaye thripura sundari\u201d in sudha saveri added to the variety.\n\nThe main song was a favourite of stalwarts, the kriti \u201cThiruvadi Charanam\u201d by Gopalakrishna bharathi in kamboji.\n\nN. Sampath\u2019s contributions on the violin to the creative aspects of the song were appreciable. So was the tani by Sai Giridhar on the mridangam and K.V.Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira.\n\n\u201cChinninanjiru kiliye\u201d, \u201cKanda naal mudhal\u201d and a tillana were some of the concluding pieces. A wide range of compositions was thus presented to the rasikas of Madurai.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
