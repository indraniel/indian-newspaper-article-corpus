Rajaraman, chairing a meeting with Superintendent of Police Aravindan and other senior officials, briefed the recognised political party representatives here on Saturday.\n\nThere are 1,872 polling stations in the seven Assembly segments in the district. Each constituency will have three flying squads and three static squads. Sensitive booths and locations have been identified by revenue and police officials. Based on the assessment and need, para-military forces will be deployed for smooth conduct of campaigning and polling.\n\nMr. Rajaraman also informed the meeting that an exclusive control room would function with immediate effect at the Collectorate complex to handle election-related queries. Public can contact at 04562-252466 or in the toll free 1950. All the calls would be recorded and action taken.\n\nHe warned that defacing of public walls by political parties would be viewed seriously. All the instructions of the ECI should be strictly followed by the officials designated for the poll duty, he said.",
