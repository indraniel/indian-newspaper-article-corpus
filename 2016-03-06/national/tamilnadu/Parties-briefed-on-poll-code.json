Veera Raghava Rao organised a meeting on Saturday with representatives of recognised political parties to formally instruct them on the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), which had come into effect since Friday.\n\nReiterating the dos and don\u2019ts as per the MCC, the Collector asked the parties to refrain from appealing to voters by invoking caste or religious feelings. He also told the representatives to avoid attacks of all aspects of private life of party leaders or workers.\n\nThe Collector warned the political parties of stringent action if they indulged in corrupt practices like distribution of cash or other freebies to secure votes.\n\nLater, Mr. Rao inspected the functioning of flying squads and static surveillance teams, which began their work on Friday, in all the 10 assembly constituencies in the district.\n\nSources at the Collectorate said that fitting of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices in 60 vehicles allocated for flying squads and static surveillance teams to monitor their movement would begin from Monday.",
