    "text": "A CrossBoss catheter, a device used to treat 100 per cent blocked arteries, was introduced recently at the Apollo Specialty Hospitals in Vanagaram.\n\nAccording to a press release, the catheter, made of stainless steel braid with a rounded tip, can be rotated in any direction to our convenience.\n\nThis facilitates the crossing of the block, either through tough lesions, or travelling behind the blocked segment and exiting beyond the lesions.\n\nAt this point, a StingRay balloon is used to get back into the passage of the blood vessel using specialised wires.\n\nGenerally, cardiac surgeries are used to treat 100 per cent blocked arteries, but with newer technology \u2014 such as the CrossBoss catheter and StingRay balloon, the blocks can be cleared through angioplasties, with minimum hospital stays, leading to faster recovery and improved outcomes, the press release said.",
