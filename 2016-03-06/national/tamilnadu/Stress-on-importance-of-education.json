People could come out of the poverty line if they were educated and asserted their rights, he said.\n\nThe aged poor who faced problems in getting Old Age Pension (OAP) could approach the legal services authority for relief, he said adding the unemployed graduates could also approach the authority for getting bank loans for starting their own ventures.\n\nPeople could approach the Alternative Disputes Resolution Centre (ADRC) and attend lok adalts to settle their pending and pre-litigation disputes.\n\nThey could avail free services of advocates if they approached the legal aid centre, he added.\n\nBenefits detailed\n\nJudicial Magistrate II N.
