Vaira Manikandan (36), he received a call on his mobile phone about a week ago from a person claiming to be calling from the head office of the public sector bank, in which Mr. Vaira Manikandan had an account. He was allegedly told by the person that the validity period of his ATM debit card was being extended up to 2040 and was asked to share the PIN of his card to complete the process.\n\nDeceived by the caller, Mr. Vaira Manikandan shared the PIN. However, he came to know later that Rs. 25,000 had been withdrawn from his account without his knowledge.\n\nSilaiman police have registered a cheating case.",
