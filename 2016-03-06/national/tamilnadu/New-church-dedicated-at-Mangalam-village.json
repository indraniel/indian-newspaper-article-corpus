    "text": "A new church constructed in memory of Edith Emily Dignum in Mangalam village in Tiruchengode block was dedicated here recently.\n\nIn 1912, G. Matthew began his missionary in the village that earlier came under the Salem district. Later, T.C. Vitney stayed in the village three times a month and was involved in missionary activities. More Christians joined the missionary. However, in 1922, famine and drought forced people in the village to move to Sri Lanka and work in plantations.\n\nIn 1926, T.C. Vitney constructed a small church in the village and also quarters for the workers.\n\nE.E. Dignum, a missionary for Salem and Namakkal, died at the age of 32 due to intense heat. Hence, the C.S.I. Edith Emily Dignum Centenary Memorial Church was dedicated to her. Foundation stone for the church was laid on August 6, 2012 and work was completed recently.\n\nT.C. Vitney was also remembered.\n\nMembers of Salem Historical Society including its general secretary J. Barnabas participated.",
