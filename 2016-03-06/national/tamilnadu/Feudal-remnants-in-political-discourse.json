But, they have not been able to shake off the pre-modern signifiers in their discourse,\u201d he wrote on social media later.\n\nAcademics and political commentators unanimously agree that the use of feudal signifiers is the result of rhetoric developed by the Dravidian parties in the early days of its inception. \u201cThe political rhetoric of the Dravidian movement has always relied on Tamil militarist imagination. C.N. Annadurai made frequent references to military exploits of the Tamils not just as a glorification of Tamils\u2019 past, but vitally as a mobilisation strategy during the anti-Hindi agitations. We must read the current usage of terms like \u2018king\u2019, \u2018commander\u2019 etc as a product of this legacy,\u201d says Karthick RM, a scholar from University of Essex, whose thesis is based on the works of Frantz Fanon and Periyar.\n\nAnother point of view has it that Dravidian parties have always invoked such ideas using fancy language to get the cadre up to speed. \u201cThe Dravidian party leaders have relied on aduku mozhi vasanam or word play, because their cadre liked and admired it. Sometimes, the message is not deemed important. For a party that was formed for the purpose of spreading rationalism and social justice and spoke of strengthening federalism, their obsession with Tamil literary figures such as Kannagi and hero worship have become a problem,\u201d said Punitha Pandian, editor, Dalit Murasu .\n\nDespite the progressive politics of Dravidian parties, especially of the DMK, the leaders have always appealed to the emotive cultural identity of the Tamil electorate, said Ramu Manivannan, professor of politics, Madras University.\n\n\u201cIndian society is largely feudal. The parties also appeal to the primordial values of society. We have already accepted caste and family successions as a part of democratic politics. The parties could have gone ahead and changed the political imagination, but it is the leaders who need to be blamed for this current sorry state,\u201d he said",
