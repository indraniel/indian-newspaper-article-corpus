Manikumar and C.T. Selvam made the observation while reversing an order passed by a Family Court which had refused to entertain an application for divorce for want of sufficient evidence to prove that the applicant was married.\n\nThe Family Court in Tirunelveli had rejected the application filed by the wife, since she had not produced either a marriage registration certificate or a wedding invitation or at least photographs of the wedding. Though the woman had produced another photograph taken along with her husband, the lower court judge held that there was no corroborating evidence to prove that the person in that photograph was her husband from whom she had sought divorce. To substantiate his conclusion, the judge had also relied upon a settlement deed, between the applicant and the person from whom she had sought divorce, wherein it was stated that she would reside with him and attend to his needs throughout his life time.\n\nDisagreeing with the reasons given by the lower court judge, the Division Bench said that they \u201creflect a most presumptuous view on considerations which are matters for trial\u201d and not to be decided at the preliminary stage of entertaining a divorce petition.\n\nFurther, pointing out that the woman had claimed to have got married about 21 years ago and had also begotten two children through her husband, the Bench said: \u201cWe may also observe that a presumption of marriage may arise even on proof of prolonged cohabitation.\u201d",
