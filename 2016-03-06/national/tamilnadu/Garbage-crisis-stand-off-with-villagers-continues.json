    "text": "The stand-off over two waste processing plants continued on Friday with residents of Kannahalli and Seegehalli refusing to allow any garbage-laden truck to reach the units.\n\nThis has raised serious concerns about a garbage crisis in the city, as 600 tonnes of wet waste that was being sent to the two plants each day is now being diverted to Lingadheeranahalli, Doddabidarakallu and Mavallipura units.\n\nThis has raised fear that villagers surrounding these plants too may rise in protest.\n\nHundreds of villagers demanding closure of the two plants blocked a garbage truck at Seegehalli Gate on Friday afternoon. They had not released the vehicle till this report was filed. Some protesters are sleeping at Seegehalli Gate due to a suspicion that BBMP will attempt to dump waste at night.\n\nBBMP officials claimed that the truck was not sent to the Kannahalli-Seegehalli plants, but to the one in Lingadheeranahalli.\n\nChannappa, president, Kannahalli-Seegehalli Kasa Vilevari Horata Samithi, said they would not back off till the plants were closed.\n\nSarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, said that while the demand to close the plants is unacceptable, they have taken the private firm running the two plants to task for odour and leachate issues and have given a two-week deadline to fix the problem.\n\nFor the second straight day, villagers blocked a garbage truck at Seegehalli Gate",
