The revamped Flemingo Duty Free is expected to be opened over the next 2-3 months.\n\nPre-order items online\n\nWhile the Chennai Duty Free shop is undergoing a makeover, it had introduced online pre-ordering service under which its digital shopping portal gives its buyers the option to browse its catalogue of products, pre-order items online, and collect the items at the dedicated duty free shop upon arrival or departure at the Chennai airport by showing the passport and boarding pass.",
