However, why the girls decided upon taking this step is unclear.\n\nAbout a month ago, claimed Roopa*, 12, one of the girls, two of her classmates decided to take a mobile phone that they saw on the window ledge of a house a few streets away from their homes. The phone was hidden in Roopa\u2019s schoolbag.\n\n\u201cBut the man whose phone it was found out, came, and shouted. We returned the phone,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a part of the phone or its pouch was missing, apparently thrown away by her classmate Saranya*, recollected Roopa.\n\nAfter some trouble though, the issue seemed more or less resolved.\n\nBut, a few days ago, Roopa said, there was a minor argument between a few of her classmates. \u201cOur teacher shouted at them,\u201d she said. The man whose mobile phone was stolen also reportedly shouted at the girls again.\n\nThough it is unclear why, Saranya and Venilla*, according to Roopa, decided they would take lice medicine. On Wednesday, one of the girls brought the lice medicine from home. The girls drank a solution of it at lunchtime.\n\nPrema*, an 11-year-old friend of theirs, curious about the \u2018juice\u2019 her friends were drinking, wanted to try it too.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was. I asked them to give me some of the \u2018milk\u2019 and drank it,\u201d she said. Roopa too, took one mouthful, she said.\n\nWhile Venilla seemed to be fine, Roopa said, the other three fell sick, with the most affected being Saranya. \u201cMy stomach hurt and my legs were trembling,\u201d said Roopa. The girls were treated at the hospital.\n\n\u201cWhat they took was probably a carbamate \u2013 an organo-phospherous insecticide.\n\nSaranya* was not in good shape at first, but all three of them have recovered,\u201d said a senior hospital official.\n\nOne horrified mother said she had no idea this had happened, and had at first thought it was a case of food poisoning.\n\n\u201cThe mobile phone issue had been resolved. I don\u2019t know why they did this,\u201d she said. A father of one of the girls said none of them were giving a clear reason as to why they had done this.\n\nThe students were rushed to the hospital and later referred to the Institute of Child Health, Egmore",
