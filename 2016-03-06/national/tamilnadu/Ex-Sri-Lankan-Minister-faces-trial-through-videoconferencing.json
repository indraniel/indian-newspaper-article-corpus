    "text": "Former Sri Lankan Minister Douglas Devananda, an accused in a 30-year-old murder case, appeared before a sessions court here through videoconferencing from the Indian High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The special arrangement was made in view of a Madras High Court order dated September 10, 2014, allowing Devananda\u2019s plea to stand trial through videoconferencing.\n\nThe issue pertains to an alleged shoot out by a group headed by Devananda in 1986 at Choolaimedu on the eve of Deepavali. One person, Thirunavukkarasu, was killed in the crossfire.\n\nDevananda and nine others were arrested. All the accused managed to abscond after coming out on bail and non-bailable warrants (NBW) were issued against them.\n\nThe trial could not be proceeded with as other accused in the case were absconding. But decks were cleared last October by splitting up the case to hear charges against Devananda.\n\nEventually, the trial commenced on January 18 with the examination of Gurumoorthy, a key witness in the case.",
