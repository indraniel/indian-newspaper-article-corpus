A scene at the Poonamallee bridge near Chennai on Saturday.\u2014 Photo: B. Jothi Ramalingam\n\nWithin a day after the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) came into force after the announcement of Assembly polls in the State, at least 106 complaints have been received by the Election Commission officials alleging violations.\n\n\u201cSo far there have been 106 complaints of people issuing tokens for receiving government schemes, non removal of portraits, etc. We are looking into them and will take action,\u201d Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said.\n\nThe EC officials were also removing or covering the paintings, pictures and portraits of political leaders and other symbols, which could be associated with political parties and are displayed in public places. \u201cAll of them will be removed by Sunday,\u201d he said. If the instructions of the Election Commission were not followed, action could be taken under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), he said. One of the instructions restrained parties and individuals from criticising the private lives of political leaders or individuals.\n\nAll the 234 Assembly constituencies in Tamil Nadu and 30 constituencies in the Union Territory of Puducherry would be going for a single-phase polling on May 16 and the results are to be announced on May 19, the Election Commission of India announced on Friday.",
