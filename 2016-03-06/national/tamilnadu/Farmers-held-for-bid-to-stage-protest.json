The police removed 34 farmers and lodged them in a marriage hall.\n\nThey were demanding diversion of surplus water from 16-vent Ellis Saddle surplus channel in Stanley Reservoir in Mettur Dam to Sarabanga River and Thirumanimutharu River so that areas in Mecheri would be benefitted.\n\nThey had earlier obtained permission for staging protest.\n\nHowever, since the Model Code of Conduct was in force, permission to stage the protest was cancelled. When they attempted to stage protest, they were removed.",
