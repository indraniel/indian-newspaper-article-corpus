    "text": "Coracle operators continue to differ with the district administration over the multi-tier safety overhaul in Hogenakkal. The administration permits only a single-route coracle operation from Mamarathukadavu jetty.\n\nCurrently, coracles are being launched when the water level is below 9,000 cusecs. Once the level crosses the threshold in Mamarathukadavu, the operations will have to be shutdown. Coracles were traditionally operated from three different routes. Depending on the water flow, the operations were moved as and when the water level shifted.\n\nSince June, the level had risen to 25,000 cusecs. Coracle operations were traditionally shifted to Uthamalai Parisal Thurai (Uthamalai coracle jetty) in such situations, said Kempuraj, president, Hogenakkal Coracle Riders Association.\n\nWhen the level crosses 25,000 cusecs, coracles would be launched from Kothikal Parisal Thurai. \u201cWhen the level reaches 60,000 cusecs or one lakh cusecs, it is still safe to operate from Kothikal Parisal Thurai, where it has still waters. Tourists are shown Karnataka pass from this point,\u201d says Mr. Kempuraj.\n\nHowever, the blanket shutting down of operations once water crosses 9,000 cusecs would affect round-the-year livelihood of coracle ridershe added.\n\nWhen contacted, Collector K. Vivekanandan said that the demand was premature, since the current water level was barely 5,000 cusecs. The need would arise only after June, when the level would rise.",
