Govarthan\n\nFarmers of Chinnathambipalayam village in Anthiyur block where rekla races are conducted with fanfare years ago wonder why the \u2018harmless\u2019 form of celebration must be banned.\n\n\u201cThere is no harm caused to animals in the race. When dogs and horses are made to run during entertainment shows to regale the audience, there is no reason why bullocks must be banned,\u201d a villager reasoned out.\n\nBullocks are also used to plough the fields and draw carts. If physical exertion to animal is the criteria, use of animals for domestic purposes also fall in the purview of banning.\n\nIn rural parts of Erode district, the horns of bullocks are being shaped and painted. The robust ones are made to run for four to 8 km as in the Southern district, farmers said.\n\nNevertheless, the faming community in Anthiyur, Gobi, Modakurichi and other rural parts have not lost hope. Even at short notice, rekla events could be organised with traditional fervour though the scale of celebration would be limited, the villagers say.",
