Velumani extended the interim order at the request of senior counsel M. Ajmal Khan appearing for the DMDK leader who had sought anticipatory bail. The hearing on the advance bail application was adjourned to January 25 at the request of Government Advocate A.P. Balasubramani who urged the court to defer the hearing by two weeks for getting instructions from the police.\n\nIn his petition, Mr. Vijayakant apprehended that he might be arrested for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147 and 547 of the Indian Penal Code apart from Section 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act, 1992 on the basis of a complaint lodged by an AIADMK MLA M. Rengasamy on December 28. Claiming that the complainant had accused him of having directed his partymen to remove a hoarding containing a picture of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa near a bus shelter , the petitioner accused the AIADMK partymen of having intentionally erected the hoarding next to the venue of a protest meeting organised by his party .",
