    "text": "In 2008, when senior IAS officer Niranjan Mardi was Commissioner of Municipal Administration, he inspected the Pandian Nedunchezian Higher Secondary School and ordered construction of a building for a library after he was informed that books intended for the library were lying idle.\n\nAfter the newly built library was inaugurated, the Corporation approached the Employment Exchange seeking a list of candidates to be interviewed for appointment as librarian. But the Employment Exchange refused since there was no sanctioned post. Finally, a three-member panel comprising the Corporation Commissioner was formed and a candidate was selected on a consolidated pay of Rs. 3,500 per month from February 2009. Thus, the Corporation posted Kanaga Durga, a qualified librarian, at the school. The library, started with 400 books, has close to 12,000 books today. Recently, when Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa, Collector L. Subramanian and Commissioner C. Kathiravan visited the school, they appreciated the upkeep of the library and enhanced the librarian\u2019s salary to Rs. 10,000 per month. Very soon, the library would be modernised, Ms. Kanaga Durga said with confidence and hoped that philanthropists would continue their patronage.\n\nIt is to be seen whether the Corporation would take the example of the school in Madurai in setting up a library, at least one in each zone to start with.",
