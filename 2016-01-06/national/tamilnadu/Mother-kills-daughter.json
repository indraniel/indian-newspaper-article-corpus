    "text": "A four-year-old girl was found murdered inside a field at Kowlpalayam near here on Monday.\n\nThe police suspected her mother A. Mallika (22) as she did not show any sign of grief over her daughter\u2019s death. She confessed to have committed the murder during interrogation. So she was arrested on Tuesday. She told the police that her daughter had seen her with a man with whom she was said to have had illicit intimacy. Fearing that the girl would convey the affair to her father Annadurai, who was working as a labourer in Rajasthan, Mallika took her daughter to a farm and allegedly strangulated her to death. The woman returned home and thereafter went in search of the girl along with some locals.",
