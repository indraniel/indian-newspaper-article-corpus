When he opened it, the worker found the naked body of a woman and it did not have a head.\n\nHe immediately alerted the police and they searched for the head of the woman in other garbage bins nearby. \u201cThey also searched for it in a nearby canal and the bushes. But there was no trace of it,\u201d said a police source.\n\nThe police have sent the information to other police stations across the State to check if there was any woman-missing complaint.\n\n\u201cThe spot where the body was found is not a well-illuminated despite it being a highway. We suspect that the murder would have taken place elsewhere and the body would have been brought in a vehicle and dumped here,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nThe police are checking for CCTV footage from nearby buildings. \u201cWe are also checking footage from the nearby toll gates. We are doing an investigation based on the bed sheet wrapped around the body. We will nab the culprits soon,\u201d said an officer.\n\nThe body has been sent to the Government Royapettah Hospital for a post-mortem examination.\n\n25-year-old\n\n\u201cThe body appears to be that of a 25-year-old woman. We are waiting for a request from the police to conduct the autopsy. No relatives have come claiming the body so far,\u201d said a source from the hospital.\n\nSanitary worker finds it wrapped\n\nin a bedsheet near a garbage bin, alerts police",
