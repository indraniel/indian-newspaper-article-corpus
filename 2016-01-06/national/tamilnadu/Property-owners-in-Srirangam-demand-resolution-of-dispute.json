    "text": "Expressing concern over the continuing stalemate in the dispute between them and the Srirangam Sri Ranganthaswamy Temple with respect to the ownership of properties around the temple, a committee of residents of Srirangam has urged the Chief Minister to find a solution to the problem before the notification of the Assembly election.\n\nAt a consultative meeting, the Adimanai Urimai Meetpukuzhu, a committee of residents of Srirangam, pointed out that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa during the election campaign in 2011 had promised to find a solution to the vexed problem. However, even after four-and-a-half years, a solution has not been found, a resolution adopted at a consultative meeting of the forum held here on Sunday said. The meeting was chaired by S. Natarajan and attended by B. Hemanathan, president, and Dikshithar Balasubramanian.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that large number of property owners with title deeds were not able to sell or pledge their properties after the temple authorities claimed ownership rights as per a title deed (number 1027) issued in 1866 under which temple authorities claim that 320 acres belong to the temple.\n\nSince people were not able to get building plan approvals, century old structures were crumbling leading to loss of lives, the resolution said. Another resolution urged the government to issue an order declaring the 1027 deed void and enable people sell or buy the properties. If the government failed to issue an order before the election notification, the committee would field 108 candidates in Srirangam constituency for the election, another resolution said.\n\nA committee of residents threatens to field 108 candidate in Assembly polls",
