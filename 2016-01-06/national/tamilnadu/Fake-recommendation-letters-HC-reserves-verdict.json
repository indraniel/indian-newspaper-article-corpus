    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday reserved its judgment on a petition seeking a police inquiry into many appointments and transfers made in State-run liquor shops by producing \u201cfake\u201d recommendation letters issued in the name of Natham R. Viswanathan, Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise.\n\nJustice M. Venugopal deferred his verdict without mentioning a date after arguments advanced by Additional Advocate General (AAG) K. Chellapandian on behalf of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) and advocate N. Satish Babu appearing on behalf of the petitioner B. Selvam, a liquor shop supervisor.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel produced a few transfer orders issued by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) officials and claimed that most of them had reference to recommendations made either by the Minister or his PA Selvam. He claimed that the DVAC did not register a case despite submitting the letters along with a complaint.\n\nRebuttal\n\nFurther, referring to the DVAC Manual, he contended that the sleuths were duty-bound to conduct a discreet preliminary inquiry immediately after the receipt of any complaint and then begin a detailed inquiry if they find that there were prima facie materials against the accused.\n\nRebutting the allegations, the AAG said the DVAC did not register a case since the petitioner himself had accepted that only \u201cfake\u201d recommendation letters had been issued in the name of the Minister.\n\nHowever, he said the DVAC had duly forwarded the complaint lodged by the petitioner to the MD of Tasmac for action.",
