    "text": "A member of a women\u2019s organisation has also filed a writ appeal in the Madras High Court Bench here challenging a particular dress code framed and imposed by a single judge of the High Court on devotees and all other visitors to temples under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department in the State.\n\nThis is the second writ appeal on the issue as the State Government had already filed an appeal challenging the single judge\u2019s order on several grounds, including the correctness of compelling temple goers to adhere to a uniform dress code across the State and the fact that individual temples were free to prescribe separate dress code according to their customs.\n\nIn her appeal, G. Sarika (22) of Southern Districts Women Federation, claimed that the dress code was against an individual\u2019s right to wear a dress of his/her choice.\n\nAlso claiming that the single judge order was \u201chighly discriminatory,\u201d the appellant claimed that the restrictions imposed by the judge were against \u201cfundamental rights, particularly of women and children.\u201d\n\nDisposing of a writ petition seeking permission for cultural programmes in view of a temple festival in Tiruchi district, Justice S. Vaidyanathan had on November 26 ordered that from January 1 onwards, men should wear \u201cdhoti or pyjama with upper cloth or formal pants and shirts\u201d and women \u201csari or half sari with blouse or churidhar with upper cloth\u201d to temples.\n\nThe Judge also ordered that children could go in \u201cany fully-covered dress.\u201d",
