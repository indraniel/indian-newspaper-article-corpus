    "text": "The Department of Education, in its efforts to improve the pass percentage of students in Class X, has released a booklet of possible exam questions and answers, to be distributed free of cost to all government school students.\n\nChief Minister N. Rangasamy formally released the booklet, last week, and handed it over to a few students. The Education Minister T. Thiagarajan and Education Secretary G.Ragesh Chandra were also present on the occasion.\n\nFree of cost\n\nOnce the books are printed and ready, they will be distributed free of cost during the Class X guidance program, \u2018Sigarathai Noki\u2019 that the Education Department conducts every year.\n\nIt is expected that the programme will be held in the last week, said N. Ramalingam, Chief Educational Officer.\n\nThe officials also said studying from the question bank alone will guarantee a minimum pass mark for all the students.\n\nAlthough it is important to guarantee passing, the Department decided to release the question bank a little later to allow the students to study their subjects independent of the booklet.\n\nThe booklet is meant to be only a supplementary study aid.\n\nCommittees formed\n\nThe Department formed committees of five teachers for each subject, who analysed the previous year\u2019s question papers and prepared the booklet using common questions and best possible answers to these questions. The Department will be printing 7500 copies of the booklets.",
