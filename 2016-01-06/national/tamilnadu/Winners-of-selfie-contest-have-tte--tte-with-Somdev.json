I never imagined I would one day meet and receive a prize from him,\u201d said M. Aravind, a chemical engineering student of IIT Madras, one of the winners on day one. On what prompted him to enter the contest, he said, \u201cAll we had to do was click a good selfie.\u201d\n\nR. Ashok, also an engineering student, Sneha Shankar, a dentist, M. Saravanan, an IT employee, and Rajeev were the other winners on Monday. In the contest, fans are expected to record their reactions to their tennis moments with selfies \u2013 both snapshots and videos -- and post them on Facebook/Twitter using #SportstarLive.\n\nEvery day, the best five are identified and rewarded with two passes for the tournament which runs till Sunday (January 10). The participants can also mail their entries to connect@thehindu.co.in.\n\nAs a sports buff, Aravind was smitten early by the effortless craft of the Swiss maestro, Roger Federer. \u201cI\u2019m a Federer fan big-time. The grace and elegance that he brings into his game is unmatched. He\u2019s an artist while the others play like boxers,\u201d he gushes.\n\nIt turned out to be a pleasant surprise when Aravind was intimated that he had won. \u201cI was taken aback. I was informed about it only a couple of hours before the prize distribution.\u201d\n\nM. Aravind, an IIT-M student, was on cloud nine when he met the star",
