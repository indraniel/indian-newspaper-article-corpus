These, however, may be a thing of the past with the Southern Railway installing a couple of giant LED screens in addition to plasma TVs at this bustling station.\n\nThree LED screens have been installed on the concourse of the station where passengers wait to board long-distance trains.\n\nWhile the screen at the centre displays the arrival and departure of trains, the two screens flanking it telecast entertainment shows, commercials, movie trailers and other messages.\n\nThe screens were installed over a month ago.\n\nA number of small LED screens have also been connected.\n\n\u201cThe giant screens are helpful. Earlier, we had to crowd around small TV screens to be updated with timings of train arrivals and departures,\u201d said Narendra, a software professional who was waiting to board a train.",
