The singer worked hard at bringing out the essence of Mayamalavagowlai all through the song.\n\nA few phrases in Anandabharavi were sung before Shyama Shastri\u2019s \u201cMarivere\u201d which set the tone of gentle entreaty that the singer complemented with a neraval on \u201cSada nammithi Meenakshi\u201d, who favours her devotees with good fortune.\n\nIn all his efforts he was ably supported by the members of his team, R.K.Shriramkumar on the violin, K.V.Prasad on the mridangam, and Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira.\n\nThe singer then took on the pleasurable task of delineating Todi, along with the violinist for Sivan\u2019s \u201cKarthikeya Kangeya\u201d, first with an alapana, and later through free flowing Kalpana swaras in three speeds. This was followed by a scintillating tani by percussionists.\n\nThe rigorous raga elaboration and well-timed tana presentation for the pallavi, \u201cMamava\u201d rounded off with swaras in Ragamalika, were well received by rasikas. The lines of the pallavi were credited to the violinist, R.K.Sriramkumar. He concluded the concert with an ashtapathi in Nadanamakritya.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
