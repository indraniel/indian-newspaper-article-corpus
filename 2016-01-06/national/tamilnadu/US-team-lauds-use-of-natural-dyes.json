After depending so much on technology, it is astonishing to know people are relying on natural products to make saris. This knowledge should be definitely shared to promote the importance of natural ingredients,\u201d said Ms. Carrie.\n\nShe appreciated the efforts of women weavers who wanted to showcase to the world that using natural fibres was viable, she said.\n\nThey had plans to display Anakaputhur weavers\u2019 works in a gallery at their centre, she added.\n\nAnakaputhur Weavers Association president C.
