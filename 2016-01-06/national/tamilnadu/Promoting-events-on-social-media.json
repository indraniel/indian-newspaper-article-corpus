Most of exhibitions now also have Facebook page and video clippings of the previous editions to attract the crowds.\n\nManju P. Pillai, Postmaster General, Western Region, says there is a marginal impact of technology on the volume of advertisement materials, invites and pamphlets that are sent by post. However, the business processing centre at the head post office continues to receive invites and pamphlets in bulk.\n\n\u201cI think there is more credibility when people read about events in print. Hence, organisers who send out invites or share information on social media also count on a printed invite or flyer,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso, she points out, printed material is still the way to reach out to customers in rural areas who may not use social media so extensively. So sending printed material through post is here to stay for a while longer.\n\nReporting by\n\nM. Soundariya Preetha",
