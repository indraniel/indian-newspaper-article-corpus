    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Tuesday granted two more months\u2019 time to Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) to complete investigation into the abduction and murder of former Transport Minister K.N. Nehru\u2019s brother K.N. Ramajeyam by unidentified assailants in Tiruchi on March 29, 2012.\n\nJustice M. Venugopal granted time after accepting Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian\u2019s submission that the investigating agency had left no stone unturned to get to the real culprit and that it had been exploring every clue with great earnestness as had been explained in five confidential status reports filed before the court in the last one year.\n\n\u2018Full faith in court\u2019\n\nSenior counsel R. Shanmugasundaram, appearing for the victim\u2019s wife, R. Latha Ramajeyam, who approached the High Court in December 2014 seeking a CBI probe, said that he had full faith in the court and therefore he would leave it to the court to peruse the confidential report and take decision on granting time as sought for by the CB-CID.\n\n\u201cI am not questioning the competence of the CB-CID. I am only concerned over the case not having been cracked for nearly four years now. If the court feels that the investigating agency should be granted some more time, then I will not stand in the way,\u201d the senior counsel told the judge who, in turn, said that the CB-CID had claimed to have made some progress which could not be disclosed at present.",
