I reiterate my request for early sanction of the proposal.\u201d\n\nShe further urged the Prime Minister to personally intervene on this issue and requested him to take up with the Sri Lankan government to secure the immediate release of 104 fishermen and 66 fishing boats presently in Sri Lankan custody.\n\nEight fishermen from Nagapattinam district were arrested on January 4, and eight from Ramanathapuram district and four from Pudukkottai district were arrested by the Lankan Navy the following day.\n\nJayalalithaa writes to Prime Minister yet again\n\nseeking his interference",
