I therefore request the Central team to make an in-depth assessment of the damage suffered by the State and to submit its report to the Ministry of Home Affairs expeditiously,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa told the team and thanked the Prime Minister for sending the same team, according to an official release.\n\nThe State government has sought Rs. 25,912 crore for relief and restoration efforts.\n\nThe release also quoted Mr. Prasad as saying, \u201cThere was widespread appreciation in the Ministries of Government of India about the prompt manner in which the State government machinery rose to the occasion and attended to rescue, relief and restoration work. The State government was successful in preventing outbreak of any epidemic by timely measures such as chlorination and health camps.\u201d",
