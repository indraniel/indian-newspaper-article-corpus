Guha Prasad, Superintending Engineer of the Highways Department here.\n\nIt may be noted that the toll collection on the present two-lane road by Madurai Corporation, which maintained it until recently, was stopped after opposition from the public. Sources said any unexpected delay in the bid approval could stop the commencement of the work as the model code of conduct for the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections might come in place around that time.\n\nThe Highways Department sources said that the work, once commenced, would be likely to be completed in a year except for the widening of the three bridges in the 27.2-km stretch, which might take more time.\n\n\u201cThe road, however, will remain usable for the vehicles even during the work,\u201d said A.K. Rajadurai Veerapandian, Divisional Engineer.\n\nThe Ring Road, laid more than 15 years ago from the Meenakshi Mission Hospital to Kappalur to reduce congestion in the city, provides crucial connectivity for the vehicles from the north to south going through Madurai.\n\nWhile the road could handle traffic when it was inaugurated, over the years, the traffic exceeded the road capacity. The increased traffic coupled with poor maintenance made the road accident-prone.",
