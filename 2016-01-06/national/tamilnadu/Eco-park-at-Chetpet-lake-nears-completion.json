Around 70 per cent of the work, estimated to cost Rs. 42 crore, is said to be complete.\n\nWhile many residents of the neighbourhood have welcomed the initiative, a few have misgivings about it. They are apprehensive that the project would shrink the size of the lake.\n\nThe water body, which is spread over nine acres, is part of a 15-acre space owned by the Fisheries Department.\n\nResidents said that earlier, the water body was overgrown with vegetation and its water level was a cause for concern.\n\nFollowing the heavy rains in November and December, the lake is brimming with water and the islands are not visible anymore, having submerged in the water.\n\nV. O. Balagangadharan, a resident of Chetpet, said this project would help protect the lake and, more importantly, save a groundwater recharge source in the city.\n\nPradip M. Jog of Nowroji Street Residents\u2019 Welfare Association, said: \u201cImprovements in the lake are progressing at a slow pace. The work had started a year ago. The lake\u2019s size has slightly shrunk. But there\u2019s more water after it was deepened. People are already fishing in the lake. The government must sustain restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nThe Fisheries department completed work to strengthen the bund and deepen the lake. Department officials said work was on to provide a recreation centre, sea food court, compound wall and multi-level car parking on the premises. A track for people to walk or jog would be laid around the lake. Visitors also have the option of a boat ride.\n\nA portion of the lake would also be provided with spots for angling. At present, the Department is breeding freshwater fish varieties such as carp, tilapia, cutla and rohu.",
