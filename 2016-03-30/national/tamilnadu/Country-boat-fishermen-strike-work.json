These kerosene-based engines were being used only for manoeuvring the boats from the coast to the fishing spots in the sea and not for trawling purposes, for which these engines with lesser capacity could not be used.\n\nNo deep sea fishing\n\nMoreover, the country boat fishermen could not carry out deep sea fishing operations owing to smaller size of their craft and lesser capacity of the engines.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983 was made in the Assembly on February 20, 2016 which prohibited fishing operations by country boats with a capacity of more than 8 HP within three nautical miles from the shore.\n\nRs. 50,000 fine\n\nAny violation in this regard would attract a fine of Rs. 50,000, the amendment said.\n\nSince the outboard engines fitted in the country boats were being used only for reaching the spot where the fishermen manually carried out their operations, it was not at used for harvesting fishes as was being done by the mechanised boats and trawlers. Hence, this amendment, which would certainly wipe out the livelihood of the country boat fishermen, should be withdrawn, the fishermen said.\n\nAs a mark of protest, the country boat fishermen abstained from all fishing activities on Tuesday.",
