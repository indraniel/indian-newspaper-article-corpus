The two Dravidian parties that had ruled for five decades did not bother about the livelihood of the people, who were forced to migrate to the metropolis like Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai.\n\n\u201cBy bringing in more industrial units here and through improved techniques of agriculture with additional investment by the government, we will create more job opportunities and bring back people who migrated from villages,\u201d he said.",
