    "text": "The responsibility of teachers, parents and the community at large, in reinforcing the concept of inclusive education propagated under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) was highlighted through a cultural performance at the Panchayat Union School at Nadhagoundampalayam recently.\n\nArtistes from the Bengaluru-based South Asia Regional Office of CBM, an international organisation working for improving the quality of life of differently abled in poor communities, and Nagercoil-based Neighbourhood Community Network drove home the importance of creating an ideal atmosphere for inclusive education in regular schools, T. Thomas Antony, teacher at the PU School, said.\n\nThere were different components to the awareness initiative envisaged to reach out to parents, the community, the teachers, and the school heads, in order to make the stake-holders understand their respective roles. The social organisations intend to cover 15 districts through its awareness programme that calls upon parents of differently abled children to enrol the latter in nearby government schools. The cultural performers also drew the attention of the Government to its responsibility to appoint special teachers in regular schools and provide the requisite paraphernalia, as in Special Schools, for training the differently abled children.\n\nSpecial teachers need to develop the general knowledge of such children and provide them equal opportunities to excel by teaching them poetry and essay writing, and the school heads have to make sure that the toilets are maintained in hygienic condition for use by the children, the organisations emphasised.",
