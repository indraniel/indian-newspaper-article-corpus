    "text": "Traders, who sell wares on push carts in the vicinity of Sri Brihadeeswarar Temple and who were asked to vacate their shops, staged a protest here on Monday.\n\nLed by Small Traders\u2019 Association president Jayakumar, they said 33 small traders had been doing business for some time but the corporation officials came on Monday and confiscated their goods from some of the push carts. Sensing trouble, other push cart traders themselves took away the wares. Seeking justice and space for earning their livelihood, the traders rushed to the Collector\u2019s Office.\n\nCollector N. Subbaiyan asked them to meet the Superintendent of Police for relief. Dissatisfied with his reply, the traders continued their stir. After some officials held discussion with them, the traders withdrew their protest late in the night.",
