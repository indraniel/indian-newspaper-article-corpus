    "text": "Even as Tiruchi is considered as a model city in managing community toilets and bathing complexes, the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation plans to undertake a fresh survey on prevalence of open defecation so as to take remedial measures.\n\nIt is mainly aimed at improving the overall sanitary management of the city.\n\nSources told The Hindu that N.S. Prema, corporation Commissioner, has instructed the officials to undertake a detailed survey on open defecation.\n\nIt would cover all areas, including developed areas, declared and undeclared slums in the city. Enumerators would soon be identified for the survey.\n\nThe survey would list the community toilets, public toilets, bathing complexes, mobile toilets, and others at Central Bus Stand, Chathram Bus Stand, thickly populated areas and slums. It would figure out the functional condition of them.\n\nSimilarly, the enumerators would fan out to various areas where open defecation and open urination are rampant. They would note down the behaviour of people in slum areas in using the public toilets.\n\nThe sources said the survey would be completed within May so as to have a blueprint on sanitary management in the city soon after the end of State elections. The corporation would then devise a plan to build more public toilets and community toilets on priority.\n\nIt said the move would help the corporation get more points next year\u2019s Swachch Bharath ranking. The corporation would take steps to score points on various parameters of Swachch Bharath ranking.",
