Instead of providing protection to the affected people, the police were siding with the caste Hindus , Chinnasamy had complained.\n\nRelatives of Chinnasamy assert that he was drowned in the well. \u201cThere is certainly something fishy about the death since Chinnasamy knew to swim. Moreover, the well had water only to the hip level. How then could Chinnasamy have fallen into the deep well without sustaining any external injury,\u201d a relative said. The body of Chinnasamy is expected to be handed over to family members after second autopsy at the Government Hospital, Coimbatore, on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nDalits in Rice Mill Pudur locality fear that they would be subjected to harassment by the caste Hindus in future. According to Senthamilan, a resident of Rice Mill Pudur colony, the Arundathiyar community also feel intimidated by the police.\n\nThere are about 125 families dependent on employment in fields owned by the dominant caste Hindus .\n\nOrganisations working for Dalit welfare complain that the district administration has not responded appropriately to the incident, as per the provisions of The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules 1995.\n\nRelief\n\n\u201cThe rules mandate the police to provide security to the people and the district magistrate or sub-divisional magistrate to arrange for providing immediate relief in cash or in kind or both to the victims of atrocity, their family members and dependents. The relief includes food, water, clothing, shelter, medical aid, transport facilities and other essential items,\u201d Abirami, National Programme Coordinator of New Delhi-based National Dalit Movement for Justice, said.\n\nAccording to official sources, the situation at Nallampatti was well under control and there was no ground for responding with such measures.\n\nThere are 125 families dependent on employment in fields owned by caste Hindus",
