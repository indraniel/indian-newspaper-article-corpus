    "text": "Farmers in the district have urged political parties to display unity in preventing GAIL from laying underground pipelines across agriculture fields in the Western region of Tamil Nadu.\n\nAt a meeting held in Chennimalai recently, representatives of farmers\u2019 organisations said that the destruction of 600 farm wells, 800 houses, and 24,000 acres in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri, and Krishnagiri, will not be permitted at any cost.\n\nStringent action\n\nThe Union and State Governments must realise that the farmers will not hesitate to even sacrifice their lives to protect their land, said K.V. Ponnaiyan, president of Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers\u2019 Association. The meeting discussed the fallout of the perceived harassment of farmers by banks and the police to recover loans, and called for stringent action against them.\n\nCriminal action must be taken against errant officials, they said.\n\nThe farmers questioned the rationale behind the State Government\u2019s silence despite the 24 sugar mills in Tamil Nadu refusing to settle Rs. 750 crore dues on account of unpaid State advisory price for the last three cutting seasons, and demanded that unhindered three-phase power be supplied for sustaining agriculture activities during the summer.",
