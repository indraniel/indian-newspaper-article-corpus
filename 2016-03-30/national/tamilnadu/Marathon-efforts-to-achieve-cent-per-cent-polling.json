To create awareness among students, an awareness meeting was held in the college.\n\nThe participants agreed to follow the Election Commission guidelines strictly while casting their votes. They were also encouraged to enlighten their relatives and friends not to accept money for casting their votes which was illegal and against democracy.\n\nEfforts were on to include more than 200 inmates in eight aged homes in the district in the electoral rolls.\n\nThe officials would check the voter list and include the names of inmates in the rolls, said Collector N.
