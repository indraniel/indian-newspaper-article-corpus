    "text": "Acquitting the two granite quarry lessees, including PRP Granites, Melur Judicial Magistrate K.V. Mahendra Boopathy pointed out that Mr. Mishra was transferred from Madurai much before the date on which the case was filed. He accused the IAS officer and Special Public Prosecutors R. Sheela and K.C.A.D. Gnanagiri of having cheated him and lied in court.\n\nHe directed his Head Clerk to initiate prosecution against Mr. Mishra under Sections 181, 182, 191 and 199, which related to making false statements on oath, of Indian Penal Code as well as the two SPPs for having reportedly assisted the former Collector in filing the case with \u201cfalse claims,\u201d after obtaining necessary sanction from the State Government.\n\nFurther stating that the allegation of storing granite blocks in private lands levelled against the two lessees under the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Illegal Mining, Transportation, Storage of Minerals and Mineral Dealers Rules, 2011 would attract only a simple punishment of fine of Rs. 25,000 to be imposed by the Collector, the judge said the prosecution was basking under the \u201cfalse glory\u201d of having filed a major case.",
