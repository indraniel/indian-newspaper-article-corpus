Of these, 20,000 pertain to public property.\n\nThe number of complaints has reduced, but defacement of public property continues unabated in many areas.\n\nUsually, many cases of defacement, including setting up of banners, affect pedestrians, motorists and residents on a stretch. \u201cOf the 290 cases of defacement reported on Sunday, 120 involved public buildings,\u201d said an official.\n\nOwing to lack of manpower in each of the 16 constituencies in Chennai district, monitoring political graffiti and banners on footpaths remains a challenge.\n\nThe election office began the work on clearing political graffiti, posters and banners after the model code of conduct of elections came into force on March 4.",
