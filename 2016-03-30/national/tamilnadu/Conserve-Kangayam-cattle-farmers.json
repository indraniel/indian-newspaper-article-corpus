Presently, only around one lakh Kangayam cattle are there\u201d, pointed out K. S. M. Karthikeya, managing trustee of Senaapathy Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation, which is involved in conservation activities for six decades.\n\nV. Sivakumar, an Indian-American who is conserving Kangayam cattle rescued from slaughter at his shelter home here, said that the State Government should market Kangayam cattle milk as a premium product through Aavin and distribution points to be set up across the State which, in turn, would increase the demand for rearing the variety.\n\n\u201cSince Kangayam cattle feed at \u2018Korangadu\u2019\u2014a specific grazing area for the breed that contains 20-odd varieties of shrubs and plants,\u2014the A2 milk produced by the species contains more calcium and lactoferrin, a multi-functional protein that is found in breast milk\u201d, he said\n\nAnother major demand was the need for formulation of a policy to promote supply of value-added products from dung and urine of Kangayam cattle that could be used for organic farming.",
