    "text": "The Congress would get seats from its ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to contest the Assembly elections on the basis of merit and capabilities, and demand a good number of seats, said Shaik Mastan Vali, AICC observer for minorities.\n\nTalking to press persons before taking part in a meeting with minority leaders of the TNCC here on Tuesday, he said Gulam Nabhi Azad had held the first round of talks with the DMK. \u201cWith so many small parties in the alliance, it will take some more time to finalise seats. The party high command will decide on the number of seats. But, we hope the Congress will be offered a good number of seats on the basis of its strength,\u201d he added.\n\nAsaduddin Owaisi of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen was a stooge of the BJP. It was a plan to bring bad name to Muslims. Muslims never said that they would not raise \u2018Bharat Mata ki\u2019 slogan. Several slogans like it were used by the Congress before Independence to unite people, he said.",
