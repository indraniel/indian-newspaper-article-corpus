    "text": "The Chennai Customs Department will soon launch a mobile app for both Android and iPhone users.\n\nPrincipal Commissioner of Customs Ranjan Kumar Routray said, \u201cSocial media is a powerful tool and we want to be active there. We have been holding discussions about the app and hope to launch it soon.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, the Chennai airport also launched an app for passengers. But so far, this is available only on the Android platform. Also the department has been posting updates on a Facebook page it launched sometime ago.\n\nCustoms officials said that passengers could even use this page to post their complaints and action would be initiated.\n\nThey, however, added that there was no plan to have any toll-free number for passengers to register their complaints anytime soon.\n\nThe Commissioner said that as announced in the Union Budget 2016, the duty-free baggage allowance for international passengers had been increased from Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 50,000.\n\n\u201cAlso, earlier, international passengers coming to our country had to fill up forms even if they did not carry dutiable goods. But henceforth, that procedure is not necessary for those travelling without dutiable goods,\u201d he added.",
