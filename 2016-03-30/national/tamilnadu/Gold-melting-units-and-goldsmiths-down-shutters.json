    "text": "After jewellers, members of the Maharashtra Mitra Mandal Trust and Bengali Goldsmith Association began an indefinite strike on Tuesday seeking rollback of excise duty levied on gold ornaments.\n\nThe Trust comprises of gold and silver melting units that are concentrated around Sowcarpet and NSC Bose Road. The Trust\u2019s secretary Praveen Kumar said there are over 5,000 gold-melting units in the area. If the excise duty was levied at the manufacturing level, it would aggravate the problem as they had to maintain accounts for every process.\n\n\u201cWe have already participated in the strike organised by the jewellers association. We have decided to down shutters as such an excise duty would affect our livelihood,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to goldsmiths, each item undergoes 12 different processes from melting, assaying, designing to polishing and finishing. Amjed Ali, president of Bengali Goldsmiths Association said, \u201cMany of them in the trade are illiterate and spend long hours to earn up to Rs.10,000 a month. It is difficult to maintain records as one gold item passes many units before it is ready for sales. We don\u2019t have a choice other than downing shutters again.\u201d\n\nJewellers in the city had recently withdrawn their strike as the Centre had assured them that the process to remit excise duty would be relaxed.\n\nThe associations are now involved in talks to extend support to the indefinite strike by gold manufacturing units.",
