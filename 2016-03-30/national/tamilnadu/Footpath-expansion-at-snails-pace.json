Karunakaran\n\nOf the 471 roads selected for the project, work on only 46 have been completed\n\nGreater Chennai Corporation\u2019s ambitious plan to reclaim footpaths on important arterial roads from encroachment and develop them as per international standards has been making a slow progress.\n\nThe footpath project planned to be executed on 471 roads in several phases seems to have hit a roadblock, thanks to the Model Code of Conduct.\n\nA senior official of the Chennai Corporation giving an update about the footpath development said footpath-widening work had been completed only on 46 roads so far.\n\nFootpath expansion work has been completed on Thiruvanmiyur West Avenue, Besant Nagar 2nd Avenue, 7th Avenue, Conran Smith Road, Ethiraj Salai, Imbrahim Salai, SIDCO Nagar Main Road, Binny Road, Pattulos Road, South Usman Road, Whannels Road, Pantheon Road, Police Commissioner\u2019s Road, Casa Major Road, Greams Road, Anna Nagar Shanthi Colony 4th Avenue, NSC Bose Road, and Tiruvottiyur High Road.\n\nThe official of the civic body pointed out as the pedestrian redesigning work involves various utility agencies in relocating telephone lines, removing pillar boxes and shifting electricity cables and transformers, there were bound to be delays in the completion of the project.\n\nCiting that the footpath improvement project was initiated based on Non-Motorist Transport meeting conducted in 2014, the official said the footpath expansion work had been proceeding as per schedule.\n\nHe said on a few roads like Perambur High Road work was getting delayed due to non-removal of encroachments, which would be taken up once the Assembly elections were over.",
