    "text": "Sisters of accident victim moved court seeking its disbursal\n\nActing on the orders of Additional District Judge, court staff have impounded a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai division) bus as the Corporation had been \u2018dodging\u2019 payment of compensation to three women, who had lost their undergraduate brother in an accident 17 years back involving a TNSTC bus. Passing orders on an execution petition filed by Suseela and her two sisters, Additional District Judge S. Sivakadatcham ordered attachment of the Madurai division bus. Armed with the order, the court staff impounded a bus, when it reached the bus stand here on Tuesday.\n\nAfter Suseela, Thilagavathi and Dhanalakshmi moved the Additional District Court here, seeking compensation, the court in February 2003, directed the TNSTC Madurai division to pay a total compensation of Rs. 75,000 to be equally shared among the three petitioners.\n\nAggrieved over the low amount of compensation, the three filed an appeal in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in 2007 after which, the High Court directed the TNSTC Madurai division to pay a compensation of Rs. 5.26 lakh. As the Corporation failed to honour the court order and continued to \u2018dodge,\u2019 Suseela and her sisters filed an execution petition before the Additional District Court here on July 28, 2015.",
