    "text": "Small traders in the daily textile markets in the city are facing a harsh crisis due to the Election Commission\u2019s restriction on cash possession.\n\nThe election notification came at a time when the business had already declined to 50 to 60 per cent after the festival season. The restriction has brought down the level of transactions to just five to 10 per cent now, M.N. Noor Seth, president of Gani Market Dinasari Aniathi Siru Vyaparigal Sangam, said.\n\nA large section of the small traders who usually come from all over Tamil Nadu and also other States is inclined to make only cash transactions, and a good number of traders even do not know how to use an ATM card, Mr. Noor pointed out.\n\n\u201cThe limit of Rs. 50,000 set by the Election Commission is too low. But, there is scope for the district administration to specify some easy documents that could be produced by traders for possessing money more than the specified amount,\u201d Mr. Noor said, adding that otherwise, the impact being caused by election notification made well in advance will cripple the livelihood of the traders.",
