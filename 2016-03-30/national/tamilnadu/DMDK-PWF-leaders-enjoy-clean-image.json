The State was way behind in development because of the inefficient administration of AIADMK general secretary Jayalalitha and DMK president M. Karunanidhi.\n\nMs.Premalatha alleged that there had been many corruption charges against both the governments. However, none of the DMDK-PWF constituents faced any corruption charge. The leaders had been enjoying clean image since they entered politics.\n\nStating that there was no contradiction among the constituents of the alliance, she said the leaders are clear in their actions. The alliance had been aligning with the people and offered a real alternative to DMK and AIADMK. The people would give a chance to the DMDK- PWF alliance to form a coalition government to provide a corrupt free government, she affirmed.",
