    "text": "The Fisheries Department officials seized 250 kg of fish which was being transported for marketing in the open market instead of marketing through the fishermen cooperative society at Mettur on Monday.\n\nLicence\n\nThe State Fisheries Department has issued licence to more than 2,000 fishermen of Mettur and the surrounding villages of Pannavadi, Keerakaranur and Kottaiyur, all attached to the Mettur Dam Fishermen Cooperative Marketing Society, for fishing in the water spread area in Mettur Dam.\n\nThe Society has been the regulatory authority, which in coordination with the State Department of Fisheries breeds fish in dam water.\n\nIt is mandatory on the part of the licensed fishermen to handover the catch to the Society, which will market the same.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department received complaints in the recent past that the licensed fishermen, instead of handing over the catch to the Society, were themselves marketing the same illegally in the open market. Following this, a team of department officials conducted surprise check in Mettur Masilapalayam area on Monday evening, when it intercepted a fisherman transporting fish stock in two boxes in a two-wheeler.\n\nOn spotting the officials, the miscreant abandoned the two-wheeler along with the boxes and fled the scene. About 250 kg of fish varieties meant for marketing in the open market were found in both the boxes. The officials seized the fish stock and handed it over to the cooperative society.",
