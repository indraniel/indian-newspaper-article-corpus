Ramanathan, organiser T. Punniyamurthy, secretary P. Govindaraj, treasurer P. Arjunan, and others staged the protest. They urged the government to expedite establishment of power co-generation plant. They urged the mills to disburse Rs. 2,850 a tonne as announced by the government for the cane supplied within 15 days of harvest and in one instalment. They wanted the mills and the department concerned to take action against those who indulged in malpractices that led to farmers\u2019 money being siphoned off. They urged the government and the mills to disburse arrears due to farmers from the previous years.\n\nP.R. Pandian, coordinator, Tamil Nadu All Farmers\u2019 Coordination Committee, said the arrears had mounted to Rs. 39 crore in the past three months alone as the government announced Rs. 200 a tonne as hike but did not apportion the required amount to the mills and the due must be paid to the cane growers immediately.",
