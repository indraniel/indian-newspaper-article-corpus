Sivakumar, District curator, Department of Museum said adding this time, the department focused on the theme, \u2018Education with Entertainment\u2019.\n\nThe bus with about 50 windows, showcasing archaeology, numismatics, art, culture, history, heritage, anthropology, botany and geology was a virtual treasure trove for the students as they lined up in batches to take a glimpse.\n\nEach window depicting various events such as Indus-Valley civilisation, Egyptian civilisation, Science and Technology and Arms and Weapons had brief descriptions in both Tamil and English for easy understanding of students. Besides, two staff members of the Department of Museum were deployed to explain the features.\n\nAround 4,000 school and college students visited the bus at four different locations in Paramakudi on Monday and an equal number of students here on Tuesday, Mr. Sivakumar said.
