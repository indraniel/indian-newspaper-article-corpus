Be it central excise, commercial tax, or the social benefits, more activities are going online now.\n\nOfficials organise awareness camps and training programmes and establish help desks to assist those who need assistance to register or upload documents, especially the micro and small-scale units.\n\nInitially, there might be problems. But, gradually the industries start adopting these systems and migrate to it, says an official. Online systems have several advantages \u2013 it avoids delays, brings in transparency, and industries can do the work from their respective premises.\n\nAccording to S. Ravikumar, president of Coimbatore and Tirupur District Tiny and Micro Enterprises Association, entrepreneurs who have knowledge of internet and online tools or the units that have developed to become small-scale enterprises have computer systems and use the online facilities available.\n\nOthers go to browsing centres or use the infrastructure at the industrial associations. But, almost all the micro units will be affected by the Total Solutions Project to be implemented by the Commercial Taxes department from April 1. It is not one time or quarterly or half-yearly filing of documents. It has been done every day and units that have just one lathe or machine will not be able to go online, he says.\n\nThe department should evolve a system that is user-friendly to micro units.\n\nReporting by\n\nM.
