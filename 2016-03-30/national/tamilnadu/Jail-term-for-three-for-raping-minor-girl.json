Saravanan was invited to the girl\u2019s house by a relative to extricate her father from the financial crisis using tantric powers.\n\nWhile staying in the house, Saravanan had developed intimacy with the girl. Holding out promise of marriage, he eloped with the girl taking the help of her relative Muthubava (27), a vegetable trader of B.P. Agraharam, who had invited him and his accomplice Wasim Akram (24), a driver.\n\nThe three youth took the girl to Pudukottai, and from there to Andhra Pradesh, where Saravanan had married her in a Dargah during 2014.\n\nBased on a complaint preferred by the girl\u2019s father, the police arrested them from Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe Mahila Court judge Thirunavakarasu imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 too on all the three.",
