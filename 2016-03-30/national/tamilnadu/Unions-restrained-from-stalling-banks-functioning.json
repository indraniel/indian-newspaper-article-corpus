    "text": "The Madras High Court on Monday passed an interim injunction restraining various trade unions in the IDBI Bank from interfering in the day-to-day activities of the institution till further orders.\n\nJustice K.K. Sasidharan passed the order on a civil suit moved by the bank challenging the strike notice issued by the unions.\n\nAccording to IDBI, there was widespread unrest among the employees of the bank on account of the announcement made by the Union Finance Minister in his recent budget speech, about the changing of share capital of Government of India in the bank, which has been misconstrued by the employees as an attempt to privatise the institution.\n\nLabour Department officials conducted conciliation meetings, which apparently failed. Subsequently, the unions issued a strike notice from March 28 to 31.\n\nApprehending that the unions would obstruct the smooth functioning of the bank, IDBI moved the suit with a plea for interim injunction.",
