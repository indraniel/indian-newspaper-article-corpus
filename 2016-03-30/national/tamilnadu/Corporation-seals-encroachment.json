    "text": "Coimbatore Corporation on Monday sealed an additional construction in a house in Parsn Sesh Nestle on Nanjundapuram Road. Town Planning department officials said that based on a Madras High court order and instructions from their counsel, they went ahead and sealed the 250 sq ft premises that was attached to a house in the gated community.\n\nThe house owner had not taken approval for the construction. The court order clearly said that the corporation should prevent the occupants from using the illegal premises. The corporation had to obey the court order, the officials said and added that if they failed to do so they would invite contempt of court.\n\nThe house owner, S. Sudarshan, said that he had only renovated the house and put up a temporary structure. The court case was filed by a motivated few who had recently lost the residential association election to his team.\n\nNow that the corporation had acted by sealing a structure that it called illegal, it should also act against all illegal structures in the gated complex. He had approached the civic body to do so.\n\nMr. Sudarshan claimed that the corporation\u2019s action was mala fide because the court order only directed the civic body to prevent any further construction and study the issue. He claimed that the civic body had not issued notice to him before sealing the premises.",
