For this, the government machinery need to change its outlook towards agriculture. They have to get into consultation with farmers\u2019 bodies and disseminate the demand potential of every crop both in the domestic and export market in advance,\u201d pointed out C. Nallasami, secretary of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Associations.\n\nK. C. M. Balasubramanian, a retired agriculture economist, too is of the opinion that due to lack of macro planning, many farmers blindly tend to raise a crop which is giving good dividends to some other farmers in the respective regions.\n\nThe farmers across the district will also be demanding the candidates to give an assurance that exact acreage of crops will be carried out in the coming years to get the correct position of the crop yield.",
