    "text": "Conservationists are apprehensive about the impact that could be caused to wildlife due to the proposed widening of the stretch between Sathyamangalam and Mettupalayam, as part of the Erode-Kotagiri road improvement project of the State Highways Department.\n\nThe road passes through Vilamundi reserve forest area in Erode district to a distance of about three km. where there are periodic instances of deer and small reptiles being run over.\n\nThe animals get fatally hit by speeding vehicles while crossing the road between Vilamundi East and West beats in search of food and water.\n\nThe accidents that take place during night hours get noticed only on the next day.\n\nThe reserve forest area is also inhabited by leopards, wild dogs, Indian gaurs and elephants, but the spotted deer get run over since the animals tend stop suddenly due to a momentary shock caused by the brightness of headlights, Forest Department officials said.\n\nWhile the infrastructure projects become inevitable for development, the Highways Department must also be accommodative to some interventions, say conservationists.\n\nSpeed-breakers must be placed at short intervals along the stretch that passes through reserve forest area as has been done in Mudumalai-Gudalur stretch, N. Krishna Kumar, Project Officer, WWF-India, Western Ghats Nilgiris Landscape, said.\n\nThe placement of speed-breakers must be such that the vehicles cannot get beyond 40 km per hour speed, Mr. Krishnakumar said.\n\nForest Department officials hoped that the State Highways will be accommodative to the idea of placing speed-breakers in the reserve forest stretch.",
