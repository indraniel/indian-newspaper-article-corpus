But just recently, she has taken to it and is enjoying weaving \u2014 \u201cI can easily do it,\u201d she said.\n\nShireen is one of the four women, residents of The Banayan\u2019s home in Mogappair, who will soon be trained in hand spinning and hand weaving to make products ranging from table runners to shawls, which can potentially be sold for an income.\n\nOn Tuesday, the organisation that works in the field of mental health, inaugurated 12 looms of four types for 16 of their residents to use.\n\n\u201cThese looms have been modified to allow people with a wide range of disabilities to use them,\u201d explained Archana Padmakar, assistant director at The Banyan. After about three months, she said, a plan to market and sell the products would be devised. \u201cThe weaving will have a therapeutic effect too,\u201d she said.\n\nThe four women are going to be trained at Shuttles and Needles, a centre that promotes hand spinning and weaving as a hobby and craft. \u201cWe already work with seven special schools in Chennai and also supply raw materials to them. The Banyan wants this to be a part of their vocational therapy,\u201d said R. Naresh, managing director.\n\nThe looms were made in New Zealand, and the centre manufactured and supplied yarn that could be used with the looms, he said.\n\nIt is extremely challenging to find a skill to help get people living with mental illnesses get productive employment, said K.V. Kishore Kumar, director of The Banyan. \u201cMany traditional occupations such as pottery, basket and candle making are not very economically viable. But weaving potentially high-end products, where there is scope for innovation and creativity, could be profitable,\u201d he said.\n\n(*Name changed)\n\nShuttles and Needles, which promotes hand spinning as a hobby, will train them",
