    "text": "A section of farmers, and environment activists feel that efforts to clean River Noyyal and other water bodies will not get the desired result unless stringent action was taken to stop pollution caused by effluent discharge and garbage.\n\nAccording to them, irrigation potential of Noyyal as well as many water bodies in Tirupur got affected primarily because of industrial pollution, indiscriminate dumping of wastes, and encroachments that reduced the width of water bodies.\n\n\u201cWhy the authorities continue to allow dyeing units in Tirupur knitwear cluster? We are of the opinion that no such dyeing units should function near a major water body like River Noyyal because the pollution continued unabated despite the Madras High Court order asking the dyeing units to confine to zero liquid discharge norms during dyeing activities,\u201d said C. Nallasami, secretary of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Associations.\n\nThe farmers feel that agriculture should be given more importance than apparel manufacturing. K. Ravindran, president of Nature Society of Tirupur, said that cameras should be placed alongside Noyyal and other water bodies. Speedy action should be initiated against those caught causing pollution, if the water bodies had to be revived.",
