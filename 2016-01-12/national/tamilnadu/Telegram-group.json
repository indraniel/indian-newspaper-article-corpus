    "text": "A telegram group has also been started, and the membership has crossed 350 in just over 48 hours, says Mr. Senthil Raj.\n\n\u201cUnlike whatsapp, the telegram app can be installed in a PC as well and as many as 1,000 members can be added, with each member as the group admin. This way, citizenry could be looped in to participate in civic activities. Five computer assistants have also been appointed to monitor the campaign through Telegram.\u201d\n\nThere are over 69,000 assessed and over 15,000 unassessed households. Soon, Hosur Municipality will issue two bins for waste segregation at source.\n\nThe cleanups will be made a recurring feature every quarterly, on May 1 and October 2, to create a culture of sanitation, adds Mr. Senthil Raj.",
