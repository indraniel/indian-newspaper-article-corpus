This rally focuses on disaster prevention,\u201d he said. Vignesh Yadhav, another student said the government should plan to reduce the damage left behind by natural disaster.\n\nS.Jeeva, said they were ready to shoulder responsibility on creating awareness about environmental issues.\n\n\u201cWe took a pledge not to let anyone encroach on the water bodies or public spaces. The rivers belong to the people. We pledged to do our best to keep them safe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rally was flagged off by actor Karthi.\n\nStudents took a pledge to reclaim the city by protecting the environment.\n\nThey also resolved to judiciously use water, save water bodies, use fewer electronic devices, use public transport, insist on paper bags and carry their own cloth bags, avoid using disposable items, stay away from junk food and plant saplings. Poovulagin Nanbargal along with SBOA schools organised the rally.",
