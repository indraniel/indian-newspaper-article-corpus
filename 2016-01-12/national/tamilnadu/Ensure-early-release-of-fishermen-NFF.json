Jaishankar, Secretary of Ministry of External Affairs, is on an official trip to Sri Lanka to discuss various issues concerning the relationship of both the countries.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Jaishankar, the forum also pointed out that fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are incarcerated and their boats confiscated.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are 114 fishermen languishing in various prisons of Sri Lanka and 75 boats were confiscated. Apart from venturing for fishing to earn their livelihood, they have not committed any criminal act. Their boats are deteriorating since no maintenance was undertaken\u201d, said the forum chairperson M. Elango.\n\nThe forum also requested Mr. Jaishankar to impress upon the Sri Lankan Government to release the fishermen and their boats before the Pongal.\n\nThe forum also expressed hope that the Secretary would be able to announce a proper date for the fourth round of dialogue of the fishermen between both countries after holding discussion with Sri Lankan authorities.\n\nForum urges MEA secretary to impress upon Sri Lankan govt to do it before Pongal",
