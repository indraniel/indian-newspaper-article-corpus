    "text": "He refuses to share dais with folk artistes\n\nMarutham, a Villupuram-based cultural organisation, cancelled a programme by thavil player Valayapatti A.R. Subramaniam after he objected to the display of his picture with players of thappu, a folk percussion instrument.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to honour him on Pongal festival. He agreed to play on the occasion even though I informed him about performance of folk artists. He was furious after seeing the vinyl posters,\u201d said Ravi Karthikeyan of Marutham.\n\nMr. Subramaniam was to share dais with former DMK Minister K. Ponmudi and writer Bharathi Krishnakumar.\n\n\u201cHe was upset that he had to play an auspicious instrument with an instrument (the thappu) played during funeral. I told him that I would cancel his programme. Today I sent him a strongly-worded letter for speaking in derogatory terms about the folk instrument,\u201d said Mr. Ravi Karthikeyan. The issue attracted a lot of buzz on social media and theatre personality Prasanna Ramaswamy said she stopped attending the concerts of a carnatic musician after she refused to perform with folk artists for the Chennai Sangamam festival.",
