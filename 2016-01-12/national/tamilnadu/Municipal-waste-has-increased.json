Biogas plants would produce electricity that can be used by the community and provide employment,\u201d explained a source in the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.\n\nBiogas plant\n\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has proven technology for micro and macro biogas plants and there are several functioning in Chennai.\n\n\u201cA biogas plant that can handle 100 to 200 kg every day costs less than Rs. 5 lakh. It will generate 2.25 kg of methane a day, which is over four LPG cylinders a month. If more people come forward to provide food waste the cost can be reduced,\u201d explained Daniel Chellappa, senior scientist, Technical Coordination Wing at BARC.\n\nSimilarly, large hotels are being asked to implement biogas plants.\n\n\u201cWe have asked them to alter their sewage treatment plants so that the food waste is grounded and mixed with sewage to generate biogas. We have met hoteliers. We are also holding meetings with IT companies to find out if they can implement such projects,\u201d an official said.\n\nCREDAI\u2019s past president N. Nandakumar said nationwide developers were implementing such concepts.\n\nRecyclable wastes too\n\n\u201cNot just food waste but recyclable wastes too are being managed. CREDAI Cochin took the lead with Clean City Movement.\u201d\n\nIn Cochin alone, 800 persons are being employed in the waste management projects. In the long-term it will be beneficial to everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA biogas plant that can handle 100 to 200 kg every day costs less than Rs. 5 lakh. It will generate 2.25 kg of methane a day\u201d",
