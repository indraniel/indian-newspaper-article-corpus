But for Rukshan Munesinghe and Manivannan this dream is to become a part of their travelogue.\n\nThe duo, who began their 11,000-mile road trip from Kuala Lumpur on December 15, in a 1971 Ford Capri headed to Colombo, Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cThis has been a passion of mine for a while now and I was able to restore this car for this journey. And, somehow we managed to find sponsors. Ministry of tourism, Malaysia, was cooperative and encouraging,\u201d says Mr. Rukshan, who runs MY Classic Cars. The vintage car enthusiast is in the business of restoring and selling classic vintage cars, which is a niche business in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate to not see many classics on the Indian roads,\u201d he said.\n\nThe duo, who have great support on social media, post updates of their adventures on \u201cFriendship beyond borders\u201d, a facebook page.\n\n\u201cThis trip has been adventurous and we\u2019ve made several acquaintances along the way. The border security officials in Assam were friendly and when our car ran into some trouble in Imphal, employees at a workshop fixed our gear box for free\u201d, Mr. Manivannan said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to promote peace and friendship,\u201d Mr. Rukshan said. On its last leg, the Ford Capri travelled around Sri Lanka before reaching Colombo.",
