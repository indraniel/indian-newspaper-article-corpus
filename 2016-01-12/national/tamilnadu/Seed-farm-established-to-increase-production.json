Shaiek Abdullah, Assistant Director (AD), Seed Certification, told The Hindu after an inspection of a seed farm at Nambiyan Valasai near here on Monday.\n\n\u201cWith the supply of certified seeds and technical support to the farmers, we could increase the production by 15 to 20 per cent in the coming season,\u201d he said adding presently the yield was 300 to 400 kg of pulses per hectare and this could go up to 500 to 600 kg with quality seeds.\n\n\u201cWe will ultimately achieve the target of 800 kg per hectare,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile encouraging farmers to set up seed farms, the department provided production subsidy of Rs. 15 per kg and certified seed distribution at Rs. 25 per kg under National Agriculture Development Programme and National Food Security Mission (Pulses) respectively, he said.\n\nMr. Abdullah said that the department proposed to procure about 17 tonnes of seeds from the seed farms to be supplied as certified seeds to the farmers.\n\nMore farmers could take up cultivation of short-duration crops, he said adding they were also drought and disease resistant.\n\nAs pulses had nitrogen fixing quality in the roots, the cultivation helped to improve soil fertility, B. Kumaravadivel, AD, Thirupullani block, said.",
