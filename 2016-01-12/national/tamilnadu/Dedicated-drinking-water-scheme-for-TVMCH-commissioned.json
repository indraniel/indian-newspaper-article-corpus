When the matter was taken up with then Palayamkottai MLA and Minister for Sports and Youth Welfare T.P.M. Mohideen Khan, he managed to get sanction for the dedicated drinking water scheme for TVMCH to be executed at the cost of Rs. 6.55 crore after consuming nearly five years.\n\nHaving its infiltration well and pumping station in the Tamirabharani at Manappadaiveedu, this scheme has ensured the supply of 15.42 lakh litres of drinking water to TVMCH a day, including 13.85 lakh litres of water to the hospital and 1.57 lakh litres of water to the college and the hostels.\n\nCollector M. Karunakaran, MP Vijila Sathyananth, Mayor E. Bhuvaneshwari, MLA and alumnus of TVMCH, S. Duraiyappa, Dean, TVMCH and K. Sithy Athiya Munavarah were present.",
