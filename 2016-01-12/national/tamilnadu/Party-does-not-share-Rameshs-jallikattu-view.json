    "text": "All India Congress Committee(AICC) general secretary and former Union Minister of State V.Narayanasamy on Sunday said the former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh\u2019s view opposing the conduct of jallikattu was Mr. Ramesh\u2019s individual opinion and not the Congress party\u2019s view.\n\nMr. Ramesh had sparked a row on Saturday by alluding to the traditional sport as a \u2018barbaric practice\u2019 that, he said, was permitted to appease a few leaders in the State.\n\nMr. Ramesh, who was Union Environment Minister in UPA Government, had expressed a view opposing the conduct of jallikattu . That was his personal view and not the view of Congress party, Mr. Narayanasamy said.\n\nIt is not acceptable for Mr. Ramesh to express a view without knowing tradition of Tamils. \u201cWhen the whole of Tamil Nadu is in favour of jallikattu , people will not accept his remark,\u201d said Mr. Narayanasamy in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is duty of all political parties to protect tradition of Tamils and support the traditional sport as well. We extend full support for the conduct of jallikattu .\u201d\n\nIt was during the tenure of Mr. Ramesh that the Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification banning the use of bulls as performing animals.\n\nIt was this notification that the Supreme Court upheld in 2014.\n\n\u201cIn any case, it was only a small community in southern districts of Tamil Nadu which was agitated by this (ban on jallikattu ). A custom which had relevance at some point of time has quickly degenerated into brutality,\u201d Mr. Ramesh had told a television channel.",
