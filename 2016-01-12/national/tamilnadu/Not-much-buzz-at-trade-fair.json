Ragu\n\nThe sound of work going on along with music on a loudspeaker fills the air at the India Tourist and Industrial Fair being held on Island Grounds.\n\nAn hour before the fair\u2019s inauguration on Monday evening, it seems like hardly anything is ready \u2014 most stalls have not been set up yet and many are empty. Traders said that this year, due to the delay in starting the fair and because of the floods, it may take a while for sales to pick up. \u201cUsually the fair starts in the last week of December. But this year, it was delayed because of the floods. Lots of traders also have not come because they are not sure if sales will be as good,\u201d said a worker at a snack stall, who has been coming to the fair for three years.\n\nAnother trader said that some small stall-owners had also suffered losses in the floods and had not been able to make it.\n\n\u201cOther fairs are taking place and some traders may come later,\u201d he said.\n\nSome were unsure if people would want to spend after losses suffered in the floods, said the representative of India Seashell Museum, which, he said, was participating in the fair for the first time.\n\nEven across the bridge, where the State government stalls are set up, not much has been completed. But there are signs of attractions to come: a mini-train station and a haunted house are two of the many entertainment spots being set up.\n\n\u201cThe rain delayed the fair, but work should be completed in a few days. Public entry will be from Friday onwards,\u201d said a senior police officer attached to the Fort station.\n\nHowever, another trader said that the crowds would come in from Pongal onwards. \u201cThe fair lasts for 70 days. People will start coming in and we may even have more footfall than we had last year,\u201d he said.",
