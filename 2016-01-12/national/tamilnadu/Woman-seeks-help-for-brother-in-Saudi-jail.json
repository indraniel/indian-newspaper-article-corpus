    "text": "A middle-aged woman has appealed to the district administration to help secure the release of her son who had been incarcerated in a jail in Riyadh for the last one-and-a-half years after he was falsely implicated in a case while working for a national of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccompanied by her two daughters and relatives, B. Sivagami from Pazhangottai in Tirupalaikudi presented a petition to Collector K. Nanthakumar here on Monday, requesting him to take up the matter with the State government and facilitate the return of her son.\n\nShe said that her son Viswanathan, who worked in a hotel in Malaysia for five years to educate his two younger sisters, went to Saudi Arabia in March 2013 to earn money to arrange for their marriage. After working in a hotel for two months, he was employed by a Saudi national and within a fortnight he was arrested after police raided his owner\u2019s house and seized some liquor bottles, said Rajalakshmi, his sister, a teacher in a private school.\n\nThough he was convicted for three months after falsely implicated in the case, he continued to remain in the prison till date, she said.\n\nShe said that her brother was in touch with family members and talked to them daily. He had no problems in the prison but remained clueless about his release and return, she said. The family had spent about Rs. 1.50 lakhs to send Mr. Viswanathan to Saudi Arabia through a local agent and virtually lost the sole breadwinner.\n\nAfter he was jailed, his father Balu, a farm worker, had gone to Chennai to take up some odd jobs to help the family, Ms. Sivagami, a school dropout, said.\n\nHe was arrested after police raided his owner\u2019s house and seized liquor bottles",
