Jaffar Sait, who sought to quash the proceedings pending against him over allotment of a Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) plot in his wife\u2019s name in Tiruvanmiyur.\n\nMr. Sait submitted that the DVAC had registered a case against him and his family members among others under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Indian Penal Code, following which he was placed under suspension. The case was registered allegedly on a complaint filed by a former employee of the DVAC.\n\nContending that he had no role in the allotment of the house, the petitioner submitted that in fact his daughter had suffered monetary loss as the TNHB deducted Rs. 14 lakh when she filed a cancellation deed for a plot allotted in her name. The subsequent allotment was made in his wife\u2019s name, for which full payment was made, he claimed. \u201cThe complainant had no locus standi to lodge any criminal complaint with regard to the allotment of the housing plot by the TNHB, which had been done after scrupulously following the due process,\u201d the petitioner submitted.\n\nMatter relates to allotment\n\nof a TNHB\n\nplot in his\n\nwife\u2019s name",
