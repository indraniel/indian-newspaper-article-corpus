Unfortunately, many of them present at late stages, at which point surgery is required and this removes their voice box, leaving the patients unable to speak. Prosthetic devices from abroad cost between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 45,000 and have to be replaced every six months, leaving many people unable to afford them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe device, named the Aum Voice Prosthesis, is about 2.5 cm long and weighs about 25 grams.\n\n\u201cIt is surgically inserted into the patient, and works by transmitting air from the lungs into the food pipe. This allows for sound to be formed. The patient presses his neck to block the air and to push it into the food pipe,\u201d said Dr. Rao, who is a senior consultant with Health Care Global Enterprises, a cancer care network.\n\nDr. Rao had tied up with an industrialist friend, Shashank Mahesh, for manufacturing, he said.\n\n\u201cRight now, we hope to complete the study by the end of March. We have already applied for a patent for this device, and once the study is completed, we are hoping to reach out to regional cancer centres so that a lot of patients can benefit from this,\u201d he said.\n\nM.S. Senthil Kumar, an endocrine surgeon, said the innovation must go through the study, be tested on a sample size of patients and fit into the market.\n\n\u201cBut this is a good step as it is an innovation from our country. More of these would be welcome,\u201d he said.",
