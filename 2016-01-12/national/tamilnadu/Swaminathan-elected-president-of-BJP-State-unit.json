Saminathan, general secretary of the Puducherry unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was declared elected unopposed president of the State unit here on Monday. Mr. Saminathan has replaced M. Visweswaran, a nominated MLA and would be the president for the next three years.\n\nTalking to reporters, Mr. Saminathan said the Union Territory was having bright prospects and its development has been made possible by several progressive measures introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nMy intention is that Puducherry should emerge as a model state. Our goal is to make BJP\u2019s presence in Legislative Assembly and strive hard for bringing BJP rule in the Union Territory, he said.\n\nWe would tone up the organisation in Puducherry from the grassroots level. As many as 75,000 new members have been enrolled in the party so far. The BJP would give adequate opportunities to youth and their potential would be harnessed for the multi-faceted development of the Union Territory.\n\nAsked for the BJP\u2019s political strategy he said that the BJP is already an alliance partner of the ruling AINRC. A delegation from the high command will soon visit Puducherry, he said.",
