    "text": "A total of 44 tribal farmers, who attempted to picket the Collector\u2019s Office here on Monday demanding the execution of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court order to sanction free milch animals to them, courted arrest.\n\nThey were released later in the evening.\n\nThough the Madurai Bench of the High Court had directed the district administration to issue free milch animals under the Tribal Development Programme on or before January 16, 2016, it was yet to be executed, said P. Ramasamy, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Hindu Malayali Scheduled Tribe Farmers Welfare Association, who led the tribal farmers.\n\nHe said that in all 78 farmers from Sengattupatti, Kambur, Thannerpallam, Keezhkarai, Sozhamathi, Puthur, Kundakadi, Karuvankadu, Boothakal, Oduvampatti, Periya Iluppur, Moolakadu and Kinathur on the Pachamalai, in September 2014, had been given sanction letters for milch animals but the Adi Dravidar Welfare Department did not take any step to distribute the animals.\n\nHence the farmers filed a petition. The High Court, in November last year, had given a directive to distribute the animals before January 16.\n\nFarmers assembled in batches in front of the District Collector\u2019s Office and police prevented them at the entrance and arrested them.",
