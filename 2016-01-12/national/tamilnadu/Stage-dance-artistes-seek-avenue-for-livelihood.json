    "text": "Members of Tamil Cinema Stage Dance Artistes Welfare Association approached the district administration seeking police permission for staging entertainment performances.\n\nThey complained that the association members were denied permission by the Police Department for the last five years citing obscenity in the performances. As members of a State-level organisation, none was involved in obscenity in any form, representatives of the association said before submitting a petition to District Collector S. Prabakar.\n\nThere were 1,000 families in the district with a stage dance performer as bread-winner. The Police Department ought to identify and punish miscreants and people who spoiled the name of genuine artistes by indulging in obscenity, they said.\n\nThe association members said the future of their children was at stake due to the hindrances caused to their livelihood.",
