Currently, Koyambedu and Alandur stations see maximum passenger traffic in Chennai Metro Rail with an average of about 3,000 and 5,000 commuters using the stations every day.\n\n\u201cWe are already making arrangements at the Koyambedu station and hopefully it will be launched soon. We want to first see how people are taking to it,\u201d an official said. These eateries would be located at the street-level area of the stations, he added.\n\nEatables are not allowed inside the paid area of the station, which starts after the ticketing area. So, commuters cannot consume food there.\n\n\u201cPeople who want to carry it may do so. But they cannot eat inside the station or on the train. People who violate the rules will first be warned. If they continue to eat at the platforms and on the trains, we will fine them,\u201d an official added. Sources said they had this rule in place to ensure that the stations were not littered.\n\nChennai Metro Rail, being built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, extends to 45 km. In the first phase, the service between Koyambedu and Alandur was launched only six months ago.",
