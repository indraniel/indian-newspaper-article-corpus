Kaul and Justice M. Sathyanarayanan asked for the affidavit from the State government.\n\n\u201cThe affidavit filed today appears to be only an exercise in postponement and nothing more than that,\u201d the court observed. The Bench did not accept the reason given for not filing the minutes of the meeting held on October 19 last year. \u201cThe excuse of the floods is not admissible in this case because the minutes ought to have been drawn on October 19 last year itself and the floods affected Chennai only in December last year,\u201d the Bench said.\n\nThe Bench said, \u201cWe are troubled with the episodes related and recorded in our orders as to how the police handled the situation, as it expressed the helplessness in controlling the situation.\u201d",
