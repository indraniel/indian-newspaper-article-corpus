Four men were arrested in connection with the incident.\n\nAccording to the police, on Monday morning, Jagan alias Jaganathan (52), who is deputy secretary, 140 Division of the DMK, and into real estate business, and his friend Venkatesan were travelling on a two-wheeler on Karunanidhi Street, Old Mambalam Road, when the gang attacked the former.\n\n\u201cAround 8.10 a.m., two men on a bike, one identified as Vinod, shot at Jagan and injured him on the right arm. Soon after this, a few men on four two-wheelers attacked Jagan with sharp weapons and sped away. Venkatesan rushed Jagan to the Government Royapettah Hospital.
