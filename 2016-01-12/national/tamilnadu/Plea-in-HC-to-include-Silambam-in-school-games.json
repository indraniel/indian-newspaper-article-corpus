Sundresh ordered issuing of notice to respondents returnable by four weeks.\n\nIn its plea, the Indian Silambam Federation (ISF) represented by its secretary general S. Kesavan submitted that it was the ISF that was formed first and was eventually recognised by the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu and the State unit of Indian Olympic Association but Amateur Silambam Federation of India has been involved by the National School Games Authority.\n\nThe plea further submitted that the decision would affect the interests of students from Tamil Nadu and hence sought to restrain the event organisers from holding the silambam event as per its rules.",
