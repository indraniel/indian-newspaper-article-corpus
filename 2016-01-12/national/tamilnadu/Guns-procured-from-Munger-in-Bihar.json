    "text": "CHENNAI: Police said most of the gangsters were procuring guns from Munger in Bihar.\n\n\u201cGun-making is a cottage industry there. They can easily make a duplicate of any gun, including AK 47s. One just has to show the firearm to them,\u201d said a senior police officer.\n\nSenior officers said the gun-making industry was active in the region during the British period. \u201cAfter it closed down, its employees started making guns on their own. They began by making the \u2018kattas\u2019 or country guns initially and gradually gained expertise in making sophisticated weapons,\u201d said the officer.\n\nThe guns are then brought to the city in trains.\n\n\u201cDue to lack of proper checking at railways stations and bus termini, the smugglers get down at smaller stations and then deliver the guns by transporting them in buses. However, most often, the bullets fired from these guns only injure a person and do not kill them,\u201d said a police officer.",
