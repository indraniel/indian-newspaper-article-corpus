Following a varnam in Begada, Sanjay focussed on the phrase, \u201cPalumaru Chirakalamu\u201d for Thyagaraja's \u201cTulasi dala\u201d in Mayamalavagoulai. Varadarajan on the violin warmed up to the singer\u2019s improvisations right from the beginning. He then sang the rarely heard Dikshitar kriti in Ananda Bhairavi, \u201cThyagaraja Yoga Vaibavam,\u201d at a slow pace in order to highlight the wordplay of narrowing and widening phrases in its lyrics.\n\nListeners then got to revel in Sanjay's mastery of Mohanam whose notes flowed across the hall, uninterrupted by an unexpected power cut, for Pallavi Gopala Iyer's kriti, beginning \u201cSrirama Ramani.\u201d Harikumar on the mridangam played a tani in his distinctive style and was partnered in his efforts by P. L. Sudhir.\n\nSanjay then dealt in detail with Todi for Marimuthu Pillai's \u201cEnneramum.\u201d Then he delved on Gangeyabhooshani for Thyagaraja's, \u201cEvvare Ramayya.\u201d Darbar lent itself to the singer's stylistic interpretation for ragam and tanam for the pallavi, \u201cSatguru Malaradi.\u201d The final songs included \u201cEththanai Kodi Inbam,\u201d \u201cNeeninaithal\u201d and a tillana in Dwijawanti. As the fiftieth recipient of the Madura Kala Praveena, Sanjay could be counted as among the outstanding contributors to Carnatic music.\n\nRajalakshmi Padmanabhan",
