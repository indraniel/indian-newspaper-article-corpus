Govindarajan, former president, \u2018jallikattu\u2019 organising committee, in Alanganallur, one of the three places renowned for the sport in Madurai, has based his hopes on the caveat filed by the Tamil Nadu government. \u201cThe State government has made a prudent move by filing the caveat, requesting the court that they be given an opportunity to explain before any decision was made. Even if the court provides a week\u2019s time for the government to respond, the Pongal \u2018jallikattu\u2019 will be over before that,\u201d he said.\n\nP. Rajasekaran, president, TN Jallikattu Peravai, said that his organisation was also contemplating about filing another caveat petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.\n\nK.R. Murugan of Veerakula Amarar Iyakkam in Avaniapuram expressed hope that both the Central and State governments, which have showed keen interest in allowing \u2018jallikattu\u2019 this year, would do everything possible to avoid the notification being stayed by the Supreme Court. However, he added that the Centre should also look for a long-term solution to the issue by removing bulls from the list of animals that cannot be exhibited.\n\nMeet convened\n\nMeanwhile, Collector L. Subramanian on Tuesday convened a meeting with the organising committee members of \u2018jallikattu\u2019 in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur to discuss arrangements and issuing instructions to them on adhering to all regulations.\n\nThe Collector told the organising committees that the caution deposit of Rs. 5 lakh hitherto collected by the administration from the committees need not be made this year. Officials said the deposit was collected as per the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009. However, as the Act was not in effect anymore, there was no need to collect the deposit, sources said.",
