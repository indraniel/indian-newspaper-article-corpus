    "text": "The Madras High Court on Monday directed actor Silambarasan alias Simbu to appear before police officers concerned in two stations in Chennai and Coimbatore on or before January 29, in connection with the release of the controversial \u2018Beep\u2019 song online.\n\nWhen the actor\u2019s plea seeking to extend the time for him to appear before the police officers concerned, came up for hearing on Monday, Justice B. Rajendran directed him to appear before the Central Crime Branch, Cyber Crime, Egmore, Chennai and also before the Race Course Police Station in Coimbatore on or before January 29.\n\nThe actor, who was supposed to appear before the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in Chennai on Monday in connection with a case registered for denigrating women in his \u2018Beep\u2019 song instead moved the court seeking extension of time for him to appear.\n\nThe prosecution opposed the plea and stated that the petitioner has not given any reason for seeking extension of time.\n\nThe judge then directed the actor to appear before the two police stations on or before January 29.",
