Residents of its surrounding villages and Konavattam perform pooja and light lamps on the water.- Photo: C. Venkatachalapathy\n\nOne of the biggest tanks in Vellore, the Sadupperi tank, has filled up after more than two decades.\n\nOfficials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said water level reached its full storage capacity of 205 mcft on Saturday night. Villagers in the surrounding areas said the tank is getting filled up after 25 years.\n\n\u201cSadupperi tank is one of the biggest in the district. Its bund length is about 3.2 kilometres. With water level reaching its full storage capacity, this will definitely lead to recharge of ground water level including for Vellore city,\u201d an official said.\n\nA total of 1,586 acres ayacut will benefit from the water in the tank, he said, adding that the tank\u2019s extent was 218 acres. \u201cThere is a nine km supply channel to the tank from Palar at Virinchipuram. We had taken up desilting works as there were obstructions that hindered water flow. Hence, the tank has filled up 45 days after the rains had stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring desilting, garbage that choked the channel was cleared. Surplus water from Malataaru and Agaram Eri flowed into the Palar following the rains in November. \u201cThis water was diverted into the 9-km supply channel that has now filled up the tank,\u201d he added.\n\nThe filled up tank drew several visitors since Sunday. Residents of Sadupperi and its surrounding villages and Konavattam conducted celebrations near the water body.",
