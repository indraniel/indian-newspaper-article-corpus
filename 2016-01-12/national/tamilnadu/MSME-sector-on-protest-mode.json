    "text": "Members of the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector on Monday demanded that the State government act quickly and offer relief to the units affected during the recent floods. The members who went on a protest at Valluvar Kottam said that if financial relief is not provided immediately, their balance sheets would go red and they would have to bring their shutters down.\n\nJayaprakashan, secretary, Consortium of Tamil Nadu Micro Industries Association, said, \u201cSeveral families have been badly affected. Numerous representations have been given to the Union and State governments but in vain.\u201d The workers and proprietors who were present at the protest were worried that they would face challenges in getting fresh orders if they do not deliver on time. \u201cI supply to an auto firm in Chennai. For the last one month I have not opened my unit as all my machines are destroyed. The company has already informed me that they are procuring parts elsewhere and will contact me once I resume operations. If I don\u2019t open my unit in 10 days, I will be in severe crisis,\u201d said Arumugham, a vendor who supplies small parts to auto firms in the Oragadam belt.\n\nMSME sector has put forward several requests to the State and the Centre. It wanted loans up to Rs 10 lakh given without collateral, Sarfaesi act not be invoked to units affected and ESI and PF payments waived for an year.\n\nThe floods wiped out many units at industrial estates in Guindy, Ekkattuthangal, Ambattur, Padi, Thirumudivakkam, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore. More than 14,000 MSME units have suffered losses.\n\nUnits worried that they would not get fresh orders if they do not deliver on time",
