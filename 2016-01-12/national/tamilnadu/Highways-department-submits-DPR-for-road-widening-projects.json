    "text": "The National Highways (NH) wing of State Highways Department has submitted detailed project reports for developing four-lane roads from Karpagam College to Aatchipatty and from Narasimhanaikenpalayam to Mettupalayam.\n\nThe estimates for these projects will be finalised shortly by the department and sent to the Central Government for approval and sanction of funds. These are expected to be taken up on EPC mode (engineering, procurement and construction). The State Highways department will be a facilitator, according to an official of the department.\n\nThe plan is to develop 25-km road (NH 209) from Karpagam College to Aatchipatty into a four-lane one, without land acquisition. The trees on either side of the road will have to be felled.\n\nIn the case of Mettupalayam Road (NH 67), the plan is to improve the road from the flower market in Coimbatore to Mettupalayam for 31 km. Since the stretch from the flower market to Narasimhanaikenpalayam has already been developed into a four-lane road, the proposal is to have a four-lane road from Narasimhanaikenpalayam to Mettupalayam for 21 km and grade separators (small flyovers) at about five places on the entire 31-km stretch, the official said.",
