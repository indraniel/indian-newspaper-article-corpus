Sagayaraj, Verkodu Parish Priest and Chief Coordinator of the Indian pilgrimage for the festival.\n\nThe Jaffna Diocese, which organised the festival, called him up and intimated the date, Fr. Sagayaraj told The Hindu here on Monday. The diocese would send the invitation later this week, after which, he would formally seek permission from the district administration for the pilgrimage, he said. He said that A. Natarajan, Consulate General of India in Jaffna, also called and asked him to begin the preparatory works for the two-day pilgrimage, he said. Last year 4,003 pilgrims from India, including 816 women and 229 children, attended the festival and this year too, they expected more than 4,000 pilgrims, he said.\n\nApplications for the pilgrimage would be issued next week after getting the consent from the district administration, he said. Mechanised boat owners who wished to let their boats for transporting the pilgrims could register at the St. Joseph\u2019s Church in Rameswaram by giving details of the registration numbers.\n\nLast year, the pilgrims were transported in 110 mechanised boats. The pilgrims would leave for Katchatheevu on the morning of February 20 and return after the feast mass, the next day morning, he said. Last year, the festival was held on March 1 and 2, he added.",
