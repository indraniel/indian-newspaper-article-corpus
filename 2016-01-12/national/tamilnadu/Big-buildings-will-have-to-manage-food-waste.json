Residents in apartment complexes will have to segregate waste,\u201d said a source in the Authority.\n\nThe various environmental bodies are also focussing on handling food waste, since it forms 16 per cent of the municipal solid waste and also leads to formation of landfill gas and leachate (any liquid oozing from garbage is called leachate and is a potential pollutant).\n\nIt is formed in landfills when water infiltrates and percolates through waste and dissolves organic and inorganic components.",
