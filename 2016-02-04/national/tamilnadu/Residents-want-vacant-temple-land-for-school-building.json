    "text": "Residents of Oragadam village in Tiruporur taluk have urged the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Board to allot a piece of land lying vacant near a temple for building a new campus for the Government High School.\n\nThe Panchayat Union Middle School in the village that stands on a plot of land that is less than 60 cents was upgraded to a High School in 2007. It also has an elementary school on the premises. While applying for upgradation of the school, residents had suggested that a portion of 20 acres of land belonging to Vaadaamalleeswarar temple could be used for constructing the new campus for the school.\n\nThere were 250 students in the high school and it now lacks sufficient space for setting up a full-fledged science laboratory, computer room and a playground. Meanwhile, enquiries reveal that a sum of Rs.1.60 crore was allotted by the government recently for construction of the school building with necessary facilities. Hence, Oragadam residents appealed to the Collector, R. Gajalakshmi to ensure that one-fourth of the temple land was released by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to enable the construction of new buildings.",
