Suvarna Raju, said, \u201cThe project has managed to steer through the initial headwinds and is now going full throttle. There are plans to weaponise and optimise the aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe HTT-40 project, touted as a symbol of capability to design and manufacture a trainer aircraft within the country, was almost aborted until the Defence Acquisition Council announced in March last year that 68 of them would be bought for the air force.\n\nThe IAF has a total requirement of 181 basic trainers, the rest being filled by importing the Swiss-make Pilatus PC-7 Mark-II. The HTT-40 prototype was recently rolled out of the Aircraft Research & Development Centre\u2019s hangar using a remotely operated mini car. It was witnessed by top officials of HAL, members from flight operations, IAF-Integrated Project Management Team headed by Air Marshal Rajesh Kumar, Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness and Regional Director of Quality Assurance. HAL said the team working on HTT-40 is the youngest on any of its prototype programmes. It will be powered by the Honeywell TPE 331-12B engine and produced at the Aircraft Division, Bengaluru. Seventy of the 90 LRUs, or systems on the trainer, are sourced from the Lucknow, Hyderabad and Korwa divisions of the company.\n\nThe made-in-India aircraft will next undergo ground runs and taxi trials",
