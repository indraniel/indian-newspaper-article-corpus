Siva Saravanan\n\nMembers of Siruthuli and activists on Wednesday caught red-handed a lorry driver who was found letting out sewage in to the Kuniamuthur Canal near Sottaiandi Kuttai on Wednesday. They along with Public Works Department officials lodged a complaint with the Perur Police, who have registered a case and seized the vehicle.\n\nVanitha Mohan, Managing Trustee, Siruthuli, said that when the organisation members went there on Wednesday evening to explore the possibility of removing silt from the canal, they found a lorry driver letting out sewage into the water body.\n\nTheir inquiries then revealed that such illegal pollution of water body had been going on for the past few months. The quantity of sewage let out at the spot also suggested the same.\n\nThe canal carried River Noyyal water to Sottaiandi Kuttai, Ganganarayana Samudram, Perur Big Tank, Kuniamuthur Big Tank and Kuniamuthur Sengulam. And, surplus from the Perur Big Tank reached River Noyyal again.\n\nIf the Canal were polluted, it could potentially pollute the aforementioned water bodies as well.\n\nMs. Mohan and others then informed the PWD officials, who reached the spot and they together alerted the Perur Police. The PWD officials then lodged a complaint with the Police, who have registered a case against driver N. Durai (55) under Section 277 (fouling water of public spring or a reservoir) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe police also seized the lorry.",
