Subsequently, Ramalingam who took over as Budalur Inspector also was allegedly hand-in-glove with the accused.\n\nHowever, Oriental Insurance Company alleged foul play in the case and preferred a complaint with the CB-CID, Chennai, which investigated the incident and filed the charge-sheet.\n\nThe Tiruvaiyaru JM Somasundaram who heard the case found the accused guilty of the offences and handed one year in jail apart from Rs. 500 as fine for tinkering with the general diary and a similar sentence and fine for creating fictitious documents aimed at getting the police official Ravichandran released from the case and ordered that the sentences would run concurrently.",
