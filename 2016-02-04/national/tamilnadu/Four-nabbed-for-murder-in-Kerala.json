Police sources said the murder was committed on January 31 with the victim being Shafiq. The police said that Santhosh had fallen in love with a girl who is said to be a relative of Shafiq. The girl was married to another person after Santhosh went abroad.\n\nWhen Sathosh returned to India, the girl reportedly expressed her desire to live with him to which Shafiq and the girl\u2019s near ones objected.\n\nThis is said to have created antagonism between Shafiq and Santhosh and the former was brutally attacked by a gang in Kadakavoor police station limits on January 31, and killed.\n\nThe video of the brutal attack went viral in the social media and a Kerala police team arrived in Perambalur on Tuesday morning based on information and sought the help of Perambalur police.\n\nPerambalur police secured the four persons and handed them to Kerala police.",
