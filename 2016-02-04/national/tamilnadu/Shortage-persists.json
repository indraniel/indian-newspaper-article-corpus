    "text": "Despite several measures by the RBI and banks, the problem of coin shortage continues in some parts of the city. Some shops and hotels in places such as Anna Nagar and Mylapore offer commission to customers who exchange coins for currency notes.\n\nThe commission varies from Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 for coins worth Rs. 100. Traders say more coin-vending machines are needed in banks. S. Nirmal, a trader in Anna Nagar, visits the RBI premises to get coins at least twice a month.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of Re. 1 and Rs. 2 coins. Whenever I visit banks, I do not get enough coins,\u201d he said.\n\nTraders like S. Ramesh source coins from temples too, apart from customers.",
