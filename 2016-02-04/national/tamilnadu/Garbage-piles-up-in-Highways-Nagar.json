    "text": "The ongoing underground drainage works in Highways Nagar at Suramangalam Zone has not only affected the movement of vehicles, but garbage cleaning has come to a standstill for the past one week.\n\nPresently, the road was dug, chambers being constructed and pipelines laid in the streets in the area. Since road work is in progress, movement of vehicles in the area is very difficult. Over five garbage bins were placed in the road in the area. Since corporation lorries could not enter the road, garbage was not cleared for the past one week and the bins were overflowing.\n\nAlso residents started to dump the garbage around the bins as garbage were found scattered. \u201cEven if lorries could not enter, garbage can be taken in pushcarts to the end of the road and collected in vehicles\u201d, said M. Kumaresan. He wanted the garbage to be cleared at the earliest so that sanitation issues do not arise.\n\nResidents also demanded that the pits be closed and road be re-laid so that commuting is possible. \u201cEven autorickshaws cannot enter the road now due to ongoing works. Roads should be immediately re-laid\u201d, residents said. They added that the road is not only used by the residents but also serve as a link road that connects Suramangalam Main Road and Junction Main Road.",
