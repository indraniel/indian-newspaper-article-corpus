Ashoka Chakkaravarthy, ecologist and assistant professor of Environmental Science, Department of Foundation Courses, St. Joseph\u2019s College has recorded the presence of the Asian Spotted Swallow Tail Moth (\u2018Micronia aculeata\u2019) over a 25-day study period in December and January.\n\n\u201cThere is very little data on this particular species, which makes its detailed study very difficult,\u201d Mr. Chakkaravarthy told The Hindu . \u201cWhile there is a lot of literature on the flora and fauna of the Western Ghats, not much exists on that of the Eastern Ghats,\u201d he said.\n\nMoths are the cousins of butterflies, both of them belonging to the order \u201cLepidoptera\u201d.\n\nThere are approximately 15,000 to 17,000 species of moths in India, active both during day and night.\n\nFound in India, China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan, the Asian Spotted Swallow Tail Moth is mostly white in colour. The adult of this species has speckled pale brown wings with two faint darker sub-marginal bands. Each forewing has a hooked tip. On each hind wing there is a short tail with a black spot.\n\nThe \u2018Uraniidae\u2019 are a family of moths containing four sub-families, 90 general, and roughly 700 species.\n\nMoths constitute an important part of the food chain of insectivores such as bats, some species of owls, lizards, and rodents.\n\n\u201cThe tendency of moths and butterflies to mimic other species can confuse even the experts while identifying the exact insect,\u201d said Mr. Chakkaravarthy, who has been studying them and maintaining photographic evidence for over two years.\n\n\u201cAround a hundred species of the butterflies are on the verge of extinction in India. New and accurate study material on butterflies and moths will be of great use to lepidopterists everywhere,\u201d he added.",
