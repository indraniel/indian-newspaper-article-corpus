Ganesan\n\nPotholes and overflow of sewage are causing much trouble to residents and motorists on North Boag Road and Dr. Narasimhan Road in T. Nagar.\n\nFor most part of the day, there is a pile-up of vehicles around one particular spot on Dr. Narashiman Road.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s floods, a manhole had collapsed, resulting in overflow of sewage and this problem is yet to be solved.\n\nResidents here said the road had been in state of disrepair for months and that it worsened after the manhole collapsed. \u201cOver the last month, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board staff have visited the spot, pumped out excess water and levelled the area around the manhole.\n\nBut the problem of sewage overflow persists,\u201d said Manikandan, manager of an Ayurvedic store on Dr. Narasimhan Road, opposite the spot.\n\nFor Alagappan and Sozhi, who own a mobile ironing cart, the stench of the sewage overflow forced them to shift to different locations on the same stretch every day.\n\nIt is a risk for students of Anjuman School too. \u201cOur school gate is situated very close to the manhole. I am forced to cycle on the pavement to avoid accidents,\u201d said Adeep, a class XII student.\n\nMetrowater officials said they had immediately barricaded the area around the manhole after it collapsed. \u201cWe will solve the problem completely in a few days,\u201d officials said.\n\nA Chennai Corporation official said that road-laying work on the 850-metre stretch of North Boag Road and Dr. Narashiman Road had already begun and that it would be finished soon.",
