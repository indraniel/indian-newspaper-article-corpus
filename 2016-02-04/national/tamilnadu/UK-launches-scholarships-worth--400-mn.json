Over 1,50,000 of them are Indians. I hope students and parents will use the one-day exhibition to meet the U.K. universities and find out more about the opportunities which are suited to them,\u201d said Mei Kwei Barker, director South India, British Council India.\n\nOver the past few years, the officials have identified over 90 colleges in the UK that are allegedly functioning illegally.
