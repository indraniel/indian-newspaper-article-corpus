    "text": "Contract labourers attached to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) LPG bottling plant at Manali are demanding that they be allowed to resume work.\n\nThe workers had resorted to a go-slow agitation several weeks ago demanding among others, incentive for increased production. However, talks with the Labour Commissioner did not fructify and IOCL is awaiting intervention from the State government, said sources in IOCL.\n\n\u201cTheir contract is yet to get over and now, they are making new demands,\u201d sources said. This has led to increase in backlog of LPG cylinders to the city. At present, consumers complain that it takes them 15-20 days to get refills.\n\nK. Ravi of AITUC Athipet branch, which is dealing with the issue on behalf of workers, said the labourers had increased production after they were promised an incentive. \u201cLoading and unloading cylinders is hard work. The incentive works out to Rs. 100\u2013Rs. 200 a day per person. Workers have been on contract for the past 16 years and need to be made permanent. Most of them are Dalits,\u201d he said. Workers hope the government will help them.",
