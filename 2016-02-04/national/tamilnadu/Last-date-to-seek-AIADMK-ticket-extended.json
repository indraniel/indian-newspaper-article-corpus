Look at the age profile of MLAs and MPs there are many first-timers too. She wants us to serve the people and has been asking seniors to take party responsibilities so that they can offer suggestions and guidance,\u201d said an advocate and hopeful who bought his application on Wednesday.\n\nIn the run up to the elections since many people might quit their parties and join others, every party has a system in place to decide on eligibility for tickets.\n\nIf they join the party beyond the date till applications are accepted, the executive committee is convened to take a decision.",
