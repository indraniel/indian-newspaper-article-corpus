New products continued to hit the market. Indian researchers were capable of designing their own innovative products.\n\nThe country had excellent manpower to develop efficient products. There were many avenues to explore the possibilities of making a mark. Hence, the researchers should work individually or collectively to design powerful products.\n\nCiting India\u2019s success in space research, Prof. Agnihotri said the country had crossed several milestones by utilising indigenous technologies at various levels.\n\nIt had overtaken many leading and developed countries in space research. The same could be achieved in designing innovative products in information technology too.\n\nV.M. Muthukumar, Vice-Chancellor, Bharathidasan University, who inaugurated the seminar, asked the students to create awareness on the importance of using modern technologies for constructive purpose.",
