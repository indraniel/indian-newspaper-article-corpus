    "text": "The State Government should appeal in Supreme Court on its GAIL order if the interests of the farmers were to be protected, said R. Mutharasan, State Secretary, Communist Party of India, here on Wednesday.\n\nIn a brief meeting with the press, Mr. Mutharsan also took a dig at the Pattali Makkal Katchi\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss\u2019 declaration that his first signature as the Chief Minister, if his party came to power would be to enforce prohibition.\n\n]\u201cSince the PMK leader was already embroiled in corruption charges because of attesting his signature, where it was not needed, he must first relieve himself from the corruption allegations before contesting in elections,\u201d Mr.Mutharasan said.\n\nOn the prospects of the Makkal Nala Kootani, the CPI leader alleged that there were attempts to derail the alliance, but such attempts will not succeed.\n\nThe CPI leader was here meeting the cadres ahead of the AITUC conference in Coimbatore in the third week of February.",
