    "text": "Massive efforts are on to administer preventive medicine to chickens in order to control white diarrhoea.\n\nV. Rajendran, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, said that besides regular monitoring, two special camps would be held in the district on February 9 and 22 to cover all birds. Talking to media persons here on Wednesday, he said that veterinary doctors would visit villages on the two days to administer medicine to the chickens. About 1.40 lakh vaccines were brought from Chennai for this purpose, he added.\n\nWhite diarrhoea would cause much damage to chicken, thereby leading to huge loss to farmers. The disease might wipe out 50 per cent of the bird population in any centre instantly. Survival of the affected chickens was very remote, he noted.\n\nTo protect the birds from the disease, preventive medicines were being administered to them on Saturdays too.\n\nWith growing demand for country chickens and prospects of better returns, several farmers shifted to country chicken breeding from broiler chicken breeding. Moreover, investment for country chicken breeding was less, he added.",
