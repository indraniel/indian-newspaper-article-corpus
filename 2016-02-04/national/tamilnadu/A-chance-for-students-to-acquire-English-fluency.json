    "text": "From now on, students of government high and higher secondary schools at several villages around Gandhigram will have an opportunity to improve English speaking skills with the help of language teachers in the US as Gandhigram Trust, in association with eBay Foundation and Silicon Valley Community Foundation, launched a computer literacy and communication skill development project on Wednesday. To implement the project, the trust has invested Rs. 6.6 lakh for installing electronic equipment, including computers, colour monitors, printers, an LCD projector and a display screen, and other necessary infrastructure to enable students to attend online courses from the US at its children\u2019s home, Sowbagya Illam.\n\nTwo instructors were also appointed at the centre to take offline courses to the inmates.\n\nK. Siva Kumar, trust secretary, said that computer literacy was very essential for education and enhancing skills of the students. Initially, the centre would impart technical skills to the students at the home. They would be trained in MS Office, Excel Sheet and Photoshop. It would be a week-end course. \u201cAfter promoting soft skills, we have planned to impart training in hardware to these students in the next phase. These students would become employable after completing schooling. They can opt for higher education or go for job immediately. This is part of our Integrated Child Protection Scheme,\u201d said Mr. Siva Kumar. These students would also take part in communication skill classes. Language teachers in the US would take classes online to these children during weekends to enhance communication skills, he added.",
