Ravikala said that the hospital delivery had been improved in the district, resulting in slump in mother-infant mortality rate.\n\nMore than 6,000 persons living with HIV positive, including 70 children, were under treatment at Dindigul GH through ART centre. A district-level coordinator, a HIV affected person, had been coordinating and motivating other HIV persons. He gave counselling and legal aid to women with HIV, she added.\n\nDr. Ravikala appealed to the undersecretaries to take up the issue of transgenders and chalk out plan for their livelihood activities in order to prevent them from becoming sex workers and beggars. At present, their condition was pathetic as none gave them any job, she deplored.\n\nThe team collected data on the total number of beneficiaries through various Central schemes and inspected wards, ART centre and blood bank in the GH.\n\nSeveral Central teams have been touring the State since February 2 conducting field study of Central government schemes.",
