    "text": "A business team from Japan that is in the field of production and sale of banana paper (paper made of banana fibre) visited the weavers of Anakaputhur on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to them, E. Satoko, CEO of One Planet Caf\u00e9, a paper manufacturing company from Tokyo, said they had set up their factory in Zambia with 25 women for extracting fibre from banana stem to make paper. These weavers could contribute to similar projects in India to improve paper manufacturing and textile weaving. Company director Peo Ekberg said Japan and India had great technology in harmony with nature, goods, services and people.\n\n\u201cWe are working on a technology-transfer programme with environmentalists in Bangladesh and willing to share our knowledge with anyone who provides sustainable business promotion for weaving,\u201d Anakaputhur weavers told the delegation.\n\nBanana fibre is extracted through a manual process, where the stem sheaths are scraped and fibre is separated using a metal scrapper. In this manner, just about 500 gm can be extracted. Alternatively, a mechanical process yields 10 times the quantity but with heavy damage to the fibre, they said.",
