They also stressed the need to expedite land acquisition and expand Coimbatore International Airport.\n\nThe Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, sought opportunity for industrial associations to participate in the Smart City project, especially because Coimbatore is one of the cities listed in the top 20. The association representatives also explained the efforts of Siruthuli in conservation of water bodies.\n\nAccording to Indian Texpreneurs\u2019 Federation, the Union Government should organise a textile fair as done in some of the European countries. They also submitted their requests on how Make in India can benefit the textile sector and measures needed to boost exports. The industry has manufacturing capacity and to make use of it, there should be a theme to get global attention. This will benefit small manufacturers too and even buyers from new countries can take part. Further, given the importance of cotton in the Indian textile sector, the association members highlighted the potential to increase cotton yield.",
