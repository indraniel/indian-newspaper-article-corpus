The efficacy of the carbon produced here had been tested and it has been ascertained that the powder contained 42 per cent carbon.\n\n\u201cThe minimum requirement of carbon in fields short of carbon is just 25 per cent,\u201d says R. Rajasekar, Municipal Chairman.\n\nThe Director of Municipal Administration, G.
