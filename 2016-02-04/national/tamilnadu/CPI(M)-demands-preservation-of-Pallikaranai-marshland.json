Ramakrishnan alleged that neglect by successive State governments had shrunk the size of the precious freshwater swamp and environment protection had taken a severe beating. The party would continue their stir to save this marshland, which should be one of the biggest bird sanctuaries, he said.\n\nThe party said the Perungudi dump yard had to be removed from the marshland. Leachate (water percolating from a solid material) from tonnes of accumulated waste polluted the groundwater for almost three decades now and residents of Sai Nagar, Telephone Nagar and MC Nagar had been getting water unfit for consumption, they said.\n\nLack of underground drainage was another problem the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government had to address the voters of Sholinganallur constituency, formed during realignment of constituencies in 2011, they said. Maduravoyal MLA, G. Beem Rao, and south Chennai district secretary A. Bakiyam spoke on the issue.",
