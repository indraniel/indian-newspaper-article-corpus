    "text": "The project will adversely affect lands of 1,500 farmers: Dr. Anbumani\n\nPattali Makkal Katchi\u2019s Chief Ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss has faulted the State government for its \u201cfailure in proper presentation\u201d of the adverse impact on farm land in western region in the GAIL underground pipeline project case in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe lackadaisical approach of the State government has led to the Supreme Court giving its nod to the project that would affect over 1,500 farmers in the western region,\u201d Dr. Anbumani told reporters here on Wednesday.\n\nStating that the pipeline could be taken through Kerala to Karnataka, he said even otherwise it could be laid along the national highways without affecting farm land. \u201cThe only issue is that it would incur additional expenditure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project that aimed to take the pipeline through districts in the western region, including Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur, Salem, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri, will adversely affect farm lands of 1,500 farmers, he said. Besides, it also faced the prospect of causing environmental problem, he said pointing to a fire accident that occurred in Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\u201cStill, the Centre can scrap the alignment,\u201d he said. The Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, should take up the issue with the Prime Minister, he said.\n\nStating that the Sagayam Committee, in its granite-mining related report, had said that the State exchequer had incurred huge loss in illegal granite quarrying in Madurai district, Dr. Anbumani wondered why the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president, M. Karunanidhi, and its treasurer M.K. Stalin were silent on the issue.\n\nDr. Anbumani also blamed the State government for its failure in bringing AIIMS-like multi-speciality hospital at Thoppur for which he (Dr. Anbumani) had laid foundation stone in the past when he was the Union Health Minister.\n\nProject shelved\n\n\u201cThe Centre had allocated Rs. 150-crore in the first phase. The plan was to construct a most modern hospital like AIIMS in New Delhi at a cost of around Rs. 1,000 crore that would have benefited the people of south Tamil Nadu. But after the change of guard in the State, the project had been put on the backburner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe construction of a new building near Government Rajaji hospital, was not adequate for such a huge health-care facility proposed in the past, he said.",
