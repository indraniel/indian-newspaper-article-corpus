The high diurnal temperature would not be favourable for poultry as it would reduce the feed intake.\n\nEgg production and egg weight would also decline slightly as farmers had been asked to reduce energy content of feed by 50 kcal per kg to 2,500 kcal per kg feed.\n\nStress\n\nThe release said that rising day-time temperature may induce mild stress in poultry and hence farmers were asked to use stress alleviating medicines.\n\nA press release from Agro Unit of Krishi Vigyan Kendra here said that soil health was likely to be affected by poor irrigation adoption methods which would affect plant growth drastically.\n\nHence, farmers were asked to test the water quality in bore wells.
