Balamurugan.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Mr. Balamurugan also said that passport applicants can now choose their appointment time on five working days and don\u2019t have to come to the three Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) in the city on a fixed date and time like earlier.\n\n\u201cAll these are part of Government Process Re-engineering of e-governance, which is aimed at reducing the process in issuing passports to applicants. Since the Aadhar database with 96 crore citizens have been integrated with passport database, it has become possible to get passport within three to five days,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to integrate data from Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) of the State with passport database was in the pipeline, he said, adding Permanent Account Number (PAN) database would also to be integrated with that of passport.
