    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Puthiya Thalainagar Makkal Iyakkam, an organisation pressing for the development of a new capital city for the State, has planned to meet leaders of various political parties to enlist their support for their demand.\n\nAddressing a press conference here on Tuesday, V.Jawahar Arumugam, general secretary, and M.Sekaran, president of the organisation, said they were planning to meet political leaders to seek support for developing a new capital and including the same in their election manifestos.\n\nEmphasising the need for developing a new capital, they said that Chennai has been prone to natural disasters. Besides, the city had become heavily congested given the population growth leading to problems on various fronts such as traffic, health and sanitation. The concentration of government offices in Chennai has caused difficulties in accessibility for people of far off districts. It was essential to have the Secretariat at a central location of the state to help equitable industrial and economic development, they contended.",
