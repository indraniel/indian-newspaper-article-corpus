    "text": "A Division Bench of the Madras High Court Bench here has set aside an order passed by a single judge on December 2 directing Dindigul Corporation Commissioner to appoint a group of 25 people as sanitary workers on compassionate grounds, and not to outsource the work of sanitation, while allowing a writ petition filed by an applicant for the job.\n\nDisposing of a writ appeal filed by the Commissioner, a Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran said that the writ petitioner, M. Lakshmi, should have confined her plea to her own appointment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, she asked for appointment on compassionate grounds for 24 other applicants too. This is a mistake that she committed.\n\n\u201cThe learned judge went a step further and directed the Corporation not to outsource the job to third party contractors which was not even the prayer made in the writ petition. Therefore, we are of the view that the order directing the appointment on compassionate grounds to persons other than the petitioner and the direction to not outsource could not have been granted,\u201d they added.\n\nWithin four weeks\n\nNevertheless, since the Corporation had already decided to appoint the petitioner as a sanitary worker on compassionate grounds following her mother\u2019s death in 2010, the judges directed the Commissioner to issue necessary orders within four weeks.\n\nThey also gave liberty to the other 24 applicants for the job to file individual writ petitions seeking employment on similar grounds.",
