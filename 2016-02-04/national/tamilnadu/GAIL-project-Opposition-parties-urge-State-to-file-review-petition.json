    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi and DMDK president Vijayakant on Wednesday asked the State government to file a petition in the Supreme Court seeking review of its order granting permission to GAIL to lay pipelines along farmlands.\n\nIn a statement, the DMK president said the SC order has shocked farmers and political parties here. The State could either file a review petition or find an amicable settlement to the issue through negotiations with all the stakeholders.\n\nThe DMK was not objecting the GAIL pipeline project but only insisting that the pipelines should not affect farmlands.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi also recalled a DMK executive committee resolution on April 4, 2013 which sought pipelines along the highways and railway lines as it has laid in Kerala and Karnataka without affecting farmlands.\n\nMr. Vijayakant, in a statement, also asked GAIL to take up the project along highways and rail tracks. The State government should have objected to the project at the time of drafting itself, he said.\n\nAs the project would endanger the livelihood of farmers, the State government should constitute a panel of legal experts and file a review petition immediately and obtain a stay to prevent GAIL from laying pipelines along farmlands, he said.\n\nTalking to reporters here, CPI (M) State secretary G. Ramakrishnan also insisted on the State filing a review petition.",
