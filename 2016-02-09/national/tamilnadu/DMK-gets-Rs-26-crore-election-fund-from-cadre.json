Karunanidhi said that the partymen have been filing applications to contest in the forthcoming Assembly elections and the party headquarters has been furnishing him with the data on the number of applications received everyday.\n\nBesides, at least a hundred partymen were personally visiting him with families and giving Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000 as election funding. Till now, the party has received Rs 26.84 crore. This (news) made him forget the pain in his left eye which was injured way back in 1953 during a car accident and on which multiple surgeries have been performed over the years, Mr. Karunanidhi said.\n\nHe, however, reminded them that though many could have filed nominations for each ticket the party could select only one to contest. Besides, some constituencies would have to be given to the allies. In such cases, the party has already announced that deposits would be returned.\n\nThe DMK president requested partymen also to work untiringly towards victory in the elections.\n\nThe DMK had started receiving applications from aspirants from January 24. The last date for filing applications is February 10.",
