    "text": "The Election Commission has decided to release the names of deceased voters to recognised political parties before issuing copies of electoral rolls to candidates who will contest in the eleven Assembly constituencies in Kancheepuram District.\n\nDisclosing this at an all-party meeting held on Monday, the District Election Officer and Collector, R. Gajalakshmi said only 1,195 applications for deleting names had been received during the two special electoral roll revision camps held in 11 Assembly segments in the Kancheepuram District recently.\n\nThese forms would be verified and before taking the final call, the list of names to be marked as deleted would be served to recognised political parties for cross verification by them.\n\nThe objective of this exercise was to ensure transparency in the preparation of the rolls to be used in the elections, she pointed out.\n\nParticipating in the meeting, Kancheepuram MLA V.Somasundaram of AIADMK urged the Collector to ensure that door-to-door verification is taken up by the officials.\n\nC.V.M.P. Ezhilarasan of DMK raised concerns over a steep increase in the number of new voters in Tambaram. Responding to this, the Collector said it might be due to the increase in new residential colonies.\n\nResponding to the allegation of \u2018bogus voters\u2019 raised by political parties, Ms. Gajalakshmi said people should not jump to conclusions as the voters might have shifted residence within the same constituency.",
