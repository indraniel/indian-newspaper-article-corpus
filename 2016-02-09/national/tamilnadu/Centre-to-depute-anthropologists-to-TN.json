He said that under the Constitution of India, the process of changing the nomenclature of the community required enactment of a legislation.\n\n\u201cBut, we will do what no government has done in the last 68 years,\u201d he added.\n\nTrust founder president M. Thangaraj said that the demand was to change the nomenclature for people belonging to Kudumban, Pannadi, Kaladi, Kadayan, Devendrakulathan, Pallan and Vadhiriyan communities. \u201cThe change of name is not going to make any change in the Scheduled Caste status of these communities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe signatures were collected from people from 1,450 villages in 80 Assembly constituencies in 19 districts, he added.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Prof. R. Srinivasan of Sastra University said that the question was not whether the Scheduled Castes people would support the BJP. \u201cBut, the fact is that the BJP is supporting these people,\u201d he said.",
