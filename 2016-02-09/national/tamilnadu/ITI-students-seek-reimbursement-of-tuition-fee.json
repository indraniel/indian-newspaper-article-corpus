Kulandaivel on Monday seeking reimbursement of their tuition fee.\n\nThey said reimbursement of tuition fee for the ITI students, which had been in practice since July 2012 following a Government Order, had been stopped to them since 2015 without any prior intimation to leave the studies of a few hundred students in the lurch.\n\nHence, the tuition fee, usually being disbursed through the Department of Employment and Training, should be reimbursed to them, they prayed.\n\nAnother group of students from a private engineering college at Cheranmahadevi submitted a petition seeking the revival of a suspended bus service via their college.",
