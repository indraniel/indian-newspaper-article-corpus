    "text": "Three members of a family from Kumarapalayam village in Sanarpatti union threatened to douse themselves with kerosene and commit suicide on the Collectorate premises here on Monday.\n\nThe police seized the kerosene and arranged a meeting with Collector T.N. Hariharan. S. Radhakrishan, his wife Muthulakshmi, and son Harikrishan, complained that the bigwigs had been forcing five families to leave the village after abandoning their own houses immediately. \u201cFive houses, including ours, block entry to large tracts of poromboke land. The bigwigs plan to encroach it. They often attack our houses and two-wheelers,\u201d he alleged.\n\nWhen male members left for work, the gang threatened the women at home. They also threw household articles into the well, he charged. \u201cI lodged a complaint with the police. But no action has been taken. After repeated appeals, Superintendant of Police A. Saravanan directed the Sanarpatti police to file an FIR. Later, the police registered a case. But the atrocities against us have increased after the FIR was filed,\u201d Mr. Radhakrishnan said. The Collector assured to take action against the village bigwigs.",
