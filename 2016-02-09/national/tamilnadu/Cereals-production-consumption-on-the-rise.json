Thenoon-meal programme in schools also did not include the nutri-millets, he said.\n\n\u201cI got millets included in the National Food Security Act of 2013, so that there will be both the minimum support price and public procurement. This will help to widen the food basket and insulate farmers from a failure of crops under conditions of low rainfall and moisture stress,\u201d Mr. Swaminathan said.\n\nMillet farmer and organics promoter Pamayan of Madurai suggested that the government consider supplying coarse cereals through the PDS in cities where awareness levels are higher.",
