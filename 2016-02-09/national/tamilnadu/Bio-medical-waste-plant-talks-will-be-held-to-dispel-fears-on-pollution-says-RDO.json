Saravanamurthy told The Hindu that talks would be held with farmers and people promoting the bio-medical treatment facility, which is coming up at Suryanallur to dispel any fears on pollution.\n\n\u201cWe are planning the talks as a section of farmers have raised concerns that the facility, if becomes operational, could cause pollution and health hazards to the people in locality and affect the prowess of farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHowever, the official clarified that there was no direction given till now to stop the construction of the facility, which is progressing. Clarification came close on the heels of the allegations by farmers that the district administration, some days back, gave an assurance to stop the construction immediately.\n\n\u201cWhen we pointed out that the ash disposal from the unit into earth could threaten the agriculture, the district administration told us that the construction will be stopped. However, it has not happened\u201d, pointed out A. Kalimuthu, one of the farmer-activist in the area. The farmers again petitioned Collector and other officials on Monday expressing their displeasure over the continuing of construction works. Official sources added that the works could not be stopped all of a sudden as the project promoters comprising doctors, had obtained the establishment consent from requisite bodies. \u201cThe consent to operate will be given only when it was ascertained that the plant confirms to all pollution control norms\u201d, sources said.",
