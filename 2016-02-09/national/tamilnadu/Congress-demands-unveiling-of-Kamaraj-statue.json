Recently, both the parties decided to withdrew the case in the court.\n\nHowever, people unveiled the statue which was later covered by the police.\n\nThe police said that since a case was pending in the court, unveiling the statue would not be permitted.\n\nLater, both the parties withdrew the case.\n\nOn Monday, S.B. Meganathan, president, Salem Urban District Congress Committee, came to the Collectorate to submit petition to the Collector.",
