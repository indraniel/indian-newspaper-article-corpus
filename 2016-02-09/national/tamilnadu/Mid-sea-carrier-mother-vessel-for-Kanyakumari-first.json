The mother vessel would operate in about 50-100 nautical miles from Kanyakumari shore.\n\nAfter the tender process, the operator would deploy a minimum of two fish carrier vessels for two years initially after obtaining licence from Mercantile Marine Department.\n\nThe vessels are expected to collect food and water from the respective fishermen\u2019s representative at shore and deliver at sea, supply ice and collect the catch.",
