    "text": "The action of the private organisation, which has been allotted the work of cleaning the garbage during the peak hours even in the busy localities and thoroughfares, has come in for sharp criticism. The vehicle transporting the garbage could be seen moving on the main thoroughfares and halting at the busy junctions to lift the garbage.\n\nThis causes much hardship to the public, and people running business in the respective localities. Besides, this also leads to frequent traffic bottlenecks. Moreover, on many occasions these vehicles overflow due to which the garbage could be found strewn all along the roads.\n\nThe residents say that the Corporation should take a cue from the garbage management programme adopted in the Union Territory of Puducherry. The garbage is cleared by the local bodies in Puducherry and Karaikal much before the break of dawn.\n\nThis makes the roads and streets look neat and tidy.",
