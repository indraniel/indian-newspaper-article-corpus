Stalin for his role in the coal-bed methane extraction issue, PWF coordinator and MDMK general secretary Vaiko said here on Monday.\n\nIn a scathing attack on the Dravidian foes at the PWF campaign rally here, Mr. Vaiko accused the AIADMK and the DMK of encouraging corruption in river sand extraction, granite quarrying, and liquor trade. If the trend continued, then Tamil Nadu would be ruined, he said. He urged the electorate to vote the PWF to power for ensuring corruption-free and transparent administration that would strive to conserve the livelihood resources of the people.\n\nMaintaining that it was Mr. Stalin who initiated the pact to allow coal-bed methane extraction project that had the potency to ravage the fertile fields and water resources in the lush delta region of the State, Mr. Vaiko said a probe would be launched into the methane project issue and in particular the role of Mr. Stalin in the methane project and follow up action would be taken. He cautioned TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan against alleging that the PWF was supporting somebody and refuted any such possibility.\n\nViduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol.
