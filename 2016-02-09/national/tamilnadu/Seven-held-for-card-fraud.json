    "text": "The Central Crime Branch (CCB) wing of Chennai City Police has arrested seven men for allegedly cheating many people in the city of several lakhs of rupees in cases of online and credit/debit card fraud.\n\nCCB policemen said that based on complaints from people about money being withdrawn from their bank accounts without their knowledge through their credit and debit cards, a Bank Fraud unit launched an investigation. It was established that the prime suspect was from Karnal district in Haryana. Nitin Singla (26) and his accomplices are reported to have collected customer data from online and communication network companies, investigating policemen said.\n\nThe suspects managed to get details of the customers and their cards including date of birth, CVV/PIN numbers, credit/debit card numbers, expiry date and even OTP from them under the pretext of calling from the bank\u2019s customer care office. On getting the personal and card details, the gang made payments to mobile phone and online payment companies, policemen said.\n\nNitin\u2019s accomplices, who were arrested, include V. Vikas (27), M. Riasath Khan (36), K. Gulshan Kumar 24), H. Jitinder (30), R. Shamanram (24) and B. Krishnan Chawla (55).\n\nThe CCB is searching for Vipin Chopra, working as business executive of a mobile phone company, for reportedly parting with data of the victims. Police said Singla runs a mobile phone distribution company and also a telemarketing company through which the bank fraud was executed.\n\nThe seven arrested persons were brought to Chennai after producing them before Karnal Chief Judicial Magistrate Sector 12.\n\nThe accused will be produced before the Alandur Judicial Magistrate on Monday.",
