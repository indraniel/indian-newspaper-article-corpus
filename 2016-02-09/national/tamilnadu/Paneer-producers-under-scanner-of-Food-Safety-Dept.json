A soft texture is possible only if it has more than 50 per cent fat content. But, the few units at Solar and Mamarathupalayam where the Food Safety officials conducted the checks had seemingly used skimmed milk and more than accepted level of acid content in the manufacture process. \u201cThe samples have been taken for testing,\u201d G. Karunanidhi, District Officer for Food Safety and Drug Administration, said.\n\nIt is difficult for the public to make out if paneer is made out of whole or skimmed milk.\n\nThe results are best only when whole milk is used. Use of non-fat milk will make the paneer hard, Food Safety officials explained.\n\nAccording to sources, the tests will also determine presence of starch, which is used for giving paneer rich texture, but could lead to digestive problems.\n\nIf the paneer has marble white colour, sweetish, mildly acidic taste, spongy body and closely knit, smooth texture, it would have been made with whole milk.\n\nMoisture\n\nBureau of Indian Standards (BIS 1983) imposed maximum of 60 per cent moisture and minimum of 50 per cent fat in dry matter for paneer. The officials will also make sure if the coagulants: lemon juice, citric acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, fermented milk, sour/cultured whey, yoghurt and lactic cultures, had been used beyond accepted levels.",
