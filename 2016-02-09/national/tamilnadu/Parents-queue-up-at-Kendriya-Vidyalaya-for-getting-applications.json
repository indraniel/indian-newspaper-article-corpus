James\n\nScores of parents started queuing up at Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) at Narimedu since 4:30 a.m. on Monday as distribution of applications for Class I admission in all KV schools began.\n\n\u201cFee is considerably lesser compared to private schools. Once the child enters KV in Class I, there will be no issue over changing schools if we move to other cities as KV-to-KV transfers are possible. That is why we are desperate,\u201d said K. Muthulakshmi, who had come from Anna Nagar later in the morning to get an application.\n\nHowever, school administration said that there was no need for the parents to be in a rush as there were no restrictions on the number of applications and admissions were not done on first-come-first-serve basis.\n\n\u201cI think they assumed that admissions are similar to private schools where they have to struggle to even get an application form. Parents started queuing up at 4:30 a.m. itself even though we had announced that the distribution will commence only by 9 a.m.,\u201d said G.S. Murugan, Headmaster.\n\nMoreover, he added that application forms could also be downloaded from the school website. He said that forms would be distributed and accepted till March 10, 2016. \u201cThe procedure is very transparent and the eligibility conditions are clearly mentioned in the brochure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that for the 40 out of 160 seats in Class 1, which are reserved for allocation under Right to Education Act, a draw of lots would be conducted on March 16 at the school in the presence of all parents who had applied.",
