Venkateswarlu, Post Master General (Mails & Business Development), the proposal to install cameras came after complaints of pilferage were reported in some trains, particularly the Chennai-New Delhi Grand Trunk Express. A sting operation revealed that postal employees of Madhya Pradesh were involved in the thefts.\n\nE-commerce\n\ndoing well\n\n\u201cWe lodged a complaint with the police and the two employees were arrested and later suspended by the department. Citing this incident, it was proposed to install surveillance cameras in postal vans. The Postal Directorate approved the idea and we are in the process of implementing the project,\u201d Mr. Venkateswarlu told The Hindu on Monday.\n\nConsequent to various business development initiatives launched by Chief Post Master General Charles Lobo, e-commerce was now making a significant contribution to postal business, he added.\n\nThe revenue generated through e-commerce increased from Rs. 1 crore in 2013 to Rs. 7 crore last year.\n\n\u201cWe have already crossed Rs. 9 crore in December 2015 and may touch the Rs. 15 crore mark by the end of this fiscal.\n\nAmazon is a major contributor to our business and we are roping in Flipkart as well,\u201d he said.\n\nWith CCTV in postal coaches, the department can avert pilferage and travel of unauthorised persons.\n\nThe handling of consignments can also be monitored as there are some complaints of damaged articles in parcels post delivery, Mr. Venkateswarlu added.",
