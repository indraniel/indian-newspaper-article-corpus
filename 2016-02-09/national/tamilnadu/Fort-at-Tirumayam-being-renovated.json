    "text": "The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has taken up reconstructing the compound of the ancient fort at Tirumayam on the Pudukottai \u2013 Sivaganga National Highway.\n\nThe compound was destroyed during the course of a battle centuries ago and the ASI has initiated steps for restoring it. The work, which commenced in December, aims at construction of the compound to a length of 100 metres and for a height of 10 metres.\n\n\u201cWe have brought the boulders needed for the compound from the adjoining hilly area. We ensure that the original methodology with regard to materials is adopted, so that the grandeur is retained,\u201d a source told \u2018The Hindu\u2019 here on Monday.\n\nThis was the fourth phase of renovation. Earlier, the damaged parts of the fort were re-built. The fort has two major temples dedicated to Sri Sathyamurthy- Sri Uyyavanda Nachiar (Vaishnavite) and Sri Sathyagireeswarar-Sri Venuvaneeswari (Saivite). In the earlier phases, the three-tier merlon \u2014 at the top, middle and base of the fort \u2014 were renovated. Clearing of vegetation with stronger roots such as banyan using a tree-killer, a non-chemical substance, was a major achievement. This was followed by the strengthening work, involving a series of reinforcing processes \u2014 crouting, pointing and brickwork and plastering. Details were worked out for the renovation of the merlons. They were strengthened using lime, terminlia chevula (\u2018kadukkai\u2019) and palm sugar (\u2018panai vellam\u2019). To protect the \u2018pushkarani\u2019 at the fort, the ASI has set up a chain-link, which would prevent straying of cattle.",
