The third corridor, the world\u2019s longest, at Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram was built by the king.\n\nAfter the Chief Minister unveiled the statue, Collector S. Natarajan garlanded it even as members of \u201cMamannar Rebel Muthuramalinga Sethupathy Makkal Iyakkam\u201d and a group of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) volunteers raised slogans hailing the king and the Chief Minister.\n\nAfter the Collector paid floral tributes, Raja N. Kumaran Sethupathy, the heir of the king, A. Anwar Raja, MP, and AIADMK district office-bearers, including Dharmar, K.C. Animuthu and Kavitha Sasikumar, paid floral tributes to the king.\n\nThe statue was made ready in 2010 after the State government passed an order in 1995 to unveil a statue in honour of Muthuramalinga Sethupathy (1760-1809), the first Tamil king to rebel against the British.\n\nA couple of years later, the Public Works Department (PWD) installed the statue on a pedestal but it could not be unveiled immediately following a Supreme Court order on installing statues at public places.\n\nAs a result, the statue of the king, who had spent nearly half of his life in prison, remained \u2018imprisoned\u2019 for nearly three years.\n\nThe third corridor, the world\u2019s longest, at Rameswaram temple was built by the king",
