Karunakaran said that over 3,000 customers had purchased Rs. 3.50 lakh-worth fruits and vegetables ever since it became operational in mid-January. Since the prices of fruits and vegetables being sold at the outlet was 25 to 35 per cent less than the open market prices, over a hundred customers were purchasing the farm produces at the outlet every day.\n\n\u201cAs the customer base of the outlet is increasing steadily, the farmers may sell their produces to this outlet directly to get better prices. Now, we\u2019ve fixed a sale target of Rs. 50,000 a day for the outlet,\u201d Dr. Karunakaran said.",
