Dudnik Valentyn (66), an Ukranian national, and its Tactical Deployment Officer F. Paul David Dennish Towers (52), a Briton. Denying the charge of having entered Indian waters illegally, they claimed that their vessel had got stranded on high seas since it ran out of diesel, when the Indian Coast Guard intercepted it.\n\nExplaining the reason for not having given a distress call to the port authorities, the appellants said: \u201cRunning out of diesel is not a distress or perils of the sea warranting giving communication to the port authorities. In such circumstances, the captain will send communication to his owner who will arrange for diesel through his agent or advise the captain to procure diesel from another vessel in mid-sea.\u201d\n\nFurther, they have not been accused of any kind of confrontation or untoward incident. A joint interrogation of the crew members by the Coast Guard, the Customs and other agencies did not reveal anything serious and hence the case was handed over to the Tharuvaikulam Marine police.\n\nClaim that their vessel had got stranded on high seas as it ran out of diesel",
