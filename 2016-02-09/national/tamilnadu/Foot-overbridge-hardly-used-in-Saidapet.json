Just a few metres away, a foot overbridge (FOB) is found.\n\nThough motorists question the location of the signal, commuters make optimum use of it. In contrast, the FOB is hardly used. Commuters complain that the FOB is steep. Sri Rangan, one of the commuters, said the signal helped them cross the road at the junction now.\n\n\u201cI hardly see anyone using this FOB ever since it was installed. I fail to understand how anyone would want to build such a steep structure for people. Won\u2019t they put themselves in the commuters\u2019 shoes before constructing something like this for them?\u201d he asked. The FOB that cost Rs. 33 lakh was opened in 2011. Raji Srinivasan, another commuter said: Since it is a wide road, we would literally run to cross the road. But now, traffic personnel help us cross the road. But motorists are not happy with this move; they say the signal only increases their travel time. S. Santhosh said, \u201cAs such, there is signal almost at every junction; this one is unusually placed too. Of course, I don\u2019t blame the commuters for not using the foot-over-bridge and choosing the signal,\u201d he added.",
