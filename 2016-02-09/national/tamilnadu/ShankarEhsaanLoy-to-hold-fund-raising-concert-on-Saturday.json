    "text": "The Shakti Foundation will organise Gurukripa 2016, a fundraising concert by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy, on February 13 (6 p.m.) at The Music Academy.\n\nAccording to a press release, the musical trio \u2014 Shankar Mahadevan, Ehsaan Noorani and Loy Mendonsa \u2014 will combine carnatic and hindustani vocals (Shankar), western rock (Ehsaan) and a fusion including a virtual mastery over the electronic synthesizer (Loy).\n\nThe concert is expected to reflect aspects of a tradition quite common in Bollywood music, that of partnerships between music composers contributing and pooling their individual strengths, sometimes combining deep knowledge of Hindustani or Carnatic classical music and technical expertise as composers and orchestral arrangers.\n\nShankar-Ehsaan-Loy would entertain audiences of Gurukripa with their chart-topping music. Gurukripa would facilitate fundraising for the Shakti Foundation\u2019s social cause.\n\nStarted in 1991, the Shakti Foundation has over the years strived to take forward its founder Velan Raghuvir\u2019s vision of an equitable society, to provide medical facilities to people in rural areas and the weaker sections of society. The Foundation has also focussed on integration of the physically challenged into the mainstream and a barrier-free environment by way of ramps. Over the years, The Shakti Foundation\u2019s annual concerts have featured acclaimed musicians from across the world.",
