    "text": "The roof garden scheme being implemented by the Directorate of Horticulture and Plantation Crops is poised for introduction in the districts from the next financial year.\n\nIt envisages providing urban dwellers interested in greening terraces of residential buildings with \u2018Do-it-Yourself\u2019 kit under Urban Horticulture Development Scheme.\n\nThe scheme would be implemented from 2015-16 in Erode district, official sources said.\n\nMany takers\n\nCurrently under implementation in Chennai and Coimbatore, the scheme under which the Horticulture Department provides hybrid seedlings, water soluble fertilizer and bio pesticides and fungicides for cultivation of fruits and vegetables has found many takers.\n\nConcern\n\nAccording to senior officials, there was no cause for any concern about use of hybrid seeds.\n\nThe assurance comes in the wake of apprehensions raised by the farmers in the district about the health consequences arising from use of genetically modified seeds.\n\nThe scheme must accord a thrust for utilisation of native seeds, said Suba Thalapathi, president of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers\u2019 Association.\n\nCertified seeds\n\nA senior official said certified hybrid seeds would be provided and not genetically modified ones that had proved to be quite productive, but cause health complications. The short-duration varieties of vegetable seeds developed by TNAU had proved to be remunerative to the growers.\n\nThe scheme is awaited since there will be scope for cultivating vegetables and fruits free of toxins, say residents in large-sized apartments.\n\nThe Horticulture Department provides hybrid seedlings for cultivation of fruits and vegetables",
