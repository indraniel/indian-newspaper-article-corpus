Udhayakumar has warned.\n\n\u201cIf these two major Dravidian parties fail to make their stand clear within one month on the KKNPP, wherein major breakdowns are happening frequently as it has been executed with equipment fabricated with substandard materials, the PMANE will resume the indefinite fast against the upcoming nuclear park,\u201d Mr. Udhayakumar told reporters here on Monday.\n\nHe complained that KKNPP\u2019s first reactor, on becoming operational again after being under seven-month-long maintenance, stopped generating electricity owing to a punctured steam line and it proved PMANE\u2019s charges on the liberal use of substandard materials in constructing the reactor and its subsystems.\n\nMr. Udhayakumar claimed that there was no slackness in PMANE\u2019s struggle against the KKNPP and no divide among the protestors even after one of his anti-nuke colleagues R.S. Mugilan \u201chad acted in a wayward fashion\u201d (by surrendering before a court in a few cases filed against him when the anti-KKNPP agitation was intense).\n\n\u201cHe (Mr. Mugilan) is acting at the behest of somebody, who wants to dent the PMANE. The anti-nukes will always vigorously oppose the KKNPP and anti-people projects like GAIL\u2019s (LNG) gas pipeline, neutrino, etc. We\u2019ll join hands with the protesting people and strengthen their agitation,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, coordinator of People\u2019s Federation Against Nuclear Energy Kolathur Mani said in Madurai on Monday that when other States were opposing setting up of nuclear power plants, the Centre was trying to establish four more nuclear power units in Kudankulam.\u201cThis comes at a time when the first unit has suffered multiple break downs owing to substandard materials used for fabricating equipment. The second unit was yet to start power production,\u201d he said.\n\nThe State government had not withdrawn cases filed against anti-nuclear protestors as instructed by the Supreme Court. \u201cThe government is trying to intimidate the common man by issuing summons in connection with those cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federation would stage a demonstration in Madurai on Wednesday in this regard, he added.",
