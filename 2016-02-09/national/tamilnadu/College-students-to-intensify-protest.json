Subramanian at the Perur Taluk Office on Monday.\n\nA students\u2019 representative said that the five students, who had represented their case, wanted construction of toilets for girls, improved facilities in laboratories, filling up of vacant teaching posts and a playground.\n\nThey said they were disappointed on the issue of filling up vacant teaching posts and alleged that there was no commitment from the management. Hence, wanted to intensify their protest, he added.\n\nThe college management said that it had appointed a few guest lecturers at the start of the academic year to manage the vacancy in students\u2019 interest. It would get the State Government\u2019s approval for filling up the vacant posts at the earliest.\n\nThe management also said that its representatives requested the officials to return to the college and open the administrative office that had remained locked since the start of the agitation.\n\nNext round of talks\n\nOfficial sources that facilitated the meeting said that they had asked both sides to reconsider their position before the next round of talks though no date for it had been fixed.",
