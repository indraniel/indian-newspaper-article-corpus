A total of 400 farmers were shareholders of the company, and crops such as millets and pulses were being procured directly from farmers at reasonable prices, P. Murugesan, chairman of the company and general secretary of Southern Dry Land Farmers\u2019 Association, Pudur, told The Hindu on Sunday.\n\nThe company had got a dehusker machine sponsored by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, and dhal processor equipment provided with government subsidy. Since there was a growing demand for \u2018kuthiraivali\u2019 (barnyard millet) among people now, five tonnes of kuthiraivali had been procured directly from the farmers. Hundred kg of the grain cost Rs. 2, 000. Currently, harvesting of this crop was under way and the company had planned to procure 150 more tonnes.\n\nThis millet crop fetched a market price of Rs. 1, 800 per 100 kg of raw grain in January, 2015 and Rs. 2,500 in September, 2015. After dehusking, the company could get 50 kg of fine grain from 100 kg of raw grain. Hundred kg of the fine grain would be marketed at Rs. 4,000, including transportation cost, he said.\n\nKuthiraivali could grow on arid tracts, and the yield would be 6-8 quintals per acre. Mr. Murugesan said that this farm producers\u2019 company had established a direct market link with National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), Chennai, which had come forward to procure 200 tonnes of black gram.\n\nNAFED representatives recently collected the crop samples at 20 villages in Ottapidaram, Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam areas, he added.",
