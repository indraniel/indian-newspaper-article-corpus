Baskar.\n\nAfter renovation works, Tirupakulam was recently opened while work continued in Jetty Kulam.\n\nBesides desilting, strengthening of bunds, beautification works, installing of lights, footpaths and erecting wired fences were done.\n\nThe Jetty Kulam was converted into a park with lawn facility.\n\nMinister for Industries and Transport P. Thangamani inaugurated the park in the presence of the MLA and Collector V. Dakshinamoorthy here on Saturday night.\n\nThe lake served as a place for holy dip for devotees visiting Narasimhar temple and Anjaneyar temple.\n\nHowever, over the years, due to encroachments and mushrooming of houses in the area, the lake was used as a dumping ground for garbage.\n\nAt present, water is stored in the lake and boat service is also introduced.\n\nBoth the lakes located on the sides of Narasimhar temple will serve as a place for the public and the devotees to spend their leisure time.\n\nLights\n\nVisitors to the lake wanted lights to be installed in the fort so that they can enjoy the beauty of the fort during night hours.",
