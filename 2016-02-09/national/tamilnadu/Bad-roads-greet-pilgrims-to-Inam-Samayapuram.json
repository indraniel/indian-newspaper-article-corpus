    "text": "Inam Samayapuram may not be popular when compared to Samayapuram where devotees flock in large numbers daily to have a darshan of Goddess Mariamman. But, a section of devotees, who know the detailed history of Sri Mariamman, invariably visit Inam Samayapuram temple, which is believed to be the birth place of Her, to seek the blessings of Adhi Mariamman.\n\nThe temple receives huge crowd on new moon, full moon, Fridays and holidays.\n\nHowever, the road that leads to Adhi Mariamman temple from Samayapuram is neglected for so long, posing hardship to the devotees and residents of nearby villages. The road is fully battered. The recent rain has also had its negative impact.\n\nThe top portion of the \u2018thar\u2019 road is totally damaged. It makes life difficult for the motorists to ride on the pothole-riddled road. There are complaints that the unevenness has resulted in motorcycles skidding of the road when the surface is wet. According to a rough estimate, nearly one tenth of devotees, who visit Samayapuram Sri Mariamman temple, visit Adhi Mariamman temple at Inam Samayapuram. But, the temple has not been given its due importance. The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), which is the nodal agency for maintaining rural roads, has not re-laid the road for so long. \u201cWe have petitioned to the authorities to improve the road from Samayapuram to Inam Samayapuram on many occasions. However, no action has been taken so far,\u201d said a resident of Samayapuram.",
