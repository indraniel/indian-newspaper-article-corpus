About 700 gathered for the protest, said C. Manoharan, project director, National Federation of the Blind, one of the groups involved.\n\nAmong the demands of the groups are: those with over 40 per cent disabilities and who have the government ID card should be given financial assistance by the government. The groups also want the assistance amount to be increased to Rs. 5,000 and for the clause restricting assistance to those who are destitute to be removed, he said.\n\n\u201cWe also want the State to ensure barrier-free environments throughout.\n\nThe government should set aside funds for this. Also, 100 houses should be given to the disabled under different housing schemes and these should be in places where there is adequate transport,\u201d he said.This apart, the 3 per cent job reservation rule should be followed with a committee that is headed by a High Court judge and has members of the disabled community as members, he said.",
