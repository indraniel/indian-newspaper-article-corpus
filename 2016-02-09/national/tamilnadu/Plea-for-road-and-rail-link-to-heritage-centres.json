Radhakrishnan, Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, listening to the views of road safety volunteers in Pudukottai on Monday.\n\nThe Public Welfare Association of Road Accident (Prevention and Rescue) has urged the Union Ministry of Surface Transport to explore the possibility of setting up a national highway from Kozhikode to Vedaranyam via Thuvarankurichi and Alangudi.\n\nIn a memorandum to the Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, a delegation of office-bearers of the association led by its president, K. Mohanraj, said it would form a vital link of historical and ancient heritage centres such as Kozhikode, Palakad, Dindigul, Pudukottai and Vedaranyam. A traim service could be provided on this sector.\n\nOnce the road and rail link is provided between Kozhikode and Vedaranyam, it will be a blessing for train and bus commuters. For instance, the economic status of residents and commuters between Dindigul and Vedaranyam; Pudukottai and Dindigul; Pattukottai and Dindigul would augment in a big way. It would reduce the travelling time and thereby promote economy, the memorandum said. The Union Minister of State assured the delegates of prompt action.",
