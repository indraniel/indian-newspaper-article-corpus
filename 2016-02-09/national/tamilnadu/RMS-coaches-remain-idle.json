    "text": "For more than a decade, at least 10 coaches designed for the Railway Mail Service (RMS) by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) here are reportedly lying idle in the Tondiarpet Yard.\n\nWhile sources in the Postal department claimed that the coaches had a coupling issue and need to be repaired for operation, railway sources maintained that the coaches were fit to run.\n\nSince the postal coaches remained unused for years, the railway authorities were moving them for periodical overhauling at regular intervals.\n\n\u201cThese coaches have been occupying our yard space for several years now. We have no idea why they are not being used. The Postal department can simply replace its existing vans in trains with these new coaches,\u201d a railway official said.",
