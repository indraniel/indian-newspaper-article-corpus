James\n\nA group of Dalits from Uthapuram village on Monday demanded equal distribution of the relief amount, ordered recently by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court for those affected in the 2008 communal clash, to all Dalit families in the village.\n\nAlleging partiality by the functionaries of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Dalits, who petitioned Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, said that it was unfair to provide the relief amount to select families as the entire Dalit community in the village was affected in the violence.\n\nHearing a case filed by S.K. Ponnuthai, district president of All India Democratic Women\u2019s Association (AIDWA), affiliated to the CPI (M), the High Court Bench ordered the State government to pay Rs. 1,19,40,000, at the rate of Rs. 60,000 each, to 199 affected Dalit families.\n\nPreparatory work was in progress and cheques were expected to be handed over to the families at District Legal Services Authority office in Madurai on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe want the Collector to intervene and ensure that all the 500 Dalit families in the village get the money ,\u201d said V. Kasirajan, one of the petitioners.\n\nRefutes allegations\n\nWhen contacted, T. Chellakannu, district secretary of CPI (M)-affiliated Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF), who was actively involved in the court case, refuted the allegations of partiality.\n\n\u201cThe original list of 191 families was based on enquiries conducted by a commission formed soon after the riot. Eight more families who came forward later were also accommodated in the court case filed by us. No one else came forward until now assuming that the case will not succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nStating that the TNUEF was not against granting relief fund to other Dalit families, Mr. Chellakannu, however, said that it was not possible to include them now as the court had issued the final order.",
