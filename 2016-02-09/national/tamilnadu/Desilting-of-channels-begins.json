Karunakaran formally inaugurated desilting and renovation of Manur and Pallamadai irrigation channels planned on an outlay of Rs. 3.98 crore on Monday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr. Karunakaran said that the 686-hectare Manur Big Tank, which was getting water from Chittar, was nourishing 341 hectares directly and another 1,182 hectares through 23 irrigation tanks in this region.\n\nThe surplus water from Manur tank was being diverted to irrigation tanks in Ramasamypuram and Madhavakurichi.\n\nSince the channels taking water from Manur tank were covered with silt, the walls of these channels were in a dilapidated condition at several places and a good number of shutters had to be reconstructed, the State government had allotted Rs. 2.28 crore for this project, which would benefit Veerakeralampudhur, Agaram, Thuththikulam, Naranapuram, Mayamankurichi, Kurippankulam, Ayyanarkulam, Therkkupatti, Yettankulam, Mavadi, Manur and Madhavakurichi.\n\nThe irrigation channels under Pallamadai irrigation tank, which was feeding 620 hectares, would be desilted and renovated on an outlay of Rs. 1.70 crore to benefit irrigation lands in Nettoor, Pallikottai, Subbiahpuram, Kalakkudi, Kanarpatti, Seethaikurichi, Therkkupatti, Pallamadai and Thenkalampudhur.\n\nTirunelveli MLA Nainar Nagendran, whose efforts ensured the release of funds for this project, MPs K.R.P. Prabhakaran and Vijila Sathyananth, Revenue Divisional Officer P. Fermi Vidhya and Public Works Department officials participated.",
