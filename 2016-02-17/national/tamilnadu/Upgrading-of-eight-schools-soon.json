    "text": "Upgrading of eight middle schools in Madurai district, which was getting delayed due to non-availability of land, would commence soon, said officials from School Education Department.\n\nMiddle schools in Soorapatti, Periya Alangulam, Ayan Papakudi, Nilaiyur, Papakudipatti, A. Thotiyapatti, Meenakshipatti and Kinnimangalam were selected to be upgraded as high schools under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) scheme.\n\nAccording to officials, Rs.1.61 crore was allocated to each of these eight schools for construction of new buildings and improving other infrastructure about a year ago.\n\nHowever, the work could not be started as adequate land was not available in the schools for construction and the local bodies could not allot any land.\n\nOfficial sources said that the issue was later taken up with the office of the District Revenue Office. The revenue officials now identified and allotted land for these schools.",
