Bhuvaneshwari during Tirunelveli corporation council meeting on Tuesday.\u2014 Photo: A. Shaikmohideen\n\nThe corporation council meeting held here on Tuesday witnessed noisy scenes and sit-in dharna by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam councillors after they alleged that no development work was taken up in the corporation since 2011.\n\nWhen Mayor E. Bhuvaneshwari started reading resolutions hailing Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for her recent announcements on developmental works proposed elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, DMK councillor Kittu alias Ramakrishnan urged her to give details of the works carried out in the corporation limits. \u201cSince no development has been carried out in the corporation, you cannot pinpoint anything,\u201d Mr. Ramakrishnan said.\n\nBefore Mr. Ramakrishnan completed his speech, independent member Subramanian alias \u2018Kopparai\u2019 Subramanian reiterated the charges which triggered heated argument between him and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam councillor \u2018Kurichi\u2019 Sekar.\n\nDMK and MDMK councillors supported Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Subramanian, who were engaged in a heated argument with the Mayor.\n\n\u201cWe (AIADMK members) are prepared for a discussion on the baseless charges\u2026 We\u2019ll prove that we\u2019d executed the development works the city is in need of\u2026 If you are still keen on disturbing the proceedings\u2026 better stage a walkout, as Mr. Stalin and your party MLAs do from the Assembly every time,\u201d Ms. Bhuvaneshwari said.\n\nAt one point, the DMK and MDMK members sat on the floor in front of the Mayor\u2019s chair, raising slogans against her.\n\nNone of the AIADMK members came to her rescue. Meanwhile, Ms. Bhuvaneshwari said that all but one resolution placed before the council had been passed and left the hall.\n\nMs. Bhuvaneshwari, after returning to her chamber from the council meeting that commenced 45 minutes late due to lack of quorum, told reporters that development works to the tune of Rs. 24.71 crore had been completed in Tirunelveli Zone over the past four and a half years.\n\nBasic infrastructure had been either created or strengthened in Thatchanallur (at a cost of Rs. 20.85 crore), Melapalayam (Rs. 29. 45 crore) and Palayamkottai Zones (Rs. 23 crore).\n\n\u201cAdministrative sanction has been given for constructing elevated parking facility at Tirunelveli Junction bus stand on an outlay of Rs. 25 crore and renovating parks and creating new parks at a cost of Rs. 20 crore,\u201d she said.",
