The Centre intervention is needed only when it comes to financial assistance and environment clearances\u201d, he pointed out.\n\nMr. Anbumani complimented the activists supporting the Athikadavu - Avinashi scheme for turning their agitations into a mass movement.\n\nHowever, he requested the activists to give up fast on the grounds of health. \u201cI appreciated their efforts but they could opt for other forms of agitation considering their deteriorating health\u201d, he said.\n\nAnti-nuclear energy activist S. P. Udayakumar held interactions with the activists supporting the project at Avinashi on Tuesday Kongunadu Janayaga Katchi founder G. K. Nagaraj sounded his disappointment that no financial allocation was made towards meeting the projected expenditure of Athikadavu- Avinashi scheme.",
