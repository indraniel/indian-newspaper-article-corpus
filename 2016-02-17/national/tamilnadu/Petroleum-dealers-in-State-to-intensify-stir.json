    "text": "In a move that could cut off fuel supplies to the State\u2019s entire western belt, the Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association (TNPDA) on Tuesday decided to scale up their \u201cstop-purchase\u201d agitation from oil company depots in Coimbatore and Karur districts too.\n\nThe TNPDA had been agitating since Monday demanding that fuel outlets run by the Lorry Owners\u2019 Associations (LOA) in the Kongu region stop offering discounts to customers as it affected the business of other fuel stations. Over 400 petroleum dealers in the region had not lifted supplies since Monday leading to many bunks going dry.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Salem district administration convened a meeting of TNPDA office-bearers, oil companies and LOA.\n\nDistrict Collector V. Sampath, who gave the assurance that boards announcing discounts from the outlets run by LOA will be removed, asked the TNPDA to withdraw its strike. He also sought a month\u2019s time to speak to oil companies and find a solution. Oil company representatives also gave similar assurances. However, the TNPDA representatives said it was not enough if the boards are removed.\n\nTNPDA president K.P. Murali said they had given enough notice to oil companies. \u201cOur dealers are losing business because the LOA outlets are hogging everything by giving discounts. The oil companies must ensure uniform pricing in all outlets,\u201d he said.\n\nM.R. Kumaraswamy, president, Lorry Owners Federation (Tamil Nadu), said it would not be possible for LOA to not offer incentives to customers.\n\nThey want outlets owned by lorry owners to offering discounts to customers",
