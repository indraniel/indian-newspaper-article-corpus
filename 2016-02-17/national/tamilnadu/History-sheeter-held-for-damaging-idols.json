Senapathi, who was irked over the villagers not supporting his demand to conduct rooster fight during a temple festival, has been charged with breaking 51 earthen figures of horses and 15 idols of various Gods at a temple near Kottampatti.\n\nPolice said that Senapathi proposed conduct of rooster fight during Sri Elangamudi Ayyanar Temple at Kambur. However, with the police laying down stringent rules for the conduct of \u2018puravi eduthal\u2019 festival, offering earthen figures of horses to God, the villagers turned down his proposal since rooster fight was banned by Supreme Court.\n\nAngered over this, Senapathi challenged the village committee over the peaceful conduct of the festival, the police said.\n\nWith deployment of a huge police force, the festival went off smoothly on February 11 and 12.\n\nHowever, on Sunday afternoon, the earthen figures of horses and idols of Gods at the temple were found broken.\n\nActing on a complaint lodged by the village head, Marudhupandian, the police found that Senapthi, along with a few others, broke them.\n\nHe has been booked under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act, 1992.",
