    "text": ": The entire Opposition, barring the PMK, staged a walkout from the Assembly, alleging that the ruling AIADMK had lost its moral right to present the budget.\n\nThe six DMDK MLAs whose suspension was revoked by the Supreme Court were present in the House and joined their colleagues in the walkout.\n\nWhen the House met on Tuesday morning for the presentation of budget by Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, the Opposition members sought to raise issues which they claimed required the immediate attention of the government.\n\nLater talking to reporters, DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin said the debt of the State government had increased to over Rs. 2.11 lakh crore from Rs. 90,000 crore during the DMK regime.\n\n\u201cWhile the State government is struggling financially, it is just making empty announcements. It has no right to present the budget,\u201d Mr Stalin said.\n\nDMDK whip V.C. Chandrakumar alleged that the administration had come to a standstill as the State government had failed to resolve the problems of agitating government employees, teachers and differently abled persons.\n\nCPI (M) floor leader A. Soundararajan said flood relief had not reached many people even after two months and the law and order situation in the State had deteriorated.\n\nCPI leader M. Arumugam said his party was denied permission to discuss vital issues concerning the people.\n\nCongress leader K. Gopinath said the government had failed to ensure that linguistic minority students were allowed to learn in their mother tongue.",
