    "text": "A 45-year-old man died after he fell down from the third floor of a building under construction in Tiruvanmiyur on Monday.\n\nNataraj of Ramapuram, who was working on the site, was standing on the edge of the third floor when a material-lifting machine was being pulled up. The machine was carrying construction materials and after it was pulled and placed on the third floor, a pulley attached to it was dangling in the air on the ground floor, investigating policemen said. The pulley accidentally got hooked on to an autorickshaw and when the auto driver started the vehicle, it pulled the lifting machine too. In the impact, Nataraj, who was holding on to the machine, was pulled down and he fell. He was critically injured and was rushed to a private hospital, where he died. Arumugham (45), the building owner, has been arrested.",
