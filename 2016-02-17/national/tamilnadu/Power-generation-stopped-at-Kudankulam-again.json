However, the generation had to be stopped last Saturday following the leak in the pipe carrying steam.\n\nThough it was reportedly rectified, the problem has resurfaced to hit power generation once again.\n\n\u2018The unforeseen leak in secondary circuit tube forced us to stop power generation on Tuesday\u201d",
