    "text": "Sivakasi Development Organisation has sought upgradation of the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Office (EPFO) in Sivakasi to a sub-regional office for better facilities for the 2.50 lakh subscribers and 20,000 pensioners of PF.\n\nIn a statement, its president, A.P. Selvarajan, said that the present office was functioning like a district office with limited services.\n\nPensioners have to go all the way to the regional office in Madurai to get their grievances, if any, redressed.\n\nThough the EPFO was conducting grievance day meeting in Sivakasi at regular intervals, he said the two-decade-old demand for the setting up of a sub-regional office at Sivakasi has not fructified. Mr. Selvarajan pointed out that Nagercoil which had just 75,000 subscribers has got a sub-regional office.\n\nBut, the office in Sivakasi with 2.50 lakh subscribers has not been upgraded to a sub-regional office, Mr. Selvarajan said.\n\nThe statement also said that every year a new sub-regional office of the EPFO was being opened in the neighbouring States that gives a lot of relief to the subscribers and pensioners in getting their benefits.\n\n2.50 lakh subscribers and 20,000 pensioners of PF will benefit from this upgradation",
