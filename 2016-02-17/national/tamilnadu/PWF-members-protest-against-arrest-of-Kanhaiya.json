Viswanathan, secretary of the CPI condemned the illegal detention of students and said the BJP was trying to curtail freedom of expression. The filing of sedition case against the president of JNU students union is objectionable and the case should be withdrawn, he said.\n\nCPI (M) secretary R. Rajangam accused the BJP-led NDA of trying to undermine the secular fabric of the country. The attack on journalists and teachers at the Patiala House courts has exposed the real face of the BJP and how the Government is running the country, he said.",
