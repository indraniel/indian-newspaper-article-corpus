Karunakaran\n\nRevenue officials of Alandur taluk on Tuesday inspected the plot of land that has allegedly been encroached upon by Pallavaram Municipality and a section of residents near Putheri Lake and Mangani Kulam in Zamin Raayapettai.\n\nThe National Green Tribunal (NGT), Southern Bench, had issued orders to Revenue officials last week to conduct a survey of the waterbodies and surrounding areas where the Pallavaram Municipality is constructing a bio-methanation plant.\n\nIn his appeal, N. Krishnan of Zamin Raayapettai in Chromepet requested an injunction restraining the municipality from commissioning the plant or any other project in the building on the Putheri lake in survey numbers 273, 273/2 and 273/24.\n\nHe said the municipality had created a sand bed in the midst of the lake on the southern side and started to build the plant.\n\n\u201cThe encroachments made by private individuals and also by the municipality are in utter violation of a Government Order of the Rural Development Department.\n\nThe residents took up the case with Madras High Court, which called for a submission of records by the Alandur Tahsildar and this was upheld by the Supreme Court too.\n\nMembers of Zamin Raayapettai Grama Nala Sangam wanted the municipality to stop encroaching on water bodies immediately to save 2,000 residents, who were already in dire need of water.\n\nRevenue officials said they would submit their report.",
