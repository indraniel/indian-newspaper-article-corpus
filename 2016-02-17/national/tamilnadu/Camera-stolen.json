    "text": "A high-end camera of a news channel employee was stolen recently. Vinod Raj had placed an online advertisement to rent out his camera, police said. On February 8, he got a call from a man named Shiva who told Vinod that he would send his assistant Karthik to his office to pick it up. When Karthik arrived, Vinod asked for an identity proof and was informed that Shiva had e-mailed it, police said. However, before Vinod could check his mail, Karthik fled with the camera. When Vinod realised he was tricked, he lodged a complaint along with the CCTV footage he was able to recover of Karthik leaving with his camera.",
