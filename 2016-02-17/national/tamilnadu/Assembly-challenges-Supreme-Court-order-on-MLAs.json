    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and its Speaker on Tuesday moved a review petition before the Supreme Court against its judgment revoking the suspension of six DMDK legislators from the Assembly.\n\nOn February 13, a Bench of Justices J. Chelameswar and A.M. Sapre held that the Privileges Committee committed a violation of principles of natural justice by not showing the suspended lawmakers video clippings of their alleged misconduct, thus robbing them an opportunity to defend themselves.\n\nIn the review petition filed by advocate B. Balaji, the Speaker and the Assembly said the judgment needed to be re-considered.\n\n\u201cUnless there is a finding of mala fides or bias against the House or the members of the Legislative Assembly, it cannot be held that the non supply of the video clipping resulted in violation of principles of natural justice,\u201d the petition contended.\n\nThe petition contended that the apex court did not take note of the fact that the video clipping of February 19, 2015 was available via media in all TV channels as well as the Internet.\n\n\u201cThe incident was reported in all newspaper dailies. Therefore, the question of providing the video clippings does not materially affect the impugned resolution (suspension) dated March 31,\u201d the petition contended. It further noted that the members of the Privileges Committee were present in the House when the incident took place and therefore there was no question of them being influenced further by viewing the said video clipping.\n\n\u201cAll six petitioners knew of the video clipping as they had been shown on all TV Channels,\u201d the petition argued.",
