    "text": "Officials of the Coimbatore Corporation, Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, and Tangedco met here to discuss ways to improve water supply.\n\nMayor P. Rajkumar said that temporary disruptions in power supply impacted the pumping of water from the Pilloor Reservoir.\n\nTangedco \u2018changing trips\u2019 for a few minutes for four to five times a day had a cascading effect on water supply.\n\nA TWAD Board official said that every time the Tangedco stopped power supply \u2013 even if it was for a very brief while, the Board had to completely shut down the four motors that pumped the Pilloor water. After the Tangedco restored power supply, the Board had to switch one motor after another with half-an-hour gap to take the water supply to the full capacity of 125 million litres a day (mld).\n\nEach of the motor was of 340 hp and pumped 22,800 litres a minute. If all motors were on, 91,200 litres of water could be pumped a minute.\n\nMr. Rajkumar said that the corporation too faced the same problem as it too had four motors to run under its dedicated Pilloor drinking water supply scheme.\n\nOfficials from the three departments would visit Pilloor Reservoir on Wednesday.",
