The front portion of the bus was badly damaged. Farmers, who were around at the paddy fields for irrigation, rushed to the rescue of the injured, said the vice-president of Narasingampatti panchayat, M. Kannan. The driver got stuck with his leg caught in the mangled steering wheel.\n\nFire and Rescue Service personnel from Melur struggled for more than 30 minutes to relieve him. Ten passengers sustained minor injuries, the police said.\n\nThe Melur police are investigating.",
