A minor collision with a car at Raiganj, West Bengal, forced him on detour to Darjeeling, where he fixed his motorcycle before starting up again.\n\n\u201cI always had a passion for long rides on any vehicle I could get my hands on. During my IIT-Bombay days, I just took off one day on my mother\u2019s Honda Activa through the scenic Western Ghats to reach home at BEL Circle in Bengaluru,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nFor the diehard biker, Myanmar was a surprising paradise with good roads, welcoming people and pristine locations. \u201cI had a guide and an agent from the Tourism Department who escorted me for nine days of riding through the country where I visited many spots, including the historically significant city of Bagan,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Majumdar crossed into Thailand on January 16 through the last Burmese town of Myawaddy and entered the Thai district of Mae Sot.\n\nHe rode on for another 600 km to reach Bangkok and end his expedition on January 18. \u201cIt was one hell of a ride and I think every biker must take that route and go through the experience,\u201d said the Bengaluru youth, who has shipped his bike.\n\nIt was one hell of a ride and I think every biker must take that route and go through the experience.\n\nArunabh Majumdar",
