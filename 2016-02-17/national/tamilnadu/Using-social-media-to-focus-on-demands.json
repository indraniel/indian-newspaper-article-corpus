Raveendran, secretary of Residents Awareness Association, says if 1000 people sign in a campaign, that many mails go to the official concerned. But, more significantly, many residents in the city become aware of the issues as they are shared so widely on Facebook.\n\nAccording to Indian Texpreneurs Federation secretary Prabhu Damodaran, the association members have sent mails on three issues.\n\nThey do receive an acknowledgement for the mail.\n\nWhen several industries send a mail on the same issue, officials take notice. \u201cWe get attention from the respective Ministry and we often see results. \u201d\n\nReporting by\n\nM.
