For, senior officials of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) are expected to make random house visits.\n\nA proposal to get senior officials to make surprise checks at unit offices and random house visits has been made to deal with the \u2018lethargic attitude\u2019 of the local officials.\n\nIn a circular issued by Tangedco to local officials, the agency has stated that senior assessment officers, and operations and management officials should visit section offices, revenue branches and consumer premises to make local officials work efficiently.\n\nConfirming that such a circular had been issued, a senior official of Tangedco said it was issued as part of revenue maximisation by efficiently monitoring the various assessment mechanisms to prevent energy theft and also to bring down the delay in replacement of defective meters and giving new connections. The official said the background for this circular was complaints about delay in uploading of assessment data from handheld devices, replacement of meters, accurate assessment by assessors of different segments of consumers and application of correct tariff. The circular also calls for rotation of assessors periodically as per the service rules to prevent any wrongdoing.\n\nRegular reports from senior officials need to be sent to the department heads concerned, the official added.\n\nThe move has been suggested to deal with the \u2018lethargic attitude\u2019 of\n\nlocal officials",
