    "text": "The Coimbatore District Police had recently asked banks, primary cooperative credit societies and private financial institutions that have their branches close to the areas bordering Kerala to shift their valuables to safer places, close to the city.\n\nThis was suggested following increasing incidents of attack by Maoists at quite a few places in Kerala close to the Tamil Nadu Border.\n\nA senior police officer said that some banks and societies had already moved the valuables deposited and pledged by their customers to safety and the other banks were also working on it. Early last year, the police asked the explosive godowns and gravel units close to the border to keep their explosives at a safer place and make additional safety measures.\n\nRumours are still going rounds about the existence of A. Santhosh Kumar (23) of Angalakurichi near Valparai, who went missing in mid 2014 and reportedly joined the Maoist movement. The police also registered a case based on the complaint lodged by the youth\u2019s father.\n\nIn June last year, the police arrested suspected Maoist C. Kannan (46) and his alleged associates P. Ganapathy (39) of Pollachi, A. Selvaraj (55) and D. Sigamani (27) for helping him join the movement. While it was rumoured that Santhosh was no more, the police after quizzing Kannan in July claimed that he was still alive. At that point, the police said that death of a member of the movement would be published online. With no such intimation, the police believed that he could be alive and a special team was formed to trace his whereabouts. Meanwhile on Tuesday, a senior police officer told reporters here that Santhosh could have died of illness, long ago.",
