Srinath\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Agricultural University \u2013 Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute near here has taken up a research to prevent weeds in agricultural fields\n\nA piece of land measuring 20 cents on the campus of the institute has been divided into 40 plots and each plot is being used for ascertaining the growth of weeds.\n\nDifferent herbicides are being used, each in a plot, to ascertain the impact of a particular herbicide in preventing the growth of weeds.\n\n\u201cWeeds pose a major challenge to farmers particularly during the summer. Cane-growers, black gram cultivators and green gram farmers are the worst-hit as the weeds, due to thick growth, interrupt the growth of their crops,\u201d says P. Pandiyarajan, Dean. The problem being faced by farmers due to non-availability of agricultural labourers or additional expenditure involved in clearing the weeds through labourers can be overcome through the application of herbicides.\n\nFour major herbicides are being applied in each plot. The herbicides \u2013 imazethapyr, quizolafop ethyl, oxylorfen, pendimethalin are applied for the research.\n\n\u201cThe weed growth is so extensive that they form a bed on the crop so that they are known as \u2018mat weed\u2019 which turns otherwise hard to be cleared,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe research aims at helping farmers prevent the emergence of weeds both before and during the process of cultivation of crops, said T. Ramesh, Assistant Professor of Agronomy who has been conducting the research.\n\nParameters such as dry weight of the weeds and cost effectiveness would be ascertained, he added.",
