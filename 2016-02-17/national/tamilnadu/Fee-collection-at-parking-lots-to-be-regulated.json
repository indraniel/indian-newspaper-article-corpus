    "text": "Complaints of exorbitant parking charges are among a raft of reasons that have led the Greater Chennai Corporation to look for new operators for managing 186 parking lots, which include 93 lots that are already in operation. Tenders have been floated to find these operators.\n\nCurrently, TEXCO (Tamilnadu Ex-Servicemen\u2019s Corporation Limited) manages the 93 parking lots and there have been reports of many attendants at these parking lots collecting parking fee that is higher than what has been laid down by the government.\n\nMany of the personnel manning these lots have been found to be collecting Rs. 20 per hour, against the permitted fee of Rs. 5 per six hours and Rs. 20 per day for cars. Motorcycles and autos are exempt from payment of parking fees, but auto drivers are said to be charged.\n\n\u201cThe new operator will collect the parking charges fixed by the government. There is no change in the policy decision of the government on parking charges. The parking rates will not be revised now,\u201d said an official.\n\nAccording to a study by the civic body a few years ago, personnel at a number of parking facilities managed by TEXCO were demanding additional charges in violation of the terms and conditions. The situation has worsened now, with rates increased without any authorisation by the government.\n\nIn 2013, the civic body was planning to permit TEXCO to manage the additional parking lots on congested stretches. But it changed the plan and invited bids from all private agencies to manage the lots.\n\nOf the 93 existing parking lots, six would soon be handed over for Metro Rail project in the city. \u201cThe remaining lots will be managed by a new operator once the tender is finalised,\u201d said an official.",
