    "text": "Following complaints by the district Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit that imported cigarettes were sold to children in shops located near schools, corporation officials raided shops in the city here on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, BJP\u2019s district president N. Annadurai and district general secretary R.P. Gopinath submitted a petition to the Corporation Commissioner K.R. Selvaraj stating that imported cigarettes in different flavours are sold in petty shops near schools and students are easily getting addicted to it. The petition said that tobacco products manufactured in India carry pictorial warning message that sometimes discourage the consumers to buy the products. But these cigarette packets do not have such warning messages nor price or the manufacturing area. They demanded action against shops selling banned cigarettes. On Tuesday, a team led by City Health Officer R. Selvakumar and health officials inspected shops near schools and found shops selling banned cigarettes, pan masala and other banned tobacco items.",
