    "text": "The District Crime Branch Police have registered a case against an insurance agent, and wife, for cheating an aged woman by withdrawing Rs. 32.66 lakh from her account misusing cheques given them.\n\nThough S. Santhakumari (79), a retired teacher in Thudiyalur, had preferred a complaint an year ago, a case was registered only on Monday.\n\nMs. Santhakumari had engaged M. Selvaraj, an insurance agent from Ramanathapuram, to help her with bank transactions, and investments. She had given cheques to him to withdraw money from the bank and give it to her.\n\nSelvaraj withdrew money from her account but refused to give it to her. He, and wife Usha Nandhini threatened her too.\n\nSelvaraj and Usha Nandhini have been booked under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) and 506(i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThey have moved anticipatory bail applications before the Madras High Court.",
