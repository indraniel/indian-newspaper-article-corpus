Singaravelou\n\nThe Puducherry Deaf Society on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the Transport Commissioner with a request to include driving licences to hearing impaired persons in the suggestions sought by the Centre for amendment to the Road Transport and Safety Bill.\n\nIn a memorandum submitted to the Transport Commissioner S.D. Sundaresan, Puducherry Deaf Society president R. Saravanan said that hearing-impaired persons faced a lot of difficulties.\n\nTheir basic rights such as driving licences were being denied to them as the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 prohibits the deaf from procuring a driver\u2019s licence, stating they could be a source of danger to the public.\n\nMr. Saravanan said that as per the 2011 census India had over 50 million hearing-impaired and they were prevented from obtaining a driving licence. People with such disabilities are allowed to drive all over the world except in 26 countries, including India.\n\nThe Puducherry Deaf Society has also urged the Centre to make amendments in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill so as to provide driving licences to hearing-impaired.\n\nHe said that deaf people should be granted licences and allowed to drive after indicating the handicap with a sticker or reflector on the back of the vehicle as in other countries.",
