    "text": "The Madras Institute of Orthopaedics and Trauma (MIOT) Hospital here, where 18 patients had died during the December floods, on Tuesday informed the Madras High Court that none of the deaths was caused due to drowning.\n\n\u201cPost-mortem conducted on the bodies at the government hospitals had not revealed any death due to drowning or under suspicious circumstances,\u201d said P.V.A. Mohandass, Managing Director of the hospital, in response to a PIL plea alleging that there were more casualties due to lack of oxygen as the generators were marooned.\n\nDr. Mohandass said the hospital building was constructed 10 metres above mean sea level and over 150 metres away from the banks of the Adayar. Yet a breach in the Adayar had led to flooding.\n\nIn a separate affidavit, the Chennai District Collector submitted that the hospital was not built on poromboke land and so the question of encroachment did not arise.\n\nChief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh posted the matter to March 31 for further hearing.",
