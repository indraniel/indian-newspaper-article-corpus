    "text": "Traders in other parts of the city, including George Town, complain that they too have been severely affected by traffic diversions owing to the ongoing Metro Rail project.\n\nMerchants in George Town note that nearly one lakh people visit the various business streets of the locality every day. But, customers and traders are put to hardship as the Esplanade Road has been turned into a one-way and a portion of the NSC Bose Road has also been blocked for the project.\n\nTraffic congestion has also worsened on the NSC Bose Road-Esplanade Road junction.\n\n2-km detour\n\nP. Anees Raja, president of the George Town Traders Welfare Association, said: \u201cFinding parking space on the already busy business hub has become more difficult now. People often have to take a detour of two km to get access to some of the shopping streets. Sales have come down by 50-60 per cent as traffic diversion has been on for several months now. We are not against the project but want the work to be completed on time to ease the traffic chaos.\u201d\n\nThere are over 1,400 shops in George Town and members gave a representation on the issue to the Mayor a few months ago.",
