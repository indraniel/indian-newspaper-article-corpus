    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Wednesday said his party MLAs would stay away from the Assembly proceedings for the rest of the session and instead meet the people to explain the alleged misdeeds of the ruling party.\n\nIn a statement here, he alleged that the DMK members were not allowed to express their views in the Assembly and whatever they uttered were expunged by the Speaker.\n\n\u201cBut the ruling party members were allowed to indulge in mudslinging and they unnecessarily dragged the name of my family members in the debate,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party is functioning according to its whims as it has majority in the House. Whether it is the Privileges Committee or the Business Advisory Committee (BAC), the views of the opposition are not taken into consideration,\u201d he alleged.",
