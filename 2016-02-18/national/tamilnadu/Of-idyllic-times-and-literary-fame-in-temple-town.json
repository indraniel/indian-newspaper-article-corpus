Rajagopalan, T. Janakiraman, Karichan Kunju, Ka.Na. Subramaniam and M.V. Venkatram, who were all associated with Manikodi , the literary magazine that was the trendsetter for modernism in Tamil literature, functioned from Kumbakonam.\n\nThey were followed by a new crop of writers, including Indira Parthasarathy, Ra.Ki. Rangarajan, Ki.Ra. Gopalan, Swamimalai Mani, Thronar and artist Gopulu. They ran a library known as \u2018Jayamaruthi Vasagasalai\u2019 and a manuscript magazine. Many of them went on to win literary fame and major awards, including the Sahitya Akademi.\n\nThe old generation of writers used to assemble at Thondarkadai, a stationery shop opposite the Town High School, owned by Thondaradipodi. Over a cup of Kumbakonam filter coffee or a wad of betel leaves, they would endlessly discuss literature. The bathing ghats of the Mahamaham tank also used to be their favourite haunt.\n\n\u201cThey were known as the \u2018Kumbakonam group.\u2019 It functioned continuously from the 1930s to the 1980s. The twins of modern Tamil literature, Ku.Pa. Rajagopalan and N. Pitchamoorthy, were born here. All the writers had close association among themselves,\u201d said V. Arasu, former Head of the Department of Tamil, University of Madras.\n\nGopalarao Library, named after the principal of Kumbakonam Art College, provided the much-needed fodder for young readers.\n\n\u201cIt was there I read the entire works of Maupassant,\u201d recalled Indira Parthasarathy, another native of the town and student of T. Janakiraman, who taught at the town high school.\n\n\u201cThe semi-rural and semi-urban nature of Kumbakonam provided perfect ambience for the writers,\u201d said poet Ravi Subramaniam, who had moved closely with Karichan and M.V. Venkatram.\n\nIn one of his works, Janakiraman recalls the nights they spent together at the Ku.Pa. Rajagopalan\u2019s house, discussing literature till the arrival of the Karichan, a small-sized songbird also known as \u2018Anachathan\u2019 and \u2018Bharadwajam,\u2019 in the wee hours. Ku.Pa.Ra. adopted the bird\u2019s name as his pen-name, \u2018Karichan.\u2019\n\nNarayanaswami, a school teacher and Sanskrit scholar, who considered himself a disciple of Ku.Pa.Ra, adopted the pseudonym \u2018Karichan Kunju.\u2019\n\nThe once-in-12-year Mahamaham festival also provided an opportunity for writers to buy rare books. \u201cIn his preface to Ma. Aranganathan\u2019s novel Kaaliyootu , S. Kandasamy has noted that Ka.Na.Su. had purchased many rare books during the festival,\u201d said L.S. Sathyamurthy, another writer from Kumbakonam.\n\nIndira Parthasarathy said he had also seen Janakiraman and others sitting on the ghats of the Mahamaham tank. \u201cI still remember Karichan Kunju praising the line \u2018Ottum irandulathin thattil arintheyn\u2019 by Subramanya Bharati. He stressed he had not come across such a beautiful rendering in Sanskrit literature,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was pure passion that drove them towards literature. \u201cM.V. Venkatram could have earned millions through his family\u2019s textile business. But he spent all his money on publishing books and lived in poverty,\u201d said Ravi Subramaniam.",
