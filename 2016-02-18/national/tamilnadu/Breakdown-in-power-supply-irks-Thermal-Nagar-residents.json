    "text": "Suspended air particles from the effluents of cooling tower NLC Tamil Nadu Power Limited (NTPL) at Thermal Nagar got deposited on power feeder lines of Muthaiyapuram substation and damaged the insulators, thus affecting power supply at night, said members of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).\n\nThey staged a demonstration at the entrance of Thermal Nagar Camp I on Wednesday evening. G. Mani Achari, district president of AITUC, who led the agitation, said that there were frequent power outages during night at Camp I of Thermal Nagar and nearby areas for the past one month. Normal life was affected for the residents in general and children in particular as they could not study and perishable goods kept in fridge were rendered unfit for consumption. A petition to sort out this issue was submitted to Collector M. Ravikumar on February 1, Mr. Achari said.\n\nThe service road along NH-Harbour Express Road had become a parking lot for trucks and indiscriminate parking of heavy vehicles was causing accidents. Trucks were parked on the service road from Thermal Nagar to Kovilpillai Nagar. Moreover, a Tasmac-run IMFL retail outlet was functioning close to the National Highway in violation of a court order that stipulated that liquor shops should be situated at least 250 metres away from NH.\n\nBesides, roads badly damaged by the November flood at Kovilpillai Nagar, Muthu Nagar and Kader Meeran Nagar had not been re-laid, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are frequent power outages during night hours for the past one month\u201d",
