    "text": "Five years after a name board in Tamil was erected in the Madras High Court Bench here amidst thunderous beating of \u2018 Thaarai and Thapattai ,\u2019 the court will now decide on its administrative side if there are any mistakes in the Tamil translation of its name.\n\nDisposing of a public interest litigation petition alleging as many as four mistakes, a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam said that the issue could be examined by the High Court administration for taking an appropriate decision within three months.\n\nThe judges, however, refused to issue a writ of mandamus directing the Registrar General of the High Court to correct the mistakes and change the name of the Bench on the board from \u2018 Madras Uyarneethimandram Madurai Kilai \u2019 (Madras HC Madurai Branch) to \u2018 Madras Uyarneethimandra Madurai Neel Irukkai \u2019 (Madras HC Madurai Extended Bench).\n\n\u201cIn all cases, literal translation cannot be made. All that is intended by erecting the name board is to convey to the general public, the establishment and existence of a Bench of the Madras High Court at Madurai. Hence, we are not inclined to issue a writ of mandamus,\u201d the court said. One of the two English name boards at the entrance to the High Court Bench was converted into Tamil after a group of lawyers sat on an indefinite hunger strike inside the court buildings in 2010 pressing various demands including declaration of Tamil as official language of the court.\n\nOn November 26, 2010, the then Chief Justice, M.Y. Eqbal, unveiled the Tamil name board in the presence of Justice F.M. Ibrahim Kalifulla, now a Supreme Court judge, who told the lawyers in the gathering that the Tamil word \u2018 Kilai \u2019 was chosen only after consultation with Tamil scholars.",
