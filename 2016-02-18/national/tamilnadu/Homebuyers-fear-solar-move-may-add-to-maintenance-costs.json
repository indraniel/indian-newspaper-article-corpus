    "text": "Regular maintenance, recurring expenditure and overall increase in project cost of an apartment are some of the concerns worrying flat owners and occupants.\n\nIndividual solar plant installers said that in the case of multi-storey buildings, especially in luxury projects and complexes with several dozen apartments, the increase in costs might be marginal, when the overall cost of the flat was factored in.\n\nHowever, in special buildings (ground plus four floors), homebuyers might feel the additional cost weighing down heavily on them.\n\n\u201cAsking buyers to pay an additional amount of Rs. 25,000 towards solar plants will be met with resentment,\u201d said V. Ravi Kumar, an engineer who has been in the field for about five years. Flat promoters and solar distributors recalled an earlier G.O. on the mandatory installation of solar water heaters in flats and sought to know whether the latest G.O. had taken that into consideration too.\n\nThe G.O. on solar water heating equipment in new buildings and marriage halls, passed in 2002, could not be enforced by the State government and they wondered how the planning agencies \u2014 Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and Directorate of Town and Country Planning\u2014could monitor and ensure compliance by several hundred buildings in the city and suburbs.\n\nA representative of a residents\u2019 association in a suburban apartment complex with over 100 homes said there was resistance from families, especially tenants, to the increasing maintenance costs every year.\n\nBe it building a sewage or grey water treatment plant or closed-circuit television camera network, it required a lot of money and the new proposal would only strain the budgets of families moving into new apartments henceforth.",
