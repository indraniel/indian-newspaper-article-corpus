It can inspire, motivate and retell the stories of love, affection, grit and courage living through the horrifying realities.\n\nThe students of Department of Electronic Media and Mass Communication in Pondicherry Central University have captured the hope and struggle of oppressed people emerging through challenges that life throws at them.\n\nThe eight-minute documentaries made by the students \u2013 \u2018Burns\u2019, \u2018Sangarsh\u2019 and \u2018Good day will not come\u2019 \u2013 were screened at the International Documentary and Short Film Festival in Pondicherry Central University.\n\nFrom a remote village in Jharkhand, Naina Kumari, a student in the Department of Electronic Media and Mass Communication at Pondicherry Central University, films the lives of a 62-year-old woman who struggles to meet the needs of her HIV-positive granddaughter.\n\nHaving lost her son and daughter-in-law to AIDS, Radhev Oraoh works in a farm to send her 11-year-old granddaughter to school. Though she has many grandchildren, she works to take care of this child. The camera just captures the life of the woman, filming the activities from going to the farm to taking her granddaughter to circus. \u201cShe was very shy to speak to us. Hence, we decided to film her routine activities and her relationship with the granddaughter and how the village has been supportive to this family,\u201d she said.\n\nNaina added that the grandmother never discriminates this child because she is HIV positive. \u201cShe is going to school and leading a normal life. Everyone in the village knows and do not discriminate against her. The documentary film \u2018Sangarsh\u2019 is about the struggle of the grandmother to give a normal life to a HIV positive granddaughter. The story is about treating everyone equal in society,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Burns\u2019, the documentary film, which was screened at the 5{+t}{+h}International Documentary and Short Film Festival, is about acid attack victims. Twenty-three-year old Ashika Kumar along with her classmate Unni Krishnan from the Department of Electronic Media and Mass Communication travelled to Bangalore to document the lives of acid attack victims.\n\n\u201cWe did not want to record how the beauty of a woman was destroyed due to acid attack. They are not just victims but survivors and determined to live. We wanted to document this positive aspect rather than talk about victimisation,\u201d says Ashika.\n\nThe eight-minute documentary \u2018Burns\u2019 is about the life of Pragya Singh. \u201cWe also recorded the legal aspects speaking to the activists groups in Bangalore,\u201d she said. They are planning interviews with acid attack victims in Chennai.\n\n\u201cWomen are becoming victims to acid attacks for refusing marriage or love proposals. Acid attack cases are increasing day by day around us. But some brave women victims of the acid attack fight back to live their normal life in the society. It is vital to talk about these issues and create awareness,\u201d she said.\n\nMuhammed Mubeen\u2019s documentary \u2018Good day will not come\u2019 focuses on malnutrition in Karnataka.",
