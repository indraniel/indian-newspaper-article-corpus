Baskar told reporters here on Wednesday.\n\nProf. Baskar, who is proficient in Tamil, English, Telugu and Japanese, firmly believes that knowledge of a foreign language would fetch them good jobs in the manufacturing hubs being established in the country by the Asian and European countries. The university would initiate discussion with consulates or embassies of those countries on modalities for establishing the centre on the lines of a similar facility functioning at Anna University in Chennai.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor said that the university would have tie-up with leading foreign universities and industries to bring foreign students and projects. \u201cThe 1.32 lakh Indian students studying in the universities of United States spend anywhere around Rs. 8,000 crore every year as tuition fee. If we can improve our infrastructure and the curriculum, we can also attract foreign students and projects,\u201d Prof. Baskar said.\n\nThe MSU would facilitate students\u2019 exchange programme with foreign universities, he said.",
