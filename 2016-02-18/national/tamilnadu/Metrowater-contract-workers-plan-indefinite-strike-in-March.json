    "text": "Contract workers of Chennai Metrowater, who have been complaining of being neglected for several years, plan to launch an indefinite strike from March if their demands are not met.\n\nMembers of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board Workers Association staged a demonstration recently demanding a hike in salary and better work timings. While 300 contract labourers are involved in cleaning sewer lines and manholes in the city, others are employed in sewage pumping stations and operation of jet-rodding machines.\n\nPointing out that the labourers continue to work in an unsafe environment, M. Palani, the Association\u2019s general secretary, complained that workers get only Rs.140 every day despite a directive to step up daily wages to Rs.293. \u201cWe have been fighting for our rights for three years now. We don\u2019t have any benefits like ESI or PF. Even if someone dies at work, the victim\u2019s family is not compensated properly,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers demand that the minimum monthly salary must be fixed at Rs. 15,000 and work shifts must be regularised as several of them work for over 14 hours a day.\n\nEach of the 200 wards has only three or four workers to attend to sewer complaints.\n\nBesides filling vacancies, contract workers must be given permanent jobs and proper safety gear at work. The Association members recently submitted a memorandum with their demand to Metrowater officials. They said that if their demands were not met, they will launch an indefinite strike from March.",
