Lakshmi narayanan\n\nWith the \u2018stop-purchase\u2019 agitation of the Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association (TNPDA) entering its third day on Wednesday, many petrol retail outlets in Salem and Namakkal regions have gone dry. However, the Association\u2019s protest demanding that lorry owners associations (LOA) in the Kongu region stop giving discounts, did not affect fuel outlets in Coimbatore region till Wednesday evening.\n\nOver 360 petrol bunks affiliated to the TNPDA situated in Salem, Namakkal, Karur, Krishnagiri, and Dharmapuri districts, did not lift their quota for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. Similarly, TNPDA members did not lift stock from oil company terminals in Coimbatore. This brings the total number of outlets participating in the stir to 700.\n\nIn Salem, panic-struck vehicle owners thronged fuel stations from the morning. Vehicle owners had to wait for more than an hour for getting their turn for filling the fuel.\n\nWith the TNPDA deciding to step-up the agitation, another 500 odd outlets in Karur region are expected to join the agitation on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner of Civil Supplies has scheduled a meeting for Thursday morning with representatives of oil companies, LOA and TNPDA.\n\n( with inputs from Deepa H.
