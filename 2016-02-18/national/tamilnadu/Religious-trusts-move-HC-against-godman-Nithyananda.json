    "text": "Three Salem-based religious trusts have approached the Madras High Court alleging that \u2018godman\u2019 Nithyananda is trying to grab the properties of the trusts through a \u2018dubious\u2019 suit.\n\nAdmitting the civil revision petition, Justice P.R. Shivakumar passed an interim stay against all further proceedings in the suit moved by Nithyananda pending before the Principal Sub Judge, Nagapattinam. According to the petitioners, the \u2018godman\u2019 has moved the suit seeking to declare him as the \u2018Madadhipathi\u2019 of Sri Somanatha Swami Temple and Mutt in Thiruvarur, Sri Po.Ka. Sathukkal Mutt in Vedaranyam, Sri Arunachal Gnanadesikar Swamigal Mutt in Panchanadhikulam, and Sri Palasamy and Sankarasamy Mutt in Thiruvarur. The petitioners alleged that Nithyananda has made the claim by wrongly projecting a donation to the tune of Rs. two crore that he gave for the mutts as financial assistance and projecting him as an administrator of the trusts. Granting the interim relief, the Judge ordered notice to Nithyananda returnable by March 14.",
