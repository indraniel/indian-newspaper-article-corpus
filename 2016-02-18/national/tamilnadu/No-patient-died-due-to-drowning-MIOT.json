    "text": "The Madras Institute of Orthopaedics and Trauma (MIOT) Hospital here, where 18 patients had died during the December floods, on Tuesday informed the Madras High Court that none of the deaths was caused due to drowning.\n\n\u201cPost-mortem conducted on the bodies at the government hospitals had not revealed any death due to drowning or under suspicious circumstances,\u201d said P.V.A. Mohandass, Managing Director of the hospital, in response to a public interest litigation petition alleging that there were more casualties due to lack of oxygen as the generators were marooned.\n\nDr. Mohandass said that the hospital building was constructed 10 metres above mean sea level and over 150 metres away from the banks of the Adayar. A breach in the Adayar had led to flooding.\n\nIn a separate affidavit, the Chennai Collector submitted that the hospital was not built on poromboke land and so the question of encroachment did not arise. Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh posted the matter to March 31 for further hearing.\n\nThe Chennai Collector stated that the hospital was not on poromboke land",
