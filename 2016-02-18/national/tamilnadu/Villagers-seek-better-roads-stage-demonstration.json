Gobi, members said that there are over 400 families residing at Kovilur village in Maramangalam Panchayat. The village is surrounded by dense forest and the presence of wild animals pose danger to the lives of people there. Even to fetch water, villagers need to travel 6 km on the mud roads that are in poor condition. Due to poor roads, villagers fear to use the roads and were forced to move only in groups so as to protect themselves from animal attacks. Hence, they needs tar-topped roads to their village.",
