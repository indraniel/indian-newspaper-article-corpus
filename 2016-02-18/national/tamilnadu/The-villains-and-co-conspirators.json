For instance, in Virudhunagar district, quacks seem to play a major role in the illegal practice, charging anywhere between Rs. 300 and Rs. 3,000 for administering a poisonous injection.\n\nIn Theni district, the practice is most often a ritual and generally happens \u201cwithin the four walls\u201d of the victim\u2019s home. Often, midwives or middlemen are \u201cemployed\u201d to commit the crime. In one instance, the study came across a person known as \u2018Society\u2019 who is generally hired by family members to kill the elderly.\n\nThe study also went into the socio-demographic profile of the victims, risk factors and causes, and examined different methods adopted to kill the elderly, the decision makers and whether geronticide was being practised as a ceremonial slaughter or ritual killing. Among the respondents, 67.8 per cent relied on agriculture and other related occupations.\n\n\u201cTo completely eradicate this practice, there must be a paradigm shift in the way the elderly are viewed. ; They should not be treated as a burden and we should acknowledge their economic and social contribution to society,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nIt further suggests stringent punishment for offenders under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.\n\n(Various methods adopted by the offenders to kill the elderly have not been disclosed intentionally)",
