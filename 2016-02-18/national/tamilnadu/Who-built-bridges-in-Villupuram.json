    "text": "The Assembly witnessed a lively debate on who should take credit for the bridges built in Villupuram district.\n\nWhile DMDK MLA representing Thirukoilur L. Venkatesan claimed that a particular bridge was being built only after his party leader (Vijayakant) wrote to the Centre, which has sanctioned Rs 20 crore now, State Highways Minister claimed the credit should fully go to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\nMeanwhile, Rural Industries Minister P. Mohan, who hails from the district, asked Mr. Venkatesan to mention the fact that the present government has built three other bridges which were the long-pending demand of the people.\n\nThe Treasury Bench also listed the allocations to the constituency in the past five years as the MLA complained of unfinished work in many projects and sought the town be upgraded as a municipality.\n\nHe also asked the government address the woes of sugarcane farmers as the private sugar mills were not giving them the State Advised Price for two years now. Villupuram district had a large number of cane farmers, he added. The DMDK MLA also asked the government to take note of the fact that the paddy farmers were also not getting the minimum support price.",
