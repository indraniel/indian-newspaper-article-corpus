One of the injured is said to be in a critical condition.\n\nThe victim was identified as B. Abinandana (21). Her brother B. Hariharan (19) and grandparents G. Elumalai (68) and Shanta (64), who were living with her, were also injured in the accident.\n\n\u201cThe young woman had 90 per cent burns. The young man\u2019s burns are 50 per cent, mostly on his back, but they are deep burns. He is in a critical condition,\u201d said Nirmala Ponnambalam, head of the burns and plastic surgery department at Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMC), where the three injured are undergoing treatment. The grandparents had also suffered burns, but not as badly as the youngsters.\n\nIt was believed that Shanta had not closed the valve of the gas cylinder before retiring to bed on Tuesday night. Without realising there was a gas leak, Abinandana, who woke up first, switched on a light in the kitchen, which could have sparked a fire that engulfed her first. Her grandparents and Hariharan, who went to her rescue, were also injured.\n\nPersonnel from the Fire and Rescue Services and police from Otteri police station rushed to the spot and took the injured to the hospital.\n\nOne of the victims has 90 per cent burns and the other suffered 50 per cent burns",
