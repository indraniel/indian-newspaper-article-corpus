A section of Opposition councillors however expressed disappointment alleging \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the selection of roads for development.\n\nAs per the plan, roads and lanes to a length of 36.87 km in various wards of the city will be developed under the Tamil Nadu Urban Road Infrastructure Programme (TURIP). Similarly, concrete roads to a length of 5.38 km will also be laid. The Corporation will use its general fund to implement the project in addition to the government subsidy. It will soon send the proposal for administrative sanction of Director of Municipal Administration.\n\nMayor A. Jaya said the plan would fulfil the long pending demand of residents and elected representatives of most of 65 wards in the city. The roads, which were five years old and badly damaged roads, had been selected for providing facelift. The roads would be re-laid with the paver machines.\n\nEarlier, the council witnessed heated exchange between the ruling AIADMK and the DMK members over the selection of roads for development. Most of the women councillors of DMK were up in arms, who levelled charges that the wards represented by the opposition councillors were not given due importance.\n\nKavitha Selvam (DMK) said that most of the roads in the 41{+s}{+t}ward were in bad condition and unfit for vehicle transport. The condition of the roads became worse in the recent rain. However, many of them were not included in the proposed plan.\n\nT.Muthuselvam (DMK) said that the Corporation had been following discriminative approach over selection of development works. While the wards represented by the AIADMK were given priority, the wards held by the DMK and other Opposition parties were given step motherly treatment.\n\nResponding to the charges, R.Gnanasekar, Chairman, K. Abhisekapuram zone, said that the Corporation had never followed a discriminative approach. All wards were being treated equally. The Opposition councillors had been levelling charges with ulterior motive, he charged.",
