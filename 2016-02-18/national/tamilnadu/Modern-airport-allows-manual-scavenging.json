It happens once a fortnight, and sometimes once a month, depending on the requirement. How can a practice that is banned be allowed?\u201d a source asked.\n\nAirport director Deepak Shastri said they had initiated steps to ensure this practice was stopped soon.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not right. The problem is that a section of the sewer lines have become too old and cannot be cleaned with machines. Hence, manual scavenging happens. But it happens only in a small area,\u201d he added. Since the operations are going on, on that stretch, the work to change the sewer lines cannot be done instantly, he added.\n\n\u201cThis practice is not routine and happens only once in a while,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly last month, four people, including three manual scavengers were asphyxiated while cleaning a septic tank in Okkiyum Thoraipakkam.",
