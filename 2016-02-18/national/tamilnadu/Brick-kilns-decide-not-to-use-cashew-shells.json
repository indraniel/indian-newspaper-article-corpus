Siva Saravanan\n\nBrick kilns in Thadagam area, number about 100, have decided not to use cashew shells as the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) recently issued show cause notice to six units.\n\nOne of the leading brick kiln owners told The Hindu on Wednesday the chimneys at the kilns are 110 feet to 120 feet high. At a recent meeting of the brick kiln owners, it was decided not to use cashew shells.\n\nEarlier, the units planned to stop purchase of roasted cashew shells from Kerala and to go in for raw cashew shells.\n\nHowever, it was decided at the meeting to seek approval from the TNPCB for use of raw cashew shells.\n\nTill then the units would use wood. They are also looking at feasibility of steam plants as it is said the cost of these is high.\n\nRegarding use of palm tree wood, the brick kiln owner said the Forest Department had warned the units several times against the use of wood from palm trees as it attracts elephants. However, some of the units continue to use these along with normal wood.\n\nAn official of the TNPCB said the six units have replied to the notice saying that they do not use cashew shells and the department officials would verify it before giving consent for the kilns to restart operations.\n\nHowever, these units do not have licence to operate and they need to get the licence too.",
