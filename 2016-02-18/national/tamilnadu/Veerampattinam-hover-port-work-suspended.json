The Coast Guard station in Puducherry will have two hovercraft next year. \u2014Photo: T. Singaravelou\n\nChief Minister N. Rangasamy on Wednesday announced that the works for construction of a hover port in the coastal hamlet of Veerampattinam had been temporarily suspended and that the government will not do anything that is against the interests of fishermen.\n\nTalking to reporters here, he said that fishermen had been agitating over the hover port citing that it would hamper their free movement and routine fishing activities. He sought to dispel their fears. The land for the proposed hover port had been acquired by the government and handed over to the Indian Coast Guard several years ago.\n\nMr. Rangasamy said that he would talk to the officials of the Indian Coast Guard and the Ministry concerned in the wake of the protests. The government would explore the option of shifting the project to an alternative site and till then the work would be kept in abeyance.\n\nOn delay in distribution of free mixers and grinders, he said that vested interests were trying to mislead the people for their own political gains. There was no truth in the allegation that the government was adopting a discriminatory approach in the distribution of freebies.\n\nIn fact, the government had drawn up a schedule to cover nine constituencies in Puducherry and one in Yanam under the scheme from February 18 to 29. On the demand for Statehood, the Chief Minister said he had already made a representation to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
