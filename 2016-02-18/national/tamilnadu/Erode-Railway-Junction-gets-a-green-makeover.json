Chinnasamy on Wednesday after it was formally inaugurated by the Divisional Railway Manager of Salem Division Shubhranshu, District Collector S. Prabakar, and S. Selvakumara Chinnaiyan, MP.\n\nThe dignitaries present on the occasion included Members of Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee S. Sivanesan and C.S. Gowthaman. Complimenting the OEF for beautifying the hitherto desolate spot, Mr. Shubhranshu promised that the railways would do its part to ensure that the park was maintained well.\n\n\u201cWe welcome other organisations to follow suit (for beautification of railway properties),\u201d he said.",
