Opinion polls by visual media should not attempt to change the mindset of people. There is mutual understanding among the constituents of the People\u2019s Welfare Front,\u201d the MDMK leader added.\n\nOn Minister\u2019s comments\n\nReacting to the \u201csarcastic comments\u201d made by Minister for Power R. Viswanathan against the PWF, Mr. Vaiko said that there was no confusion within the PWF. Chaos and confusion were only within the AIADMK.",
