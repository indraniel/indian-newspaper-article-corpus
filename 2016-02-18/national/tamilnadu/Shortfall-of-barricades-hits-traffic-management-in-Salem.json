Lakshmi narayanan\n\nWith the protests staged by government employees intensifying, the city police are facing a tough time in managing traffic due to shortfall of barricades.\n\nRecently, 14 barricades placed on the Junction Main Road, near AVR roundabout, to prevent vehicles from entering the service road near the petrol bunk in wrong direction. After the barricades were placed, vehicle entry was restricted and the road turned safe for vehicle users. However, on Wednesday, all the barricades were removed by the city police.\n\nProtests\n\nWhen contacted, senior traffic police officers said that based on a tip-off that protesting government employees have planned to block the National Highways, the barricades were removed and placed at other locations.\n\nThey said that the barricades will be placed back once the protests come to an end.\n\nSince most of the city roads were in poor condition due to the various ongoing works, barricades become necessary at many places to divert the vehicles and to prevent them from falling into pits. Those that were used for traffic management were relocated for this purpose.\n\nThe absence of barricades is creating chaos at many places in Salem city and the police are having a tough time in managing traffic.",
