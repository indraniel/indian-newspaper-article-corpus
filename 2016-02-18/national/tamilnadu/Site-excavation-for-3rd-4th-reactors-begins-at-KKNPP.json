    "text": "Excavation of the site for the third and fourth reactors of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) commenced on Wednesday.\n\nIn a simple ceremony held on Wednesday in the presence of the site director, KKNPP, R.S. Sundar, station director (units 3 and 4) P.A. Pillai and Chief Engineer M.S. Suresh, excavation of site commenced.\n\nAs the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), proponent of the project, has proposed to construct six reactors on the sprawling KKNPP site, it commenced the work on constructing the third and fourth reactors even as the first reactor reached the power generation phase and the second unit is waiting for enriched uranium fuel loading.\n\nOn completing the excavation before January 2017, the \u2018First Pouring of Concrete\u2019 for the third and fourth reactors will take place within a year from now.\n\n\u201cAs we have gained the much-needed experience on constructing the 1,000-MW VVER Russian reactors during the construction of the first two units, we have planned to complete the construction on an outlay of Rs. 39,747 crore and keep the new units ready for commissioning by 2022,\u201d said a senior official of KKNPP.\n\nAnti-people\n\nMeanwhile, S.P. Udhayakumar of the People\u2019s Movement Against Nuclear Energy, told reporters in Coimbatore, that the work to build the third and fourth reactors at KKNPP was anti-people.\n\nThe anti-nuke supporters would protest to prevent the construction of the two additional reactors, which if commissioned, would affect the life of people who lived in the reactor\u2019s vicinity.",
