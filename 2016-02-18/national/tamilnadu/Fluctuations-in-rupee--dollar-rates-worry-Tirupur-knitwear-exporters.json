With rupee weakening against the dollar, the cost of production automatically goes up and profit margins shrink\u201d, pointed out M. Veluswamy, apparel exporter and chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (Tirupur district council). Adding to the worries, a large chunk of foreign buyers ask the exporters here to pass on the benefits of price margins to them every time the rupee depreciates against the dollar little taking into consideration the increase happened to the overall production costs.\n\nS. Dhananjayan, chartered accountant and industry consultant, feels that Reserve Bank of India should intervene immediately to arrest any further decline by utilising various monetary tools and options.\n\n\u201cThis is very important to bring back stability in currency markets and for boosting the confidence of the industry\u201d, he said.",
