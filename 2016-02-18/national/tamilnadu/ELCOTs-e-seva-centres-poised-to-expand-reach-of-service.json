    "text": "The e-seva centres being operated in the district by ELCOT are poised to expand their range of services. At present, the centres are equipped to issue certifications of Revenue and Social Service Departments, PAN Card, printouts of Aadhaar Cards, receive applications for passport, enrol people in National Digital Literacy Mission, effect patta change, collect LIC premium, and carry out DTH recharge, mobile recharge, and bus ticket bookings.\n\nIn due course, the seven e-seva centres could be approached for registration of candidacy to appear for Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, and VAO exams, District Collector S. Prabakar said.\n\nThe centres at District Collectorate, Corporation Office, Bhavani Municipal Office and the four panchayat offices at Kathirampatti, Perodu, Konamulai and Elavamalai have, to a large extent, spared the people of the trouble of travelling to taluk offices and the collectorate for the certifications.",
