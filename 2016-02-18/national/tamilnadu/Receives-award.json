The highlight of this achievement is that the Salem branch is winning this award for the tenth consecutive year without any break.\n\nThis prestigious award has been conferred on the Salem branch of the ICAI taking into account the innumerable motivation seminars it organised for the budding chartered accountants, special programmes for the members of the Southern India Chartered Accountants Students Association (SICASA), and also for the school students to attract and motivate them to take up chartered accountant course.\n\nGuided by the parent body, the SICASA, the Salem branch\u2019s student committee bagged the best SICASA award in the small branch category at the national level for the second time in a row.\n\nBoth the awards were presented by Jayant Sinha, Union Minister of State for Finance, at the 66th annual function of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India held at New Delhi recently.",
