VIMAL KUMAR\n\nTension prevailed for sometime on Corporation office premises on Wednesday after overhead tank operators, conservancy workers and drivers who were merged into the Corporation staff core from eight panchayats and two municipalities laid siege to Commissioner\u2019s office.\n\nThe workers, along with trade unionists from CITU, resorted to the agitation alleging that despite been absorbed as corporation staff by the government about four years back, the workers were still given consolidated monthly pay ranging between Rs. 2,000 and Rs 4,000.\n\n\u201cAuthorities have been giving false promises for the past three years that the around 200 workers from the merged local bodies too will be given wages on a par with the other corporation workers of the same rank\u201d, R. Murugesh, a water tank operator, told The Hindu .\n\nThe corporation officials then tried in vain to convince the workers and the trade union leaders that the decision on giving revision of wages on a par with the other staff lies with the State Government.\n\n\u201cThe officials have been telling this for a long time. But nothing happened and each time the officials state some vague excuses like there has been some delay in files moving from one department to another for not getting the wages revised\u201d, said CITU Assistant District Secretary K. Rangaraj.\n\nArrested\n\nAs the workers and the trade unionists refused to move away, the city police arrested a total of 85 persons and removed them from the spot.",
