    "text": "After a long wait, Victoria Extension Road here is being re-laid. The work started on Wednesday and is expected to end in a day or two, corporation sources said.\n\nResidents were frustrated over the poor condition of the road, which was ignored for over two months. After completing this work,\n\nBeach Road would be re-laid, the sources said. Barricades have been erected near vegetable market on VE Road owing to the road work.\n\nPeople complain that George Road is also bad and must be included in the re-laying exercise. But, since this road is being maintained by the Highways Department, it must re-lay it.\n\nMayor A.P.R. Anthony Grace inspected the re-laying work on VE Road.",
