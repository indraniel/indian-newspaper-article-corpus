GOVARTHAN\n\nResidents in and around Vijayamangalam Railway Station have a cause for relief, as they will have a sub-way in due course at the level crossing close by.\n\nOn Wednesday, Divisional Railway Manager of Salem Division Shubhranshu and Erode District Collector S. Prabakar inspected the location where the sub-way has been planned.\n\nThe sub-way has been a long-felt need for residents in the surrounding villages since as many as 100 trains pass through the line every day, forcing people to halt as many times. The facility will come up at an expenditure of Rs. 2.5 crore, the DRM said, adding that tender would be floated shortly for the project.\n\nStation building\n\nEarlier, the DRM commissioned the station building renovated at a cost of Rs. 75 lakh in the presence of Tirupur MP V. Sathyabama and Mr. Prabakar.\n\nSubsequently, they visited the Perundurai Railway Station and explored scope for construction of bridge.\n\nThe existing sub-way was insufficient to cater to the increasing number of vehicles, official sources said.",
