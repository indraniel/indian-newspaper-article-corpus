    "text": "The online service of the postal department is now actively encouraging customers to send messages on special occasions to their loved ones, via e-posts. In the e-post system, messages that are electronically generated are sent to the delivery post office and printouts are delivered to recipients. Each message costs Rs.10.\n\nThe service, which is available in post offices for over seven years now, is popular among those who want to send birthday greetings to political leaders and actors and also among the corporates that want to send messages to their customers.\n\nKeeping in line with this, the Department of Posts has announced that all post offices will accept birthday greetings to Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa through e-posts. Special arrangements have been made to deliver the greetings to postal address 81/36, Veda Nilayam, Poes Garden, Chennai-86 with the sender\u2019s name.\n\nPeople could also send greetings through customised \u2018My Stamp\u2019 from Philatelic Bureau, Anna Road HPO. Similarly, greetings could also be sent by speed post. Last year, 10,000 e-posts were delivered by post offices.",
