    "text": "Arrest of Principal, faculty member demanded\n\nA 21-year-old college student, P. Anandraj of Vetriyilaiyoorani, allegedly committed suicide by self-immolation at his house on Wednesday afternoon after he was reprimanded by college authorities on disciplinary grounds.\n\nPolice said that the Dalit youth had doused himself with petrol and set himself afire around 2 p.m. when his parents were away. He died on the spot. The police said that Anandraj, a third year undergraduate student of English Literature at Madurai Kamaraj University Constituent College in Sattur, was irregular to classes.\n\nHe missed the second day session of a seminar held at a college in Virudhunagar on February 11 and 12. A faculty member, Gnanaselvakumar, complained about his behaviour with Principal Mahendran. On being summoned, Anandraj\u2019s mother met the Principal on Tuesday.\n\nThe Principal complained about his activities to his mother. He wanted her to advise her son to be regular to classes and behave properly with the faculty, Sivakasi Deputy Superintendent of Police A.C. Vellaiyan, who is in-charge of Sattur sub-division, said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the boy committed suicide. Students of the college, relatives and cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi staged a protest demanding the arrest of the Principal and the faculty member. Though post-mortem was conducted at Sattur Government Hospital, the family members refused to receive the body demanding immediate action. Vembakottai police have registered a case of unnatural death.",
