Bharati, DMK party organisation secretary. It asked the police that the persons behind these posters be brought to book.\n\n\u201cEven the Constitution of India does not provide limitless freedom of expression. Article 19 (2) imposes restrictions on such freedom, which specifically prevents an action inciting to an offence,\u201d said the complaint.",
