Ganesan was on his way to the Chennai airport from his village in Cuddalore district, when the bus he was on met with a head-on collision at Muttukadu on Sunday. In the few minutes that followed, the 48-year-old\u2019s life was irrevocably changed.\n\n\u201cI was heading to the airport to board a flight to Saudi Arabia to take up a construction job,\u201d said Ganesan, an agricultural labourer. \u201cMy wife and daughter were accompanying me, to drop me at the airport,\u201d he said, at Government Royapettah Hospital, where he is waiting for a surgery for his broken left leg.\n\nGanesan\u2019s wife and daughter, said his older brother R. Sekar, have also been admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. His wife Parameshwari suffered injuries to both her legs, and his teenage daughter Geetha\u2019s right leg has been amputated below the knee. This was to be Ganesan\u2019s first job abroad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much work in our village, so he decided to go abroad and work. He got the job through an agent,\u201d said Sekar.\n\nEverything was ready on Sunday. \u201cI had my passport and ticket with me. My flight was at 8 p.m.,\u201d said Ganesan.\n\nA doctor at the hospital said both bones in Ganesan\u2019s lower leg were broken, and he was being assessed for surgery.\n\nYouth suffers fractures\n\nAt Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospial, a doctor said 19-year-old Geetha had suffered multiple fractures on her right leg. \u201cThere was no pulsation and it had to be amputated through the knee,\u201d she said. Geetha also suffered fractures in both arms. Parameshwari had bones in both legs fractured and was due to undergo surgery on Monday, she said.\n\nAfter the surgeries have been completed and the family has recovered to some extent, Sekar plans to take them home. On what happens with his job next, Ganesan said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to go abroad at all now.\u201d\n\nTwo other women and one man have also been admitted to the orthopaedics ward at Government Royapettah Hospital. K. Saraswathi, daughter of M. Gunabhushani, said she had been called by a stranger who informed her that her mother was in hospital. \u201cHer phone and purse were then stolen. But, I don\u2019t mind because at least they told me about my mother,\u201d said the 37-year-old, adding that her mother was coming to visit her in the city from Puducherry.\n\nAnother woman, admitted for surgery, was pregnant and had gone to the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for a check-up, a doctor said. Nine other victims of the accident were at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Sunday. Of these, two have been discharged and the other seven are undergoing treatment, a doctor said.",
