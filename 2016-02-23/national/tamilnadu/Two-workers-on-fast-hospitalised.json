Ponnusamy (47) and A. Velakanni (45), overhead water tank operators.\n\nAround 200 workers, who were absorbed as Corporation staff by the government about four years ago following the merger, were still given consolidated monthly pay ranging from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 4,000. This prompted them to go on fasting.",
