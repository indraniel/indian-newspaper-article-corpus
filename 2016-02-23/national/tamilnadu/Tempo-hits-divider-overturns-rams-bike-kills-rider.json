The assistant, Muniswamy (31), had a miraculous escape as he managed to jump off the moving motorcycle in the nick of time.\n\nAccording to the police, the incident occurred around 1.15 p.m. when Mahadevaiah, who had gone to Kunigal for some work, was returning to his house in Hongasandra.\n\nThe driver of the tempo traveller is said to have lost control while overtaking a car and rammed into the divider.\n\nOn impact, the vehicle turned turtle and crashed into Mahadevaiah\u2019s motorcycle on the other side of the road. The tempo traveller driver fled as passers-by gathered and alerted the traffic police.\n\nMahadevaiah\u2019s body and the crushed motorcycle were found when a crane pulled the truck up.\n\nTraffic in and around the flyover was disrupted for over an hour.\n\nThe Kamakshipalya police have registered a hit-and-run case and efforts are on to nab the driver.",
