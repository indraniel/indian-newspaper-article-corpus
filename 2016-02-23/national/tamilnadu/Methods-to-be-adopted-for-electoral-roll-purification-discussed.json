    "text": "Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Monday discussed the steps to be taken for purification of electoral rolls with designated election officials and agents of recognized political parties on Monday.\n\nIt had been identified earlier that there are roughly 15,000 entries in the electoral rolls across ten assembly constituencies in the district which had to be removed. These entries correspond to names of deceased persons, duplicate entries and entries of those who have migrated to other places. The purification exercise which commenced with a similar meeting last Monday was targeted to be finished by February 29, 2016.\n\nIn the meeting on Monday, officials said that it was decided to obtain the list of deceased persons registered with the Registrar\u2019s office from the year 2006 till 2016, which will be cross checked with the electoral roll.\n\nIt was also decided to use software tools prepared by the Election Commission to identify duplicate entries at part level in the electoral rolls.\n\nCollector Veera Raghava Rao had ordered for a meeting to be convened coming Wednesday at booth level in the presence of Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and Booth Level Agents (BLAs) for the purification exercise.\n\nBLAs have also been asked to submit Form 7 (for removal of entries) for those duplicates that have been identified by them so far.\n\nAfter verification\n\nThe entries will be removed after appropriate verification by BLOs.",
