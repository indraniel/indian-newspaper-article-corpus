Kalathur to Manachanallur has been responsible for killing many snakes in the area, according to a recent study.\n\nQ. Ashoka Chakkaravarthy, wildlife biologist and assistant professor of Environmental Science, Department Of Foundation Courses, St. Joseph\u2019s College, who conducted the study, said most of the killing occurred in the monsoon months from November to January, along a 27-km stretch of road. \u201cThe most troubling sight was to find snakes that are arboreal (tree-dwelling) in nature lying dead by the roadside,\u201d said Mr. Chakkaravarthy.\n\nReptile on road\n\n\u201cIf the canopy of trees lining the road had not been disturbed, they would have crossed over without coming down. \u201cIn the monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter months the road is a lot warmer than the forest floor so they must have been drawn to the tar roads,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother reason for the high snake mortality rate could be due to the breeding season that coincides with the monsoon, said Mr. Chakkaravarthy. Species such as common krait, Russell\u2019s viper, saw-scaled viper and rat snakes are most at risk, if not from traffic, then from being illed when they enter human habitations, said Mr. Chakkaravarthy.\n\n\u201cReptiles and amphibians are known to be the most affected by vehicular traffic, but there is very little information available on such accidents,\u201d he added.",
