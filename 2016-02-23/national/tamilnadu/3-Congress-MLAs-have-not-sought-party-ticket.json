Thirumurugan and Malladi Krishna Rao have not submitted any application seeking to contest on party tickets in the forthcoming elections.\n\nRecently estranged senior Congress MLA and former Minister Mr. Djeacoumar declared that he would contest in Villianur constituency as Congress party candidate and would also field his supporters in Mangalam and Ossudu constituencies.\n\nMr. Djeacoumar has been avoiding the party platforms in the recent past citing personal reasons. His overture towards the ruling AINRC raised many eyebrows a few months ago. He is at present representing the Mangalam constituency.\n\nOther MLAs- Malladi Krishna Rao and P.R.N.Thirumurugan of Karaikal(North) too have been avoiding the party platforms for long.\n\nHowever, Pradesh Congress Committee president A .Namassivayam has said that the Congress high command had the powers to give ticket to a person, even if he did not submit an application.\n\nMeanwhile, 280 applications were submitted from all regions of UT and more than 25 members each gave application to contest in Villianur, Nellithoppe, Ossudu and Thirubuvanai constituencies.",
