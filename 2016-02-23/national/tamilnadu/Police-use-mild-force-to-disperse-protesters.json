    "text": "Police had to use mild force to disperse a group of people who staged a road roko near CSI Cathedral on the busy Thiruvananthapuram High Road on Monday that disrupted traffic for more than 15 minutes.\n\nAfter a bus shelter near the Cathedral was recently shifted to a nearby spot opposite Mary Sargent Girls\u2019 Higher Secondary School for the benefit of the students, members of a few Hindu outfits opposed it. However, buses were stopped only at the new spot.\n\nProtesting it, a group of people from Vengu Mudaliar Street (now known as Thevarpiraan Street) staged a road roko. They, led by a law college girl student, demanded that the bus-shelter should be brought back to the old spot.\n\nWhen the police held talks with the protestors even as a few hundred vehicles, including the car carrying District Revenue Officer M.G. Kuldandaivel, queued up on both sides, the protestors refused to give up their agitation.\n\nTo disperse the protestors, the police used mild force and the traffic was restored. Two persons have been picked up by the police for interrogation.",
