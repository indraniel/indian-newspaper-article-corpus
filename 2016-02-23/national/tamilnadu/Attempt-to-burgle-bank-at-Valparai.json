The incident came to light only on Monday.\n\nAccording to the Valparai police, three miscreants targeted a bank functioning from the first floor of a private complex around 11 a.m. The accused had brought three gas cylinders to break open the safe, which had around Rs. 20 lakh cash and jewellery worth Rs. 15 crore in two bureaus.\n\nFollowing inability to break open the safe, they left the cylinders and cutters at the crime spot.\n\nFinger print experts and sniffer was also pressed into service.\n\nThe Valparai police registered a case under Sections 380 (theft) and 457 (trespass to commit an offence) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nPolice said that images of three persons making their attempt were recorded in a CCTV camera. The accused later disconnected a cable connecting the CCTV camera before they made their way in.\n\nThe not-very- clear footage showed that two of them covered their face with a mask and a cap.\n\nInquiries are under way.",
