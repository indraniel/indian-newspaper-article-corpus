    "text": "The national general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), P. Muralidhar Rao, said that on Monday that the party was not in competition with anyone for \u2018kingship\u2019.\n\nThe remarks came two days after Mr. Vijayakant solicited the views of his cadres on alliance at the party\u2019s rally in Kancheepuram. A significant section of the crowd wanted him to be the \u2018king\u2019 and not the \u2018kingmaker\u2019.\n\nWhen asked about the development, Mr. Rao said there was nothing wrong in Mr. Vijayakant wanting to be the \u2018king\u2019.\n\nHowever, he added that the BJP was not competing with anyone for being the \u2018king\u2019. \u201cLong back we had told that the BJP was not specific about retaining the kingship,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why there was no commitment from the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam for an alliance, Mr. Rao said the fact that Mr. Vijayakant had not committed to anyone means he had not said no to the BJP.\n\n\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t formally say no and as long as we formally do not say no, there is hope on both sides. There no inferior or superior party here,\u201d he pointed out.",
