Led by B. Ayyanapillai, district president of the association, they urged the state government to rectify certain anomalies in the New Health Insurance scheme. They wanted cent per cent re-imbursement of medical expenditure. They said that private hospitals and notified hospitals should not collect hospital treatment fees over and above the eligibility under insurance cover. Relatives of the retired personnel particularly mother, farther, unmarried son and daughter should be covered under the insurance benefits.",
