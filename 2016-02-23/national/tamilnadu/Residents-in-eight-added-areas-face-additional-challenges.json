    "text": "Many birth and death records in the added areas have reportedly been misplaced.\n\nFollowing the merger of these areas with the Greater Chennai Corporation, many residents there have had the frustrating experience of being told that the birth and death records of their loved ones were missing.\n\nBefore the merger, these records were maintained by the revenue department.\n\n\u201cData with the Corporation is incomplete. So, the issuance of birth and death certificates has become more challenging for residents of the erstwhile 42 local bodies that were merged with the city in 2011,\u201d said a Corporation official.\n\nHe added that residents in the added zones of Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Ambattur, Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Perungudi and Sholinganallur have not been able to get changes made in their birth certificates .\n\n\u201cMany illiterate residents in the added areas visit zonal offices to get printouts of birth and death certificates. But officials are unable to help them. Many zonal offices do not have a printer. The facilities should be available in ward offices also,\u201d said Congress councillor P. V. Tamil Selvan.\n\nThe problem is compounded as much of the birth and death data, maintained by the revenue departments of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts, are yet to be handed over to the Greater Chennai Corporation.\n\nIn these newly merged zones, there have been difficulties in locating many birth and death records",
