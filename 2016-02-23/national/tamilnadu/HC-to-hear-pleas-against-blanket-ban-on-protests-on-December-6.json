Manikumar and C.T. Selvam agreed to hear both the appeals together on Wednesday when one of them, filed by K. Shahul Hameed, Madurai district president of Popular Front of India, came up for hearing on Monday. The appellants challenged the order on the ground that it had been passed in violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression.\n\nJustice S. Vaidyanathan had passed the order while disposing of a writ petition filed by an office-bearer of the Hindu Munnani seeking permission to hold a demonstration in Dindigul on December 6 last year demanding construction of a Ram temple at the site in Ayodhya where the 16th century mosque was demolished in 1992.\n\nFinding no justification in the plea made by the petitioner organisation, the judge said that the agitation would not fetch any fruitful result but for satisfying its ego.\n\nHowever, since Dindigul police had already granted permission to two Muslim organisations \u2014 Popular Front of India and Indian National League \u2014 to hold demonstrations condemning the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6, the judge directed the officials to consider petitioner\u2019s plea too.\n\n\u201cIn the event of the respondents declining the request of the petitioner, they must record reasons and grounds for such rejection and in the said order, they should also justify their stand for having granted permission to two other organisations,\u201d the judge said.\n\nHe went on to direct the police to record on video the demonstration of the two Muslim organisations and ordered the Home Secretary and the Director General of Police to issue a circular, within a month, instructing all their subordinates not to grant permission for demonstrations and rallies on December 6 from 2016.",
