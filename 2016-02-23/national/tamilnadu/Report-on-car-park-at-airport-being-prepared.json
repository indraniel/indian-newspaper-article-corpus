    "text": "Airport Authority of India (AAI) has finalised a consultant to plan the construction of a multi-level car parking at the Chennai airport. Initially, the firm Jones Lang LaSalle will submit a feasibility report based on an evaluation of various aspects and give recommendations for the construction of the car parking facility.\n\nAirport director Deepak Shastri said, \u201cWe are looking at a capacity of 3,000 cars and also a commercial complex near this facility. After the consultant submits the report, we will call for tenders and then the work will begin. We plan to complete it in about 18 months.\u201d\n\nHe said that the discussions had started in this regard and the report would be complete in a while.\n\nSources said the consultant would complete the study in four months; a preliminary report would be presented first after which the final one would be submitted.\n\n\u201cThe study will include suggestions on the type of multi-level car parking and pricing strategy. The decision on the site where the facility will come up is yet to be finalised,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe plan to construct a multi-level car park was mooted several years ago owing to various reasons, but was revived subsequently.\n\nThe existing car park area of the airport sprawled over 46,300 square metres, officials said.",
