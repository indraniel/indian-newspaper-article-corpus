    "text": "The Public Information Officer (PIO) of the Madras High Court Bench here has refused to furnish information sought for by an advocate under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, since \u201cit is not readily available and collection of the same involves verification of voluminous records and huge manpower which is not possible.\u201d\n\nK.H. Elavazhagan, Registrar (Administration)-cum-PIO of the Bench, had said so in a written reply sent to the RTI applicant, A. Kannan, who had sought details of private cases filed by law officers representing the State government before their appointment to the posts of Special Government Pleader, Additional Public Prosecutor and Government Advocate in June 2011.\n\nThe applicant had sought the information probably to prove the common complaint of law officers being appointed mostly on the basis of their affiliation to the political party in power than on merit and standing in the Bar.",
