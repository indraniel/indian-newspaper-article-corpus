But none of them were followed by the organisers on Sunday.\n\nAIADMK Legislature Party Deputy Leader A.Anbalagan said the young boy died due to the negligence of the amateur athletic association and lax attitude of the government. He also said when over 750 students were participating in the event, there was no doctor, ambulance and first-aid team to render any medical assistance.\n\n\u201cIt is not right on the part of the government to have permitted the event when there is no proper athletic track.
