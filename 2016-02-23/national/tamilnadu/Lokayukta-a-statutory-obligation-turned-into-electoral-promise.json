    "text": "A promise made by DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Sunday to establish Lokayukta for dealing with complaints related to corruption against certain public functionaries in the State, if his party was elected to power in the Assembly elections, has led to the need to trace out the reasons for a statutory obligation having turned into an electoral promise.\n\nIt was during the Congress rule at the Centre that the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 was enacted and brought into force on January 1, 2014 after receiving the President\u2019s assent on the same day.\n\nAs per Section 3 of the Act, the chairperson and members of Lokpal should be selected by a committee led by the Prime Minister and comprising four members, including the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nHowever, the May 2014 general elections led to a conundrum with no opposition party winning at least 55 seats (10 per cent) in the Lok Sabha to stake claim for the post of Leader of the Opposition. It led to the need for amending the Lokpal Act.\n\nThough nearly 20 months had passed since then, the amendment still \u201cremains in the stage of proposal and not yet finalised\u201d as per a submission made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan before the Madras High Court Bench here early this month.\n\nThe submission was made before a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam who were seized of two public interest litigation petitions accusing the State government of not taking steps to establish Lokayukta despite Section 63 making it mandatory for all State governments to establish such bodies within one year from the date of commencement of the Act.\n\nOpposing the PIL petitions, Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian claimed that the State government had acted promptly and constituted a committee to draft a Bill on Lokayukta but the process was put on hold in view of proposed amendments to the Central Act and to prevent the State legislation turning out to be repugnant to the amended Act.\n\nAccepting his submissions, the Division Bench said: \u201cThe contention of the petitioners that the State government has not taken any steps to establish Lokayukta cannot be accepted. Till the proposed amendments to the Central Act are finalised, no direction can be issued\u2026Accordingly, the writ petitions are disposed of.\u201d",
