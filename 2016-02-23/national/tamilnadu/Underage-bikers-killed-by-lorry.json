    "text": "Despite the police warning parents not to allow their under-aged children to drive vehicles, the trend continues unabated.\n\nThe latest victims are two 16-year-olds who died after their motorcycle was hit by a lorry on the Puzhal-Madhuravoyal by-pass road on Saturday morning. Another teenager is battling for life at Stanley Medical College hospital.\n\nAccording to officials, Tamil Selvan (16), Saran (16) and Sushin (16) were studying in class X at a private school in Madhavaram, where the three live. On Saturday morning, they decided to pay their friend a visit.\n\n\u201cTamil Selvan took his father Umapathy\u2019s motorcycle and picked up the other two. When they on a flyover, a lorry came from behind and hit their vehicle. Tamil Selvan and Saran died on the spot and Sushin was rushed to Stanley Medical College hospital for treatment,\u201d said a police officer attached to the Madhavaram police station.\n\nThe police have seized the lorry. The driver is however absconding. \u201cWe are trying to locate him,\u201d said the police officer. \u201cThe road is dangerous due to lorry traffic and fast-moving vehicles. At least three accidents take place every week,\u201d added the officer.\n\n\u201cThey cannot handle such a vehicle,\u201d said a senior police officer. According to Provision 1 in Section 4 of the Motor Vehicles Act, \u201cno one under the age of 18 years can drive a motor vehicle unless the engine capacity is not exceeding 50 cc and the driver is 16 years of age.\u201d \u201cWe can only create awareness and take action against those who flout the law. Parents and schools have an equal role to play in preventing schoolchildren from riding motorcycles,\u201d said an officer.",
