Hyder Ali seeking a direction to the RBI to issue an order/circular to all banks in Chennai, Kancheepuram, and Thiruvallur districts exempting those who availed themselves of loans from paying the EMI for next six months and also not to levy any penal interest for six months in view of the recent deluge.\n\nAccording to a Master Circular dated December 18, 2015 submitted by the RBI re-scheduling of existing loans in the flood-affected areas of Tamil Nadu has been allowed. Housing loans will get one-year moratorium. Vehicle, educational, and consumer loans have been given six months moratorium.\n\nTop-up loans up to 25 per cent of the existing loan amount will be provided to customers who need assistance to carry out repair/ renovation works in their house. Recording the submission, the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M Sundresh, noting that the proposal of the petitioner stands adopted, closed the PIL plea.",
