After police personnel pacified the woman , she submitted a petition to the Collector.\n\nIn her petition, Ms. Vasantha said that she had applied for the post of mid day meal organiser at a school in Ettayapuram taluk. She had sought priority to her in view of the mental condition of her daughter. But, a woman of the same locality, who was in possession of a family card showing her as a resident of Kailasapuram in Ottapidaram taluk, was appointed to the post.\n\nThe Collector told the woman that no malpractice was allowed and noon meal scheme appointments were made as per rules and regulations. However, her complaint would be looked into, he added.",
