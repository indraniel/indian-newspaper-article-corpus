    "text": "A symposium on women\u2019s oncology at Apollo Hospitals here on Monday had experts from the hospital, the National Cancer Institute, the U.S., and the Cancer Institute, Adyar, sharing their experiences.\n\nThe symposium, aimed at educating people on newer treatments, vaccinations and screening processes, deliberated on prevention and management of the disease.\n\nApollo Hospitals\u2019 executive vice-chairperson Preetha Reddy said, \u201cOver six lakh people die of cancer every year in India and more than half of them are in the 30-70 age group. This symposium will provide opportunities for oncologists to interact with one another and exchange latest updates on cancer prevention and treatment.\u201d\n\nDr. Reddy said the need of the hour was a collective movement from public and private organisations to increase awareness of proactive screening for NCDs.\n\nAdyar Cancer Institute chairperson V. Shanta said the lifetime cumulative risk of women aged below 75 years acquiring cancer in urban areas in India is one in seven to 10 whereas in developed countries it was one in three or four.\n\nShe said nearly 60 per cent of patients seek treatment in advanced stages leading to increased mortality and poor survival. Dr. Shanta said a thrust on preventive measures with early detection, education and increasing awareness will reduce the number of cancer incidences.\n\nA discussion on a road map towards women\u2019s oncology care in the country was moderated by T. Raja, medical oncologist at Apollo Cancer Hospitals. Later, a panel discussion to emphasise healthy living was held.",
