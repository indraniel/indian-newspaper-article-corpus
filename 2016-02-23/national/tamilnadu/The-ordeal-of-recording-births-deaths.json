The Corporation Commissioner is the district registrar for births and deaths. Following a scrutiny of complaints pertaining to registration of births and deaths, the Chief Registrar has found that the public could be possibly facing difficulty in having access to the registrar for registration of birth and death.\n\nThe Chief Registrar has warned the Corporation that \u201cviolation of the legitimate duty of the Birth and Death Registrar\u201d would attract penal action against the registrar as per Section 23 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1969.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the Chief Registrar has stipulated that each sanitary inspector have an office at the local area and meet the public from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. to register birth and deaths on a daily basis. The sanitary inspector should also be proactive in registering births and deaths in his area without omission by utilising the services of notifiers. Each of the hospitals notifies the events of births and deaths to the Chennai Corporation\u2019s health department.\n\n\u201cThe sanitary inspector responsible for omission will be penalised for any omission as per Section 23 of the Act,\u201d said an official of Chennai Corporation.",
