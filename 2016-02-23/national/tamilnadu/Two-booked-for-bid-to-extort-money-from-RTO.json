Singaravel, and demanding money.\n\nThe S.S. Colony police have identified the other accused as S. Prem alias Premanand (32) of Valanthur, who was arrested in the extortion of an hotelier, along with one Mahamuni. The police said that the advocate had gone to the RTO\u2019s office with a petition seeking information under Right to Information Act about the functioning of the RTO (South) office by employing outsiders to take care of daily routine work.\n\nHe said that Prem would drop the RTI petition, if they were paid.\n\nHowever, the RTO had ignored their threat. Meanwhile, the police who arrested Prem, Gubendran and Mahamuni in connection with the extortion of a hotelier found in their possession the petition addressed to the RTO.\n\nWhen the police sought clarification about the issue, the RTO lodged a complaint about the incident that is said to have occurred on February 15.
