    "text": "Owing to the replacement of radioactive isotopes, radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients will be suspended for about ten days at Government Rajaji Hospital.\n\nAccording to Dean M.R. Vairamuthu Raju, the radioactive Cobalt-60 material loaded about ten years before has already crossed its half-life cycle and is due for replacement.\n\nConcerns have already been raised about the ineffectiveness of the radiotherapy treatment due to ageing of the radioactive material at the hospital.\n\nDr. Raju said that the material was presently being transported from the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai. Hospital sources said that the loading of new material would also require minor alteration to the Oncology department building in GRH.\n\nDr. Raju said that the cancer patients who came for radiotherapy had been advised about the delay and revised dates for radiotherapy sessions had been communicated to them.",
