    "text": "The Nallur Consumer Welfare Association (NCWA) is all set to move court seeking for a ban on all road blockade agitations and demonstrations within Tirupur city limits. Prior to moving the court, the Association on Monday gave a memorandum highlighting the demand to the District Collector as a formality.\n\n\u201cWe are moving court as the road blockade agitations held by thousands of government employees and a few other groups of people in the recent days have literally brought the city to a standstill. Traffic disruption near the Old Bus Stand following the road blockade agitation by the government staff had a chain reaction affecting the traffic across the city for many hours. Even patients could not be taken in ambulances due to this,\u201d NCWA president N. Shanmugasundaram told The Hindu .\n\nSimilar is the case with demonstrations allowed by the police near the Corporation office. Here too, traffic need to be either diverted or regulated causing blocks in many roads as the city was already congested, he added.\n\nActivists were already of the opinion that the right of the political parties or employees\u2019 associations to stage agitations should not come at the expense of the rights of the other people to move freely. According to Mr. Shanmugasundaram, the officials of various departments should sit together to finalise new designated spots for holding demonstrations and fasts.\n\n\u201cAs far as road blockade agitations, we are of the view that it should not be allowed even for a second. People involved in that should be arrested and remanded,\u201d he said.",
