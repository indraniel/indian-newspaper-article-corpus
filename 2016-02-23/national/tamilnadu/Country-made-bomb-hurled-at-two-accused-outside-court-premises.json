In the impact, a lawyer sustained injuries, while the gang also hacked another person on the premises. Both were admitted to Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital.\n\nThe police said that Chelladurai and John, both history-sheeter of Kitchipalayam area, were on conditional bail in the murder case of Napoleon, another history-sheeter who was hacked to death in 2015.\n\nThe duo was earlier granted bail on condition that they have to sign in Judicial Magistrate Court II at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. everyday. On Monday, the gang that came in autorickshaws and two-wheelers, waited for the two to come out of the court.\n\nAs both Chelladurai and John moved out in their two-wheelers at 5.30 p.m., the gang hurled the bomb on them. But, the bomb missed them and hit against the wall.\n\nIn the impact, lawyer Murugan who was standing there sustained minor injuries. The gang hacked Alaguvel, who came for a case, and chased Chelladurai and John inside the court premises that was witnessed by the public. The police and lawyers later chased the gang who fled in their vehicles.\n\nSenior police officials said that Napoleon was murdered by a gang last year.
