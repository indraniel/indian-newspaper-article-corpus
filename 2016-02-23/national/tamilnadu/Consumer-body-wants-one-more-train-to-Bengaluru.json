    "text": "The Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, has urged the Union Railways Minister to sanction a new line between Bikshandarkovil and Namakkal so as to provide another route on Bengaluru-Tiruchi sector.\n\nThe new 79-km line could fetch good revenue as there was heavy demand for a new train between Bengaluru and Tiruchi.\n\nAt present, there is only one train daily that connects Tiruchi and Bengaluru \u2014 Mayiladudurai-Mysore Express \u2013 pointed out.\n\nThe travel time to Bangalore from Tiruchi would be reduced by about two-and-a-half hours if the new line was laid, said S. Pushpavanam, secretary of the council, in a representation to the Union Railway Minister.\n\nHe suggested the line could be operated on a build, operate, and transfer mode by the private sector.",
