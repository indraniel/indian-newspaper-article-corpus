Their demands include releasing of promotion list, filling of vacancies, dropping disciplinary action against employees and also fulfilling other demands. They said that the government is not going to incur additional expense by fulfilling their demands. \u201cOur indefinite strike and fasting did not yield any results so far as the government failed to address our concern\u201d, they added.\n\nHence, employees would stage demonstration on Tuesday also, while all employees would stage protest outside the office of the Commissioner of Commercial Tax on February 24, they added.",
