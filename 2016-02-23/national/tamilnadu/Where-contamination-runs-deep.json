Elango, professor, Department of Geology, Anna University, said that as the river\u2019s flow was much above the top of the wells, sewage content and leachate from garbage that was usually confined to the river boundaries mixed with groundwater. Some locations in Besant Nagar had better groundwater quality compared to other areas closer to the banks. The floods had improved parameters like total dissolved solids in groundwater.\n\nUsha Antony of Centre for Biotechnology said that they had to analyse the samples for over a month to find out if the bacterial content thrived in sewage. The bacterial content was expected to come down only if a fresh bout of heavy showers hit Chennai.\n\nExperts advise residents to chlorinate or boil the water before consumption.",
