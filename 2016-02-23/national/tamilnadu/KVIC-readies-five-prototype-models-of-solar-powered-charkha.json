Siddharthan, Development Officer, KVIC, told The Hindu . According to him, the MSME Ministry has given the in-principle permission for introducing the solar-powered charkha.\n\nThe three agencies involved in the research would be the suppliers of the gadget, once the guidelines for charkha scheme was finalised, and the artisans/entrepreneurs could buy the same by getting loans available under Prime Minister\u2019s Employment Generation Programme, he said.",
