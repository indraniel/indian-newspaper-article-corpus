    "text": "While eminent academics have called for disbanding the Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) Vice-Chancellor\u2019s search panel after one of its members, Mu Ramasamy, quit citing serious allegations of impropriety in the selection process, the search panel\u2019s convener, Murukadas, has argued for continuation of the panel with a mere replacement for Mr. Ramasamy.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr. Murukadas, said the MKU senate could elect (unanimously or by election) a new member to represent it on the panel in place of Mr. Ramasamy.\n\nAccording to him, Mr. Ramasamy had resigned citing \u2018mental depression and ill-health.\u2019 \u201cRight from the beginning, he has been telling that he was thinking of resigning due to the pressure exerted by his mentors to take a particular, but impractical line in preparing the V-C panel,\u201d Mr. Murukadas said.\n\nHe claimed that opinions expressed by eminent academics M. Anandakrishnan and S.P. Thyagarajan (both former Vice-Chancellors of Anna University and University of Madras respectively) that the search committee has to be dissolved and a new panel be constituted \u201care borne out of ignorance and malice.\u201d\n\nMr. Murukadas said that when the Syndicate nominee S. Navaneethakrishnan resigned from the MKU Vice-Chancellor search committee on September 12, 2011, the Syndicate met on February 15, 2012, and unanimously nominated K. Kanniyappan in his place and the same was approved by the Higher Education Department.",
