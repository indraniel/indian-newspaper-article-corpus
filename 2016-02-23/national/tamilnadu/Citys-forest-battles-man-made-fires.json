Garbage is often piled up on its edges and late-night gatherings in the forest are common. Officials suspect that with encroachments at its boundaries, many of the fires could be intentional.\n\nMs. Bajpai said three watchers have been deputed at the forest to keep an eye on the fire. Officials had been trying to contain the spread of the blaze. Villagers and residents of the towering apartment complexes nearby have been roped in to report any fire to the department.\n\nSharath R. Babu, Honorary Wildlife Warden, said it is difficult to curb down on fires considering the unregulated entry of people into the area. \u201cParts of the forests have become sites for illegal dumping while a large number of visitors and construction workers use the spot as a recreation area,\u201d he said.",
