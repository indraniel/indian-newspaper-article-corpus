    "text": "Members of the Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners\u2019 Federation staged a demonstration in front of the office of the Regional Transport Officer at Pirattiyur here on Monday in support of their demands.\n\nThey protested against the mandatory requirement of installing speed governors and anti-lock braking system (ABS) in their vehicles.\n\nThey raised slogans protesting against the norms on assembling ABS in the trucks and said it would involve a huge additional financial expenditure for the lorry owners. They wanted that the State government should either meet the expenditure of sanction subsidy for assembling the ABS in the new vehicles. Old vehicles should be exempted from the ambit of this rule. The ABS could not be assembled in the old vehicles, including those available with various government departments.\n\nThe office-bearers said road safety would not be affected in any manner without the system.",
