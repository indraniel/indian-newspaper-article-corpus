    "text": "Residents of Periyathottam area under ward 43 have been reportedly getting highly contaminated water in their houses following ruptures in the drinking water supply line.\n\n\u201cDue to the breaks in the pipeline, sewage and other dirt are getting mixed with the water. Since most of the population in the locality belong to lower middle class of society, we cannot afford to buy water supplied by private parties in tanker lorries. We have been filtering and boiling the water before consuming to minimise the ill-effects,\u201d pointed out Abu Tahir, a resident of the area.\n\nOn Monday, the residents came to meet the District Collector and other senior revenue officials with the samples of contaminated water that was pale yellowish in colour and contained worms.\n\nAccording to the residents, they have been forced to approach the Collector and other officials as the issue was not solved despite taken to the notice of the Corporation administration. When contacted, councillor S. Priya said that she too had asked the Corporation officials on many occasions to rectify the problems in the supply lines, but did not get adequate response. Following the intervention of the district administration, the repair works began on Monday evening.",
