    "text": "In a move to help resettled residents travel to their workplaces without any difficulty, the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) has submitted a proposal to the State government to issue free bus passes to them.\n\n\u201cMany residents had approached us asking for bus passes, so we prepared this plan,\u201d said a senior official from TNSCB.\n\nOver 4,000 flood affected people have been resettled in the last three months in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and Perumbakkam.\n\nBut ever since the allotment, residents have been complaining about the loss of their livelihood.\n\n\u201cTravelling to the city has become very difficult for us. We have lost our jobs and we are trying to manage with whatever we have,\u201d said S. Kavitha, of Ezhil Nagar in Perumbakkam.\n\n\u201cIf our transport arrangement is sorted out, it will be a great relief and rest of the things will be fine,\u201d she added. The free bus pass, if issued, will be valid for one whole year.\n\nThe MTC had introduced buses on 10 new routes that connect TNSCB tenements at Thoraipakkam and Perumbakkam with Saidapet, Guindy, Tambaram and rest of the city, officials said.",
