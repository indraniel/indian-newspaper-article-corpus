Presently, Sanskrit is taught in many CBSE/ICSE schools only up to class VIII.\n\nCriticising the recommendation DMK president M Karunanidhi had recently sought the intervention of the Prime Minister on the issue. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss accused the NDA Government of trying to impose the language in schools and TMC leader G K Vasan too issued a statement on Monday demanding that the recommendation must be shelved.\n\nLanguage in TN schools\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, schools affiliated to various boards already have Tamil as a compulsory subject under the Tamil Nadu Tamil Learning Act of 2006 and the CBSE schools were also brought under this purview in 2014.\n\nThe CBSE schools have the concept of a third language from classes V to VIII, where students can learn the basics of any of the language the school offers.\n\nMany schools offer Sanskrit as one of the options for second or third language for the students, among Hindi, Tamil and French.",
