Jyothimani and expert member R. Nagendran said.\n\nThe Bench rejected a memo filed by the Ministry and further permitted the counsels appearing for appellants and other respondents to peruse the records pertaining to M/s. Sindya Power Generating Company Pvt. Ltd in the chambers of the NGT Registrar between February 24 and 26.\n\nThe Bench was dealing with a batch of appeals, which challenged clearances given by the Ministry granting M/s. Sindya Power Generating Company Private Limited to set up the plant in Perunthottam and Agara Perunthottam.\n\nIt may be noted that during the course of the hearing, though the entire set of original files were submitted along with one set of photocopies by the Additional Solicitor General, some pages were missing in the photocopies, when the law clerks compared them with the original files . The bench\u2019s order has listed out the details of pages that were missing.\n\nThe tribunal had directed the Ministry to produce all documents relating to the case. Though they were submitted, the counsel appearing for the Ministry had objected to counsels of appellants and respondents perusing those documents contending they contained \u201csensitive documents and official communications.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not see any reason to accept the contention raised by the 1st respondent [Ministry] that disclosing information may affect sovereignty and integrity of India or security, strategy or scientific or economic interest of the State or lead to incitement of an offence or affecting relationship with foreign State. It is certainly not any personal information which is exempted,\u201d the bench added.",
