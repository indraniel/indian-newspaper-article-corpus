    "text": "A group of teachers with disabilities staged a protest on Saturday. This was the third day of their protest, said R. Sudhakar, president of the TN Differently Abled Specially Trained Teachers\u2019 Welfare Association. \u201cAll we are asking for is employment for us,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sudhakar said the teachers had been trained at a government teachers\u2019 training institute in Poonamallee.\n\n\u201cWhile those trained between 2004 and 2008 got jobs in 2010, those trained from 2008 onwards to 2013 are still waiting. There are 75 of us who are waiting. The institute was shut down eventually as no one was joining due to lack of jobs,\u201d he claimed.",
