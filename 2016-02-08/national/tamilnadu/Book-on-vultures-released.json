Krishnakumar, and the first copy was received by Chief Wildlife Warden V.K. Melkani. Director of Tamil Nadu Forest Academy Rajeev Srivastava, Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Division, I. Anwardeen and others were present during the book release.\n\nChief editor of the book S. Chandrasekaran said that vultures are naturally allotted the most commendable job of scavenging and thereby ridding other animals of disease. \u201cBut sadly that their population is in the peril of extinction due to modern practices such as indiscriminate use of extensive use of Diclofenac,\u201d he said.\n\nThe book that runs to about 100 pages analyses the factors affecting the raptors, breeding cycle, habitat potential and remedies to conserve the big birds. The book also deals with a rapid raptor study that was conducted by the Forest Department, a year ago. It also elaborates on the role of NGOs and veterinarians in popularising alternative drugs to Diclofenac.",
