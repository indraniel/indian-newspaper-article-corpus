The incident led to registering a case against three persons attached to the diocese and their arrest.\n\nLater that day, two priests from the diocese and two others, who accompanied them to the Kuniyamuthur police to inquire about the arrest of the persons running the home, were attacked by members of a few Hindu outfits and their vehicle was also damaged.\n\nThe protestors claimed that a case was registered against seven attackers and two of them were arrested.\n\nBut, they were also released on bail. They also denied allegations that the inmates of ASSISI Snehalaya were ill treated.\n\nOn Sunday, the protest procession was led by Bishop of Diocese of Ramanathapuram, Paul Alappatt and it concluded at Holy Trinity Church with a meeting.\n\nThey also signed a petition seeking arrest of the assaulters and to protect minorities from such attacks.\n\nThe organisers said that the representation would be handed over to the District Collector on Monday for forwarding it to the Chief Minister and Prime Minister\u2019s offices.",
