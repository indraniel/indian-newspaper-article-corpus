    "text": "Since district and sub-jails house only remand prisoners, there is little that the authorities are able to do about involving inmates in income-generation activities in Erode district.\n\nIn Erode, the district jail is at Gobichettipalayam and the sub-jail functions on the premises of Erode Taluk Office. While there are presently 43 inmates in the sub-jail \u2013 up to the maximum accommodation capacity, the number is even lesser at 37 in the district jail that has a capacity to house a maximum of 200 prisoners.\n\nRemand prisoners housed in the district jails and sub-jails are usually those who would have committed petty crimes that are bailable offences. Hence, the number of inmates keeps fluctuating. For instance, there were nearly 60 inmates in the Gobi district a few months back.\n\nEven if any training or income-generation programme is planned, the continuity of utility for all inmates is not a certainty, official sources said.\n\nAs in other jails, the services of some inmates are regularly sought for cooking and other kitchen work. But, involving them in other activities is not possible without increase in manpower and infrastructure resources, the sources said.\n\nNevertheless, to begin with, yoga classes are likely in the near future for inmates of Gobi district jail, the sources said.",
