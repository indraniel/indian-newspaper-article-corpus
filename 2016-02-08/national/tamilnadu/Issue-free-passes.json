    "text": "Several senior citizens\u2019 associations have asked the AIADMK government to fulfil one of the promises it had made in the run-up to the last Assembly elections.\n\nThe AIADMK had promised to provide free bus passes for those aged above 58 years in its manifesto. Several forums for the elderly have said that the promise has remained unfulfilled.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Elders\u2019 Welfare Association had earlier passed a resolution in its meeting demanding that the government issue orders ensuring free travel for senior citizens on MTC buses.\n\nS.M. Chellaswamy, association\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe free bus pass scheme for senior citizens may not affect the revenue of the government. Many pensioners spend at least 10 per cent on travel every month. The government now provides 10 per cent concession on fares on buses operated by the TNSTC.\u201d\n\nAt least 10% of pension is spent on travel, says The Tamil Nadu Elders Welfare Association",
