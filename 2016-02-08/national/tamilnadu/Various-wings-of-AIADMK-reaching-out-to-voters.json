    "text": "As the countdown to the elections begins and parties are hitting the road, the various wings of the AIADMK too reaching out to the voters. The party\u2019s IT wing that has two alumni of the Indian Institute of Management among its office-bearers is looking at a fresh approach to canvassing.\n\nAfter a State-wide tour by office-bearers, the wing has chosen 2,000 youngsters from all the party districts units and formed an IT task wing for every Assembly constituency. These are graduates, who are computer and internet savvy and have smart phones.\n\n\u201cWe have had one-on-one meetings with these volunteers and after assessing their skill-sets have given them a road map for the next 110- 120 days. We have mapped out what they have to do on an hourly basis and not just daily basis. They will do demographic and psychographic mapping of the voters along with regular online propaganda,\u201d explained \u2018Aspire\u2019 K. Swaminathan, secretary of the IT wing.\n\nOther wings too are trying to outdo each other in taking AIADMK general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa\u2019s achievements to the voters. The Amma Peravai for instance has decided to distribute copies of her reply to the Governor\u2019s address in the Assembly in January, 2016 to 5.5 crore voters.\n\n\u201cWe are taking out rallies in all the 50 party districts and distributing the 30-page booklets. It was an emotional speech that outlines everything that Amma has done for the people,\u201d said Amma Peravai secretary and Revenue Minister R.B. Udayakumar.\n\nWooing women\n\nMembers of the Women\u2019s wing are ensuring that they reach the women in homes. \u201cWe have the privilege to enter homes and talk to the homemakers. Every house has something of Amma \u2019s schemes\u2026 we remind them about how she takes care of the people. Women voters also take this opportunity to ask for any kind of help they need. Some ask for health care in hospitals or government certificates, we ensure that it is done,\u201d said the women\u2019s wing secretary and Handloom Minister S. Gokula Indira.\n\nThe Unorganised Drivers\u2019 wing has been creating awareness of the need to wear helmets while riding two-wheelers using a van that has audio visual aid. It uses cultural programmes to canvas for road safety and to take information about Ms. Jayalalithaa\u2019s schemes to the masses.",
