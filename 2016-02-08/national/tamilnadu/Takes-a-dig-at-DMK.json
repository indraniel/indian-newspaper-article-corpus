    "text": "The DMK will not come to power even it clinches an alliance with the Congress and also with the DMDK because voters in Tamil Nadu still remember the \u201catrocities\u201d done to people by M. Karunanidhi and his party men during the previous regime, said Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam.\n\nAddressing the party workers meeting held here on Sunday, he said that Mr. Karunanidhi was dreaming to come to power in this assembly election.\n\nPeople had already decided to elect AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa to power again, he said, adding that they had been waiting for poll announcement date to show their support.\n\nHitting hard on Stalin and his Namakku Naame programme, Mr. Panneerselvam described it as a political gimmick.\n\nPeople would not believe his gimmick, he added.",
