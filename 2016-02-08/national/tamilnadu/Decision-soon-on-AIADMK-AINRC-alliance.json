    "text": "Chief Minister N. Rangasamy has said that the decision on an alliance between the AIADMK and the AINRC will be taken once the Assembly election schedule is announced.\n\nAhead of the Rajya Sabha polls in September, Mr. Rangasamy was faced with a revolt by five AINRC MLAs which culminated in a new political equation with the AIADMK. The AINRC managed a deal under which its nominee N. Gokula Krishnan was fielded as the AIADMK\u2019s candidate for the sole RS seat. Though the deal was seen as a sign of revival of ties between AINRC and the AIADMK, neither the AIADMK nor the AINRC called it an alliance.\n\nMr. Rangasamy was also non-committal on whether he would be ready to work with the BJP to face elections.",
