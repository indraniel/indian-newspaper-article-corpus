    "text": "The United Farmers\u2019 Association \u2013 Tamil Nadu has urged the State Government to come forward to provide subsidy-linked loan to the marginal farmers for the purchase of bullocks for farm activities.\n\nMechanisation of farm activities has led to the drastic reduction in the population of farm animals in the country. More than 65 per cent of the farming community in the State are marginal farmers and they cannot afford mechanised farming activities using costly equipment, C. Vaiyapuri, president of the United Farmers\u2019 Association \u2013 Tamil Nadu, said in a statement issued here on Tuesday.\n\nThese marginal farmers have to depend on the farm animals for ploughing etc. The government should come forward to provide subsidy-linked loans to the marginal farmers for purchasing farm animals on the lines of the financial assistance extended for the purchase of tractors, he said.\n\nMr. Vaiyapuri complained that the major roads and streets in the villages have become narrow due to encroachments by anti-social elements. In some of the panchayats, the car festivals of the local temples could not be held due to the narrow roads. The authorities should take steps to retrieve the encroached land and widen the roads.",
