    "text": "For not taking action against those named in suicide note\n\nA fact-finding team has demanded the suspension of police personnel in Villupuram for not taking prompt action against all those named in a suicide note of a 29-year-old differently abled Dalit conservancy worker.\n\nAyyaru, a conservancy worker in Asanur village panchayat in Ulundurpet sub-division, was allegedly harassed by panchayat president Shanthi\u2019s husband Selvaraj. According to a member of the team sent by Madurai-based non-governmental organisation \u2018Evidence,\u2019 taking advantage of Ayyaru\u2019s ignorance, Selvaraj had not only abused him to clean toilets in his house, but also withheld his paltry salary of Rs. 2,040 per month.\n\nWhen Ayyaru complained about this to his brother Harikrishnan, the latter questioned Selvaraj about it. Angered over this, Selvaraj had intimidated Ayyaru quite often. In a note, Ayyaru had held Selvaraj responsible for driving him to commit suicide.\n\nWhile Selvaraj was arrested, the police have not acted against others named in the suicide note.\n\n\u201cEdaikal police personnel who had shown scant respect for Ayyaru\u2019s complaint initially should be suspended. Panchayat president Shanthi should also be arrested. The State government should immediately release Rs. 10 lakh to the family members of Ayyaru,\u201d the team said.",
