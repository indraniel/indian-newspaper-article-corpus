    "text": "Forest fire forces animals to migrate, say tribals at the village\n\nAn Indian Gaur, weighing around a tonne, slipped into deep gorge and died on the spot near Adukkam village on lower Kodaikanal hill on Sunday.\n\nActing on information by local people, forest officials rushed to the spot and found the carcass of the Gaur in a gorge in reserve forests. Neck and horns of the Gaur were broken.\n\nAfter inspecting the carcass, the officials ruled out the possibility of poaching. They suspect that the gaur fell from a 100-foot-high cliff. After post-mortem, the carcass would be buried in the reserve forests, they said.\n\nTribal people at the village say fire in the reserve forests areas often forced wild animals to migrate. Forest fire in the area was spreading rapidly owing to strong winds for the past four days. The wild animal might have run blindly for safety and must have slipped into the gorge, the officials said.",
