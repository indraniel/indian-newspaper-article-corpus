    "text": "Both ghat roads connecting Kodaikanal with Palani and Dindigul were closed for hours following two non-fatal accidents reported near Vazhaigiri and Saverikadu on Sunday.\n\nIn the first accident, two persons were grievously injured when a truck proceeding to Kodaikanal from Batlagundu collided head-on with a car going from Kodaikanal to Chennai at Vadakaraiparai village on Kodaikanal-Ghat Road.\n\nThe injured were car driver Chinthan (26) and one B. Sathish (22), both from Chennai. The injured were rushed to Thandigudi Government Hospital for treatment. The front portion of the car was damaged.\n\nVehicle movement was paralysed on this road for three hours as it was very narrow at the accident spot. The police struggled to reach the spot as vehicles were stranded in both directions.\n\nWith the help of local people, the police pushed the damaged vehicles to the roadside to allow vehicle movement.\n\nIn the second accident, an LPG cylinder-laden lorry collided head-on with a van coming in the opposite direction on Palani-Kodaikanal Ghat Road near Saverikadu. Drivers of both the vehicles sustained minor injuries. Traffic was closed on the road for an hour following the accident.\n\nBoth the drivers got engaged in a heated argument and refused to move their vehicles. Kodaikanal police had to travel 45 km to reach the spot. The same spot witnessed two landslips during the recent rain.\n\nLater, the police asked the drivers to move their vehicles to the roadside to enable vehicle movement.",
