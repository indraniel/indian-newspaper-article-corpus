Bookings were open two weeks before the film\u2019s release. For the movie, \u2018Aranmanai\u2019, the booking window opened a week before the film hit the screens.\n\nThe Revenant\n\nCurrently, pre-booking is open for Leonardo Dicaprio-starrer, \u2018The Revenant\u2019, and filmmaker Vetrimaran\u2019s \u2018Visaranai\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe concept helps the movie-maker understand the buzz for the film in the market. You need not wait till the eleventh hour,\u201d said a programmer from a well-known multiplex in the city.\n\nUncertain areas\n\nBut it is not without uncertainties.\n\n\u201cIf the film is postponed or fails to clear the censors and does not hit the screens on time, the theatre owner has to return the cash. That way, it is tricky,\u201d he said.\n\nRaju Mahalingam, creative head, Lyca Productions, said that pre-booking may not directly help producers since theatres do not pass on the money to the producer, but it could still matter in a larger scheme of things.\n\nNegotiating rights\n\n\u201cA great demand could be used as leverage while negotiating television rights, DVD rights, overseas rights and with distributors. Going forward, better terms could be negotiated with theatre owners so that a part of this money could also be used to subsidise print and publicity costs,\u201d he said.\n\nBut will it work in an industry where producers do not have a coherent and a well-coordinated release strategy and does it have a flip side?\n\n\u201cThe release dates need to be sorted out first to actually plan pre-booking. Also, this might work for movies which have a tremendous demand \u2013 like the ones by Rajini, Ajith or Vijay. Smaller movies might not get much out of the pre-booking concept,\u201d said Sashikanth, a producer.",
