    "text": "Multiple Sclerosis should be recognised as multiple disability under the proposed Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, speakers said on Sunday.\n\nAt a meeting organised by Multiple Sclerosis Society of India, its Chennai chapter chairperson Ann Gonsalvez said they were planning to give a strong statement to the Union Government and Group of Ministers about this. The Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, London, along with other organisations around the world are working hard and joining together to find a cure and ultimately to put an end to MS. The campaign is called Kiss Goodbye to MS, a way for everyone to do something and contribute support that MS people urgently need.\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the Central Nervous System, affecting its functioning unexpectedly and repeatedly, resulting in devastating disabilities in young people in the prime of their lives. Multiple Sclerosis has various symptoms ranging from minor visual disturbance to total paralysis. \u2013special correspondent",
