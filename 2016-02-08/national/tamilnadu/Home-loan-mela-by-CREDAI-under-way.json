Nagar, will be followed by Fairpro 2016, which is scheduled to be held from February 19 to 21 at the Chennai Trade Centre.\n\nNine banks, including SBI, LICHF, ICICI, AXIS, Sundaram Paribas, KVB, HDFC, TATA Capital and Aditya Birla HSG Finance, are participating with innovative offers to attract buyers.\n\n\u201cAfter every disaster, home loan offtake usually drops, only to rise in a few months. As the State government and civic bodies such as Chennai Corporation are implementing flood-mitigation projects, residents are expected to take a decision now,\u201d said T.A.
