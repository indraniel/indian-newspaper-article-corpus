    "text": "In a relief to four doctors, who completed their postgraduate degree from the ESIC Medical College Hospital here, the Madras High Court has directed the Tamil Nadu Medical Council to register their degrees issued by the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University.\n\nThe doctors had moved the court as they were not permitted to register their PG degrees with the Tamil Nadu Medical Council on the ground that the ESIC Medical College Hospital was not included in the Schedule of the Act by the Medical Council of India.\n\nCounsel for the petitioners contented that at the time of admission, the course was duly recognised and the Medical Council of India had also granted a letter of permission enabling it to commence and conduct PG programmes and admissions to PG courses.\n\nThough they had obtained provisional certificates, they were not permitted to register their PG degrees with the council since the Medical Council of India had not given its recognition to the college then. Hence, the plea.\n\nNoting that the issue involved in this writ petition was no more res integra (an entirely new or untouched matter), Justice M.M. Sundresh cited an order on a similar case delivered on January 4. In that case, the MCI\u2019s contention that the ratio laid down in the said judgment for undergraduate courses cannot be applied for post-graduation courses was not accepted by the judge.\n\nPetitioners V. Manoj, P.N. Chandrika, N. Poornima and S. Lakshmanan had sought a direction to the Tamil Nadu Medical Council to register their PG degrees issued by Dr. MGR Medical University.",
