Selvaraj, joint secretary Mounasami and district secretariat member Ashraf Ali resigned on February 6 , after the February 4 District Council meeting.\n\nIn the 50-plus-member District Council, the three found themselves in a minority on the issue of bifurcating the district unit into urban and rural units for easy administration. The three had opposed the move while the majority was in favour of such a division.\n\nMany political parties in the district have two units and a few have even four units \u2013 north urban, north rural, south urban and south rural units.\n\nThe sources said that as the three found that they were in a minority, they tendered the resignation to the Council, which had accepted the same and nominated V.S. Sundaram, as the interim secretary. And, there is nothing more to their resignation.\n\nMr. Selvaraj said that he wanted to resign as he had to look after the trade union activities. He was a president of the federation of transport workers and district general secretary of the engineering workers\u2019 association. His resignation would in no way affect the election work, he added.\n\nThe party sources said that they would await the guidance of the Sate leadership to convene the next District Council to decide the next set of office bearers. The three who had resigned were also part of the seven-member District Secretariat.",
