For Adil Writer from Mumbai, the decision to stay in Puducherry happened naturally as he moved here to learn pottery from Golden Bridge Pottery. \u201cI did not think much while deciding to stay back here,\u201d he said.\n\nA place that entices many talents from across the world has seen drastic changes over the years. Young film-maker Nishanth Varma and photographer Pattabi Raman have documented the events, festivities, art and landscapes of Puducherry.\n\n\u201cThe landscapes in Puducherry and its character change swiftly. Heritage is like time. My relevance to a place or aspect of life is relevant to the time,\u201d he said.\n\nFashion designer Sonam Dubal, currently doing research in textile, heritage, and embroidery along the Silk Route and its cultural linkages with contemporary clothing, shared his love for Puducherry.\n\nAs dusk fell on Sunday, children were seen playing with tops and \u2018Seven Stones.\u2019 They painted, danced, played traditional games at Gandhi Tindal.

In order to draw the attention of visitors to conserving trees, a tree made of plastic bottles and waste was on display at the exhibition.\n\nCelebrating the closing ceremony of the Pondicherry Heritage Festival 2016 which began on February 5, musical performance by Adishakti Group and a celebration of natural heritage through dance was performed by young girls from Anegundi Village, Hampi and Lycee, Puducherry.\n\nAs the conversations on the heritage festival came to an end, some participants expressed concern over the relatively low public patronage and participation by government, and hoped that community engagement would be stronger in subsequent editions of the festival.\n\nThe three-day festival organised by INTACH, The People for Pondicherry\u2019s Heritage PondyCAN, Department of Art, Cutlure and Tourism, and supported by Alliance Francaise and French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP) concluded on Sunday.",
