    "text": "When Justice P. Devadass of the Madras High Court visited Thiruvadanai to open District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate Court building on Sunday, he could not resist overcoming with nostalgia.\n\nThe judge recalled the good old days when he served as Judicial Magistrate in the court about 30 years ago.\n\nThis was one of the oldest courts established during the British regime and it functioned in a revenue department building, he said. Unlike now, there was no pile-up of cases those days and it was a pleasure working then, he said. The judgements he delivered could be seen from the 1988-89 records. He extensively travelled on buses and was familiar with \u2018Kaikaatti\u2019 bus stop, RS Mangalam and Thondi areas, he said. \u201cI still remember the court functioned in an old building,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he learnt that the complex, built at a cost of Rs. 2.17 crore, could not be opened for long for want of infrastructure facilities, he took special interest in opening the court after he became the portfolio judge for the district, he said, and thanked former Collector K. Nanthakumar and district councillor (Thiruvadanai region) K.C. Animuthu for releasing funds to create necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe judge appealed to the new Collector, S. Natarajan, to add greenery to the complex.",
