    "text": "A Government Order making it mandatory for the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) to obtain prior approval from the government for initiating prosecution proceedings against government officials has drawn flak.\n\nThe GO issued on February 2 makes it mandatory for DVAC to refer all corruption related complaints against any government staff to the respective Department, through the Vigilance Department, for appropriate order. Based on the remarks, the Vigilance Commission would take a decision and communicate it to DVAC.\n\nEarlier, to shield the top officials from the inquiry by DVAC, the government had issued an order to get prior approval from it.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered that the \u201cstatus or position of a public servant\u201d does not qualify for any exemption and all corrupt officials should be treated equally.\n\nUnfortunately, the government, instead of bringing All India Service officials also equal to other government servants, had made all other government servants above All India Service officials, says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC) K. Kathirmathiyon.\n\nAccording to him, the order only shields senior officials by extending it to all categories of the government servants of the State.\n\nIt is totally unacceptable and unhealthy, and also harmful to the interest of the public and hence CCC strongly opposed the GO.\n\nAlready only very few people are approaching DVAC due to some unacceptable procedures/long drawn process. If the present order is implemented, CCC doubts whether any one would even come forward to complain, he adds.",
