    "text": "Residents of Nochipalayam under Karaipudur village panchayat are in a dilemma over whom they should next represent their grievances pertaining to bad roads, lack of public toilets and improper drainage network, among other issues.\n\n\u201cWe have already taken up the problems to the notice of officials and elected representatives. However, the authorities have shown little interest in addressing the grievances,\u201d said P. Balasubramanian, a resident of the area.\n\nBlack top on the road stretches passing through the hamlet has come out in most places.\n\nAccording to the residents, many of the houses still do not have toilets attached to them.\n\n\u201cSince public toilets are not constructed, many of the migrant labourers staying here have to opt for open defecation,\u201d they pointed out.\n\nWhen contacted, Karaipudur village panchayat president A. Nataraj said that the panchayat administration had sent a proposal to the State Government to re-lay the black top surface on the main road connecting Nochipalayam with Meenambarai, the next main hamlet.\n\nOn setting up of public toilet complex, he said that the civic body had already passed a resolution to construct the facility, but would have to wait for the commencement of the next financial year (2015-16) to seek funds for the execution of the project.",
