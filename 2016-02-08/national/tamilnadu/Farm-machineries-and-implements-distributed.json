Poonachi, Minister for Khadi and Village Industries, here on Saturday.\n\nMr. Poonachi said the State government accorded priority for increasing farm productivity and the supply of machines at subsidised cost to farmers would help them overcome the problems caused by shortage of farm hands.\n\nHe distributed power tillers and other implements under the National Agriculture Development Programme and other schemes.\n\nMr. Poonachi distributed assistive devices to 100 differently abled children who were identified through medical camps conducted under the Education for All Scheme. About 208 differently abled children have been identified, through medical camps held in all 16 unions, for supply of assistive devices estimated at Rs. 8.01 lakh in the district, he said.\n\nR.
