    "text": "Political parties and farmers\u2019 associations have decided to stage demonstrations in the seven district headquarters in the Western region on February 23 to protest against the move by Gas Authority of India Limited to lay natural gas pipelines across agricultural fields.\n\nAt a meeting of Farmers\u2019 Protection Committee chaired by A. Ganeshamurthy, former Erode MP and district secretary of the MDMK, the representatives of various political parties and farmers\u2019 associations questioned the rationale behind digging up agricultural fields in Tamil Nadu, while opting to lay pipelines along highways in Kerala and Karnataka. The Centre\u2019s support to GAIL against the backdrop of a resolution adopted in the Assembly against the company\u2019s move to align its pipeline inside fields was tantamount to disturbing the spirit of federalism, they said.",
