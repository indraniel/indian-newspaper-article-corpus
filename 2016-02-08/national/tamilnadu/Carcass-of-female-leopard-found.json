Periasamy, during regular patrols on Sunday.\n\nAutopsy of the animal was conducted by N. S. Manoharan, the Wildlife Veterinary Officer.\n\nMr. Periasamy and Dr. Manoharan told The Hindu that the leopard, aged around five years, looked to have been killed in a fight with another \u2018stronger predator\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe brain has suffered damage,\u201d said Mr. Periasamy. According to him the teeth of the \u2018stronger predator\u2019 must have punctured the skull of the leopard. During the post-mortem, its stomach was filled with undigested bone, quills and hair of porcupine, indicating that it had eaten its prey before the fatal encounter. Dr. Manoharan said the body samples of the leopard would be sent to laboratories.",
