They are expected to come down to Tamil Nadu this week to directly talk to Mr. Vijayakant about the alliance,\u201d said a senior leader. The Ministers were identified by BJP national president Amit Shah to oversee poll preparations in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe leader said the high command wanted to wind up alliance talks by February 20 and move to the first phase of electioneering before March. Most Union Ministers are expected to campaign in the State in next month with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to make multiple visits.\n\nLast week, at a consultation meeting in Kochi, Mr. Shah gave the go-ahead for tours by six senior leaders of the BJP Tamil Nadu unit. They are expected to focus on specific regions and tour individually to cover as much ground as possible.\n\n\u201cThe delay in finalising alliances has put the release of the manifesto on hold. But any more delay might hurt the party. Whatever the outcome, we would have to hit the ground by March 1,\u201d the leader added.\n\nBJP is keen\n\non concluding\n\nalliance\n\ntalks by\n\nFebruary 20",
