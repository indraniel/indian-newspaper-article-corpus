The app helps reduce damage caused by sepsis: it will support doctors to quickly assess and identify patients with a \u2018sepsis screening tool. In addition to clinical pathways, the app will also provide an aid to promote good communication and handover between healthcare professionals. The app, developed with technical support from Med India, will be free to download on iOS and Android platforms.",
