Later, revenue and police officials held a discussion with the agitators, who alleged that TANGEDCO officials neither came to the hospital nor met them so far. His wife Mallika insisted that the government should provide job to one of her family members for survival.\n\nSubramani (40) of Y.M.R. Patti, slipped from a post while working on Karur Road at Nehruji Nagar. The body was removed to Dindigul GH for post-mortem.
