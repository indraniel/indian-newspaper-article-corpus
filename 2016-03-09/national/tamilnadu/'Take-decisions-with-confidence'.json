Mohanasundari, Managing Director of Sharp Industries, conveyed to a student gathering, at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathyamangalam, on the occasion of International Women's Day.\n\n\"Think differently. Make the most of the digital era, to determine market for products, and focus constantly on quality,\" she said, explaining that when industry organisations are ready to provide hand-holding support and banks are prepared to fund viable projects, there was no reason why students must not think about pursuing entrepreneurship in right earnest.\n\nRecounting her entrepreneurial journey, Ms. Mohanasundari said taking decisions with confidence and clarity of mind was all about succeeding in life. As chief guest, she conferred Women of Excellence Award to Kalpana Shankar, chairperson and Managing Trustee, Hand-in-Hand India, Chennai; and Sitara Vikram, co-founder and Executive Director, CS Academy, Erode.
