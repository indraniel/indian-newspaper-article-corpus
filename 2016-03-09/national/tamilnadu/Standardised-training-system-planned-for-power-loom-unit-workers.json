Senthil Kumar, chairman of Southern India Mills\u2019 Association, it is estimated that for every 1,000 looms, 600 people are employed. Presently, the sector does not have a training system for the 1.2 lakh workers directly employed in the power loom units in the two districts. The three textile research associations (NITRA, BITRA and SITRA) have developed curriculum for weavers and this would be finalised soon. There are five to six job roles in the weaving sector and a weaver need nearly 300 hours of training (nearly 40 days). The plan is to train the trainers through the council and since the power loom units in the two districts are located in clusters, the trainers can visit the units for developing the skills of the workers. The employees will get a certificate at the end of the training and this will benefit them when they move to other units for work too. The local power loom associations or individual units should take the village-level initiative, he said. They can also become the manpower providing centres for the power loom units.\n\nDepending on the progress of the project, it could be replicated in other power loom clusters in the country too, he added.",
