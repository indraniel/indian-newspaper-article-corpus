Subbu, developed a wordy duel with driver Govindan (40).\n\nSubbu pushed Mr. Govindan down from his seat and started the vehicle in reverse.\n\nAs the lorry suddenly came in reverse and ran over a two-wheeler, the women and the cleaner, who was helping the women, ran helter skelter. Kunjrammal fell down in the commotion and was crushed to death, the police said.\n\nTwo other women were injured and admitted to Government District Headquarters Hospital here.\n\nMr. Govindan was also admitted to the hospital with injuries.\n\nThe police arrested Subbu and produced him in a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody.",
