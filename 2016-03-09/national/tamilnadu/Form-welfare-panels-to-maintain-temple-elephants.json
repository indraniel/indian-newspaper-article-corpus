    "text": "The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to constitute state and district-level welfare committees as envisaged under the Tamil Nadu Captive Elephant (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2011 for the upkeep of temple elephants.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh passed the direction on a Public Interest Litigation appeal moved by Radha Rajan seeking a direction to government to formulate comprehensive rules to take care of animals donated to temples. The petitioner invited the court\u2019s attention to the plight of an ailing elephant named \u2018Madhuravalli\u2019 at the Arulmighu Koodalalagar temple.\n\nHe submitted that medical treatment is not yielding any positive result and a decision has been taken to hand it over to the Forest Department. Noting that the elephant needs urgent attention, the Bench directed the temple authorities to hand it over to the Forest Department within seven days. The petitioner also told the court that \u2018Gomathi\u2019, an elephant housed at Arulmighu Mahalingaswami Thirukovil, Kumbakonam, is also ailing. \u201cThe elephant practically stands abandoned by the Mutt and thus steps should be taken to hand it over to the Forest Department,\u201d he added.",
