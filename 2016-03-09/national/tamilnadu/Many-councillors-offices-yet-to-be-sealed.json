Some offices have been sealed but councillors continue to visit the offices and meet with the public there. A few assistant engineers at the ward level claimed that the councillors had been reluctant to cooperate with them whenever they took initiatives to act as per the model code of conduct.\n\nMost of the councillors continue to visit the offices every day.\n\nOn Tuesday, many of the councillors visited the ward offices, sat in another room and met people. But officials said they were unable to take action because the rooms had already been locked and sealed.\n\nGreater Chennai Corporation Council Secretary has already locked offices of the deputy Mayor, standing committee chairpersons and ward committee chairpersons.",
