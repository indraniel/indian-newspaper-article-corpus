Art Centre\u2019s Annual Women\u2019s Craft Bazaar held here on Tuesday.\n\nThis year, Bargavi Devendra, honorary secretary of C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation, and P. Priyamvatha of News X Channel were presented the \u2018Golden Jubilee Woman Achiever Award\u2019 by foundation.\n\nMs. Devendra said that though women had accomplished great things, recent trends in the way women were being treated were indeed disturbing.\n\n\u201cWhen we open newspapers, we see various atrocities women are subjected to \u2014 this must stop. We must start counselling women at an early age and there must be counsellors in school to help children out in case of any such problems,\u201d she said.\n\nActor and dancer Vyjayanthimala Bali said reformers in the past had done so much for the uplift of women.\n\n\u201cNothing ever comes without hard work. Women who have succeeded have earned every bit of their success with incredible hard work,\u201d she added.\n\nNanditha Krishna of the foundation said the crafts bazaar had, over the years, been \u2018of the women, for the women and by the women\u2019.\n\n\u201cI have seen several of them come with tragic stories and they have since grown and emerged out as successful poeple. They stand as an inspiring,\u201d she added.\n\nRecent trends in the way women were being treated were disturbing, said Bargavi Devendra",
