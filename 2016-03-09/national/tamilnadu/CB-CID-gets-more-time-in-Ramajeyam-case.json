Nehru\u2019s brother K.N. Ramajeyam.\n\nJustice V.S. Ravi gave time till June 1 after accepting the submissions of Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian that the investigation was proceeding in the right direction and the investigating officer was confident of achieving a breakthrough at the earliest.\n\nMr. Ramajeyam, a prominent businessman in Tiruchi, was apparently abducted during his morning walk near his residence in Thillai Nagar and murdered brutally by unidentified assailants on March 29, 2012.\n\nHis wife Latha approached the High Court Bench in December 2014 seeking a CBI probe since the CB-CID failed to arrest the culprits even after two years.\n\nSince then, the High Court had been providing time, once in three months, to the CB-CID.",
