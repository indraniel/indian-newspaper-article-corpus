Nagar RTO and Taluk offices, Vandalur Zoo and Nageshwara Rao park.\n\nThe services have been available since March 2. Officials are planning to open more hotspots across south, east and north Chennai.\n\n\u201cWe have identified 20 locations in south Chennai and plan to cover them in one month,\u201d said an official spokesperson of BSNL.\n\nThe firm had already set up a Wi-Fi hotspot at the shore temple in Mahabalipuram in October, last year.\n\n\u201cWe have received good reviews from customers there. We are also looking at tourist spots and bus stands, but will be setting up more depending on the number of users in the zone, user\u2019s position, type of surroundings where they can get download speed up to 8 mbps,\u201d the official added.\n\nCustomers will be able to use the Wi-Fi service free of charge for the first 15 minutes, and to continue services, they will have to purchase e-coupons through the access device for different durations, volumes and validity periods. The coupons can be used at any BSNL Wi-Fi zone in south and west India. The hotspots are being set up in partnership with M/s. Quadgen Wireless.\n\nFor details call Ph: 1800 425 5300 or visit http://qfi.rocks",
