    "text": "Fishermen have planned to stage a protest in New Delhi on Thursday to urge the Centre to fulfil their long-pending demands which include setting up of a separate Ministry and their inclusion in the Schedule Tribes list.\n\n\u201cBefore the BJP was elected to power at the Centre, they organised three fishers\u2019 conferences and released a 64-page policy document containing several of our demands. However, even after two-and-a-half years since they assumed office they have not met our demands. In this year\u2019s budget, the terms fishermen or fisheries did not even find a mention. We have been ignored, which is why we are planning a protest on Thursday in Delhi,\u201d said M. Ilango, National Fishworkers Forum.\n\nRepresentatives of Tamil Nadu Meenavar Munnetra Sangam, South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association and Akila Indiya Meenavar Valarchi Kazhagam will be taking part in the demonstration.\n\nHe said that the budgetary allocation for fisheries was very minimal and almost 95 per cent of that went towards salaries of organisations under the fisheries department.\n\n\u201cOur contribution towards bringing foreign exchange is not taken into account. We want fisheries to be treated on a par with agriculture,\u201d Mr. Ilango added.",
