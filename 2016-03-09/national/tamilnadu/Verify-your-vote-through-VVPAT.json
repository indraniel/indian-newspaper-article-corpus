    "text": "On May 16, 2016, voters in parts of Vellore Assembly constituency will get a chance to verify if their votes were cast as they intended to. This Assembly election, the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which allows electors to verify their votes, will be introduced in 244 polling booths in Vellore Assembly constituency.\n\nOfficials said VVPAT was earlier introduced in a constituency in Chennai during the Lok Sabha elections. This will be the first time it will be implemented in Vellore.\n\n\u201cThrough VVPAT, voters will be able to see and verify for who they had voted for. Under VVPAT, there will be a separate machine placed alongside the ballot unit. Once a person casts his/her vote, this machine will start printing details of the candidate and his party symbol on a paper,\u201d an officer explained.\n\nHe added that the printed slip can be viewed by the voter for seven seconds, after which it will automatically cut and fall into a tray that is part the machine. The slip cannot be taken out by the voter, he said.\n\nAs many as 300 machines for VVPAT have arrived for use in the 244 booths of Vellore Assembly constituency.\n\nOnce the vote is cast, the machine will print details of the candidate and his party symbol",
