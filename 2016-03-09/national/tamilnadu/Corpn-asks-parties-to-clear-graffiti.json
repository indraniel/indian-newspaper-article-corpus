Most of the areas we screened had wall posters, which have been removed. Without the cooperation of political parties, the defacement will be a challenge in Chennai,\u201d said an election official.\n\nAs many as 9,223 spots have been cleared of defacement caused to government buildings in the 16 constituencies. Many spots were cleared multiple times in the past four days. Corporation workers removed party symbols at many locations. A total of 4,169 banners have also been reported to the district election office so far, officials said.\n\nAhead of the election announcement, political graffiti had sprung up everywhere. Some of the graffiti were removed by a few party functionaries last week. Owing to lack of manpower in each of the 107 wards in Chennai district, the election office has asked other political parties also to remove graffiti, posters and banners of their own accord.\n\n\u201cLocal statutory provisions do not permit defacement of any property. The Corporation officials have been given instructions that this should not be permitted, even under the pretext of consent of the owner of the private property being obtained,\u201d said an official.\n\nUsually, more than 10,000 private premises along arterial roads in the city are being illegally used for election campaign. \u201cWe are also creating awareness among owners of such property,\u201d said an official.\n\nA total of 4,169 banners have been reported to the district election office till date",
