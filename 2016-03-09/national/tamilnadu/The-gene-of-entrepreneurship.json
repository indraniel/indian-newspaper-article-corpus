    "text": "More women are getting into FAMILY BUSINESSES or starting NEW VENTURES\n\nWomen getting into family businesses or starting new ventures are not new to Coimbatore. But, what is interesting is that many of them now choose to become entrepreneurs and not as a compulsion.\n\n\u201cMy wife used to do embroidery work for a retailer in the city. And, now, for the last five years, she is into jewellery design. She went for training in designing diamond jewellery and is doing it from home,\u201d says a leading businessman here.\n\nThere are several young women who are educated and do not want to be idle at home. Hence, they are starting home-based businesses, says D. Nandakumar, president of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore.\n\nBe it home-made food, interior designs, jewellery designing, or financial advisory services, more women are getting into these segments.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common to find women heads of industries at industrial association meetings.\n\nWith several schemes by the government to encourage women entrepreneurship, the number of women starting industries is also increasing, says S. Asokan, general manager of District Industries\u2019 Centre, Coimbatore.\n\nV. Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers\u2019 Association, says that more number of women are getting into family businesses. There are women first generation entrepreneurs in rural areas too, starting small-scale industries.\n\nHowever, there is scope for more women to get into the manufacturing sector. One reason for the relatively less number, compared to the service sector, could be the risk factors involved in starting a manufacturing unit, he says.\n\nHowever, with better awareness the situation would improve.\n\n(Reporting by\n\nM.
