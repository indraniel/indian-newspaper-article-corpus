    "text": "Private engineering colleges are not expecting a fee revision in the next academic year as they feel a new government may play it safe.\n\nRepresentatives of these institutions, who participated in the exercise of determining an acceptable fee structure for the national committee are also not enthused.\n\nThe Justice Sri Krishna Fee Committee report, which is on the council\u2019s website, has provided break-up of the requirements for a college. It provides options for three categories of cities as classified by the VI Pay Commission.\n\nFor instance, the committee has fixed a maximum cap of Rs.1,44,900 to Rs.1,58,300 a year for colleges offering BE/B Tech, depending on where they are situated.\n\nBut private college officials say the guidelines will not apply as the new government that takes over may not revise the existing fee structure.\n\n\u201cFee revision was done in 2012 and it was due last year, but the government did not take it up. The committee\u2019s fee guideline is 60 per cent more than what the State government has fixed currently,\u201d reasons K. Paramasivam, president, Association of Managements of Coimbatore Anna University Affiliated Colleges. Since the council itself was in limbo for nearly a year , private engineering college representatives question the relevance of the report.\n\n\u201cWe have been representing repeatedly to Anna University about the difficult situation smaller colleges are in,\u201d says secretary of the association A.K. Natesan. \u201cAnna University has announced a scheme to upgrade colleges with new machinery. But many college buildings are hypothecated and we pay steep interest rates. It will be difficult to take up any improvement with the current fee structures,\u201d he adds.\n\nA college official in Puducherry said since the Union Territory also had a fee committee it was still uncertain whether the council\u2019s report would be taken as the last word. An AICTE official in the State also said the State government could decide whether to adopt the report\u2019s guidelines.\n\nS. Vaidhyasubramanian, Dean of Planning, SASTRA, however, felt that the committee\u2019s \u201crecommendation may be harmoniously adopted to ensure uniformity and encourage transparency.\u201d",
