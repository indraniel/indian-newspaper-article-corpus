    "text": "The Rs.-31 crore multi-level parking project of the Coimbatore Corporation is likely to take off only after the elections are over.\n\nCorporation sources say that the project report for the project had suggested automated parking lots on Cross Cut Road at Rs. 32.99 crore, on D.B. Road at Rs. 69.80 crore, and on Town Hall Road at Rs. 28.84 crore.\n\nAccording to the report, the facility at Cross Cut Road would have five floors for parking cars, two floors for commercial space, and a basement for parking two-wheelers. The five floors could accommodate 316 cars, and in the basement 350 two-wheelers.\n\nIn D.B. Road, there would be five levels of parking, two levels of commercial space, and a basement for two-wheelers. It would have 20 multi-level car parking elevators, and a commercial elevator.\n\nIn Town Hall, there would be four levels of car parking space, and a two-wheeler parking facility in the basement.\n\nThe report says the corporation would lease out the land to the highest bidder for 30 years to build the multi-level parking facility.\n\nThe investment could be recovered by way of parking fee, and rent from the commercial space.\n\nDuring the lease period, there could be a revenue sharing model with the civic body. Sources said that the corporation had submitted the proposal to the State Government.\n\nNow that the model code of conduct was in place, one could expect the order after the new government assumes office.",
