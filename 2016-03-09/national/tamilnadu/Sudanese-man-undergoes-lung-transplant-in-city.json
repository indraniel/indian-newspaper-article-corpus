Interstitial lung disease affects the tissue that supports the air sacs in the lungs.\n\nIn pulmonary arterial hypertension, a patient has high blood pressure in the arteries that go from the heart to the lungs. A transplant was the only option available to Mr. Humieda at this stage.\n\nAdmitted to Frontier Lifeline Hospital, Mr. Humieda was registered under the Tamil Nadu State Cadaver Transplantation programme. On February 2, Mr. Humieda received a lung from a 48-year-old woman who had been declared brain dead at another private hospital, after she had met with an accident.\n\nThe organ was transported to Frontier Lifeline within 10 minutes, and reached at 4.09 a.m. N. Madhu Shankar, consultant cardiac surgeon at the hospital, along with his team performed the transplant, in a procedure that lasted four hours.
