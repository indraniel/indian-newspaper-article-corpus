With the formation of the new taluks, parity in the numbers in Erode and Gobi Divisions has been created.\n\nErode Division will henceforth encompass Erode, Perundurai, Modakurichi and Kodumudi. Gobi Division has in its jurisdiction Gobi, Sathyamangalam, Bhavani and Anthiyur taluks.\n\nAnthiyur taluk was formed in 2012 with four blocks: Anthiyur, Athani, Burgur and Ammapet, by restructuring Gobi and Bhavani taluks, for the benefit of residents on Bargur hills.\n\nStaff have been transferred from elsewhere in the district to the new taluks",
