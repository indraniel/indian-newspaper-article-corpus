    "text": "The Mutharaiyar Ezhuchi Sangam, Chennai, has called for the inclusion of Mutharaiyars in the Most Backward Class list. Although the government has included Ambalakarar and Valaiyar, two groups of Mutharaiyars, in the MBC list, Mutharaiyars have been left out. This has affected the educational and job opportunities for Mutharaiyars, said B. Maaran, president of the sangam, addressing a press conference here. The association has called upon the government to conduct a proper enumeration of Mutharaiyars, which included 29 sub sects, in the State. The association urged political parties to field Mutharaiyars as their candidates in 23 constituencies.",
