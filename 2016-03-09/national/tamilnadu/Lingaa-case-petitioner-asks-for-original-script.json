Ravi Rathinam, who had filed a case alleging that Rajinikanth-starrer \u2018Lingaa\u2019 was copied from his script, has now filed a petition demanding \u2018Lingaa\u2019 team to produce the original script of the movie in court.\n\nThe case, presently being tried in Additional District Munsif Court here, came up for hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThe petitioner, his counsel and counsel of the four defendants, including Mr. Rajinikanth and film producer \u2018Rockline\u2019 Venkatesh, appeared for the hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, the counsel of Mr. Ravi Rathinam filed a petition demanding that the original script of the movie be produced by the filmmakers so that it could be compared with his script.\n\nAsking the defendants to respond to the petition, Judge N. Vishwanath postponed the hearing to Wednesday.\n\nMr. Ravi Rathinam had approached the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court prior to the release of the movie in December 2014. He had alleged that \u2018Lingaa\u2019 team had stolen the script he had prepared for a movie, named \u2018Mullai Vanam 999\u2019.",
