Now, we have started registering cases for violation model code of conduct,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rural district police registered 26 cases on Monday alone. So far, the police have registered 103 cases in rural areas.\n\nThe police said that even flag poles of political parties and the flags should be removed from public places. \u201cIf the pole had the colour pattern representing the party flag colours that should also be removed,\u201d Mr. Yadav added.\n\nSuperintendent of Police Vijayendra Bidari said that writing on walls of government buildings was not allowed. \u201cHowever, wall writing on private buildings with a written permission from the building owner and the Returning Officer was allowed in rural areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rural district police intercepted a few vehicles carrying money.
