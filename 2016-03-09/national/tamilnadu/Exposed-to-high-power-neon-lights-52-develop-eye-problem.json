    "text": "Fifty two people, including women and school students from Achunthanvayal, developed irritation in eyes and inability to open eyelids after they were exposed to high-power neon lights during Sivaratri festival at a village temple on Monday night.\n\nThe villagers, who returned home after the festival, developed severe irritation in their eyes when they woke up on Tuesday morning. They also struggled to open their eyelids and noticed that their eyes had turned red.\n\nThey were treated as outpatients at the Government District Headquarters Hospital here.\n\nAn ophthalmologist who treated them said that they had \u2018exposure keratitis\u2019 but there was no severe damage to the cornea. The infrared and ultraviolet rays from the powerful neon lights could have caused harm to the cornea, the doctor said.\n\n\u201cThere was no case of vision loss or morbidity,\u201d Hospital Superintendent K. Krishnamoorthy said. The affected people were given eye drops and tablets, he said, adding they were asked to come for a check-up if they had any problem in opening the eyelids or the irritation persisted.\n\nEaswari (20), one of the affected people, said that they remained awake beyond midnight and had no problem while taking part in the festival.\n\nWhen she could not open her eyes on Tuesday morning, she thought that she had conjunctivitis, but found that everyone who attended the festival in the village had the same problem, she said.",
