    "text": "Traders had a lot to lament over the implementation of the model code of conduct. They said that trade was badly affected across sectors as they have to show proof for carrying cash more than Rs. 50,000.\n\nAt a demonstration organised by traders\u2019 unions at ATC Ground in Udhagamandalam, the traders said that the district was dependent on plains to buy and sell essential commodities.\n\nTraders said that they buy vegetables from Gundalpet in Karnataka and Mettupalayam and sold vegetables grown in The Nilgiris in the plains. All these were cash transactions. It was difficult to show proof for the transactions. District president of the consortium of traders unions, R. Parameswaran, led the demonstration.",
