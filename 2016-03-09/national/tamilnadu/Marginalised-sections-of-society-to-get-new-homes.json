Beneficiaries too contribute their sweat equity and build homes and toilets, said Rajan Samuel, Managing Director, Habitat for Humanity India (HFH India). The activity launched on February 29 will go on till March 14. It is part of the NGO\u2019s Women\u2019s Week Celebrations, 2016 coinciding with the International Women\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cYearning a house with proper sanitation facilities is a deep desire of all women across the country. By providing access to decent housing and sanitation facilities, we intend to improve health and provide security for the whole family which is a major step in helping improve their lives,\u201d Mr. Samuel said.\n\nThe 2015 rains had destroyed several homes in Chettikuppam at Puducherry. Since 2005, HFH India has built more than 1,000 homes here benefitting over 4,000 individuals. HFH India is building 11 more homes in this village.",
