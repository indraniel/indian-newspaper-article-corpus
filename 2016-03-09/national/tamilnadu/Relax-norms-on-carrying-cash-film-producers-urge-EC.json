Since we are involved in shooting films, we requested the Election Commission to give exemption and allow Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh for small films and Rs. 5 lakh to Rs.10 lakh for big films,\u201d TFPC president \u2018Kalaipuli\u2019 S. Thanu said. He also sought the Commission to allow the exemption given by the government on entertainment tax for films that have been certified as \u2018U\u2019. \u201cThe MCC should not affect this,\u201d he said. Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said he would look into the issues. Since the Model Code of Conduct came into force on March 4, about 800 complaints have been received by the Commission alleging violations by parties and individuals.\n\nThey demand permission to carry Rs. 2 lakh to Rs.10 lakh in cash for shooting films",
