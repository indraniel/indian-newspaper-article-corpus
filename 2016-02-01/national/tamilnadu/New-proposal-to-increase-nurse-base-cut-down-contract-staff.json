Currently, of the 10,000 nurses on contract, 3,500 have completed more than five years.\n\nThe qualified \u2018merit candidate\u2019 nurses are recruited on a consolidated pay of Rs. 7,700 and in rural areas an additional Rs. 500 is included. They receive a five per cent annual hike on their salary.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Tamil Nadu Government Contract Nurses Welfare Association suspended its strike for 10 days after the Health Minister\u2019s assurance that their demands would be addressed.\n\nThe government has promised placements through counselling within a week for 809 nurses, who have served more than six years, and within 10 days another 2,607 nurses with over five years\u2019 service would be regularised.\n\nAssociation president R. Marimuthu, however, said the government could accommodate all contract nurses by following the Medical Council of India norms.\n\nIn PHCs, the government must create at least six permanent posts, as contract nurses often work more than 12 hours.\n\n\u201cIf in intensive care, critical care, cardiac care, neonatal and neuro intensive care units, the ratio of 1:1 patient to nurse is maintained quality care can be assured. The eight hours a nurse spends there ensures the patient is fed, cleaned, medicated and vital signs are monitored,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a health official, new schemes such as the rural health mission, communicable diseases project, neonatal intensive care and comprehensive emergency and obstetric care necessitated recruitment of nurses on contract.\n\nBut that anomaly was being set right steadily and the government had, in the past year, considerably reduced the ratio of nurse to contract nurse to 1:3.\n\nWith the government proposing to launch two new medical colleges in Pudukottai and Karur, 600 new nurse posts would be created.\n\nThe government is also sending a proposal to the Centre seeking higher salaries for nurses under the National Rural Health Mission, he said.\n\nGovernment has promised to appoint over 3000 nurses through counselling",
