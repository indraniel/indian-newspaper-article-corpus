    "text": "Coimbatore International Airport is all set to have more shops and stalls for the convenience of passengers. An outlet selling ayurvedic medicines is expected to start operations from this month. The terminal building will also all set to get the third ATM inside the security hold area.\n\nOf the more than two dozen commercial outlets selling a range of items from snacks and confectionaries to silk saris and jewellery, three stalls in departure and four in the arrival areas are vacant. It is because the shops are rented out on a six month tender period. Shops remained closed till a new vendor bid through the tender system and occupied the shop. This gave a tough experience for passengers.\n\nIt is learnt that there will also be a change in the contractor who runs the restaurant at the airport terminal building, in a couple of months. Airport Authority of India (AAI) has come out with a new mechanism to have more amenities for passengers on a long term basis, which also make administration easier for the AAI. Airport Director G. Prakash Reddy said that in the new system they have floated two tenders separately for food and beverage and another for retail shops. \u201cThe winning bidder who will start operations from the beginning of the next financial year will be allotted space in the terminal building. The contractor would then allot space to sub contractors (sub vendors),\u201d he said.\n\nThe new system is also aimed at making optimum use of unused space on the airport premises.",
