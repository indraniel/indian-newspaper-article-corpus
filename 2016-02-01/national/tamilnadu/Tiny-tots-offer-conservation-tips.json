Whenever a tree is cut, let\u2019s plant a new one,\u201d she said. Girishanth R., another student of the same class said, \u201cIf trees are cut there is a disruption in the food chain and water cycle.\u201d The students of class five had displayed structures and charts on national and international parks.\n\nThere was also a display on forests and the tribes. These students had put out an exhibit of vanishing tribes, details on tribal festivals and they had also carved tribal instruments with coconut shells. Visitors were excited about the charts by class IX students.\n\nThe main building of the school was also decorated to resemble a real forest. Spic Promoter A.C. Muthiah, who was the chief guest for the event, said he was inspired seeing all the exhibits. He also lauded the school\u2019s Chairman V. Shankar for his novel ideas.",
