She filled the garbage in a discarded and broken suitcase, thinking she would cart it outside the airport.\n\nBut she found it inconvenient to carry the huge suitcase. She emptied the waste in a plastic bag and abandoned the suitcase near the administrative block. The CISF came across the bag while inspecting the premises and sounded an alert. P.S. Harsha, DCP (north east), said, \u201cIt was negligence on the part of the staff who had discarded the suitcase inside the airport premises.\u201d The employee was questioned.",
