    "text": "Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists\u2019 Associations has appealed to both the Union and State Governments to stop the import of cooking/edible oil and instead promote the oils extracted from indigenously grown crops.\n\nC. Nallasamy, secretary of the federation, told reporters the country had been importing 1.44 crore tonnes of cooking/edible oil per annum and the same was disbursed at subsidised rates.\n\nAccording to him, the projections indicate that the cooking oil imports will be increasing by around 11 per cent this annum. \u201cInstead of subsidising an imported product, the government should take steps to promote distribution of oils made from coconut, groundnut and gingelly, through public distribution system and other sales avenues\u201d, he said. This was essential to sustain the acreage under various crops. The federation also called for increasing support prices already fixed for various crops.",
