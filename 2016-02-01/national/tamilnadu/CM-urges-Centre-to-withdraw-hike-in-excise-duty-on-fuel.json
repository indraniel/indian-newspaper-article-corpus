    "text": "A day after the excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked by Re. 1 and Rs. 1.50 respectively, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday said it had become a \u201croutine\u201d for the Central government to hike it and urged for its withdrawal.\n\nPointing out that the excise duty on petrol and diesel were increased by Rs. 11.77 and Rs. 13.57 respectively, since November 2014 and Rs. 2.12 and Rs. 5.50 respectively within this month, Ms. Jayalalithaa said, in a statement, it was \u201cnot fair\u201d on the part of the Central government to hike the excise duty to reduce the deficit in revenue.\n\nAs withdrawing the hike in excise duty would lead to revival of economic growth in the country, she said, \u201cI insist that the excise duty hike must be withdrawn keeping the long-term interest of economic growth in mind and the Central government should change its narrow perspective of hiking excise duty for reducing revenue deficit.\u201d\n\nThough many States hiked their sales tax on fuel following the Central government, her government has not followed suit and so sales tax in the State was the lowest among the southern States, she claimed.\n\nFaulty fuel pricing\n\nMs. Jayalalithaa further reiterated her demand to change the \u201cfaulty\u201d pricing of fuel adopted by the erstwhile UPA government, which was being followed by the present government.\n\n\u2018It is not fair on the part of the Centre to hike the excise duty to reduce deficit in revenue\u2019",
