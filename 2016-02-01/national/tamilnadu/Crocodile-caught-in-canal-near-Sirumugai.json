    "text": "The crocodile that was rescued from a canal near Sirumugai in Coimbatore on Saturday night.\n\nVillagers of Kutharipalayam village near Sirumugai caught a small crocodile that strayed into the village through a canal on Saturday night.\n\nThe village is close to the banks of River Bhavani and a canal from the river flows to the village for irrigation. Around 9.30 p.m. on Saturday, Yuvaraj (27) from that village was on foot on the banks of the canal on his way to his friend\u2019s place.\n\nHe heard some strange sound in the canal and turned on the flash light on his mobile phone and saw a six-foot-long crocodile. He alerted villagers. A few youth and farmers of the locality struggled for about two hours to catch it using a rope. They lifted the reptile that weighed about 70 kg from the water and informed the forest department personnel.\n\nDepartment personnel led by Sirumugai Ranger B. Srinivasan then released it in the Bhavani catchment area. The department personnel are also enquiring on how the lone crocodile had come there.",
