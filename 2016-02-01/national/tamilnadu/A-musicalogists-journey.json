But it is very difficult to ward off distractions caused by the aroma of food prepared in the kitchen and mellifluous Mohanam from his mobile phone while listening to this musicologist recollect the octaves and sextets in the musical journey of his life from Idaikal near Courtallam in Tirunelveli district to Madurai. After numerous articles and seven books on Tamil music since his retirement as Superintendent in the Department of Highways on December 31, 2004, the crowning glory being the celebrated Tamil Isai Peragarathi, N. Mammathu is currently working on an exposition of 100 ragas to be published by the Tamil Music Research Centre of Thiagarajar College.\n\nMr. Mammathu tells S. Annamalai what attracted him to music and who inspired him to do research.\n\nThe genetic reason for the music flowing in him is his father, a successful farmer and businessman and a lover of music in any form. \u201cI did not have to go out in search of music in my young age. Music was an integral part of life. People were surrounded by music in villages. Every woman born in Tamil Nadu was a singer then and I could hear lullaby at any time of night in my village. Even death featured 16 days of dirge. Temple festivals were filled with music in the form of \u2018villu pattu\u2019 or \u2018karagattam,\u2019\u201d recalls Mr. Mammathu. The love for music transformed into a passion for musicology during his undergraduate days at MDT Hindu College, Tirunelveli, where he came into contact with scholars of repute and C.S. Mani, an employee of Department of Posts. \u201cMani was a person with vast knowledge and extraordinary memory. We used to assemble at his house on Friday evenings to listen to discourses on various topics. It was Mani who initiated me into musicology as he felt that there were very few musicologists in the State.\u201d\n\nFrom his college days, he started to collect books on music. His postal service took him to many towns in Tamil Nadu and when he came to Madurai he realised that he had \u201creached a 2000-year-old city of arts, temples, festivals and stone inscriptions.\u201d \u201cThis is a living city, the seat of music. It was here the trimurtis of Tamil music \u2014 Sankaradas, Viswanathadas and Baskaradas \u2014 lived.\u201d But the turning point was his association with eminent musicologist, V. P. K. Sundaram, a professor of American College and author of Tamil Isai Kalaikalanjiyam published by Bharatidasan University for 20 years. In between, he obtained a postgraduate degree in Philosophy and Religion and M. Phil. in Sufi music from Madurai Kamaraj University.\n\nExplaining the evolution of Tamil music, he says that five of the seven \u2018melakartha ragas\u2019 belong to each of the five Tamil landscapes \u2014 Kurinji, Mullai, Marutham, Neithal and Paalai \u2014 with an additional raga each for Neithal and Marutham. This additional raga is co-terminus with two capitals \u2014 on the coast and inland \u2014 the ancient Tamil kings had. The Pandyas had Korkkai and Madurai, Cholas Poompuhar and Woriyur and Cheras Musiri and Vanchi. Mohanam was the first raga of Tamils.\n\nChina\u2019s prima raga\n\n\u201cRagas are universal. China\u2019s prime raga is Mohanam. Its national anthem is in Mohanam,\u201d he says. Mr. Mammathu says that there cannot be a debate over which music is ancient. \u201cTamil music has different genres \u2014 folk, dance, theatre, light, devotional and chamber. These are the primary forms of music which can be sung in any language. But the elite have popularised chamber music. This does not mean that other genres are inferior.\u201d\n\nTurning to popular film music, Mr. Mammathu is of the firm view that one should not be critical of contemporary music. \u201cEvery era comes up with a form of music that signifies a change in popular taste. The era dominated by the likes of G. Ramanathan churned out pure Carnatic music and M.S. Viswanathan made it light. Ilayaraja infused folk music and A. R. Rahman is known for fusion music.\u201d While affirming that music is universal, Mr. Mammathu says that a researcher should not be influenced by the love for his mother tongue.\n\n\u201cWhen he came to Madurai, he realised that he had reached a 2000-year-old city of arts, temples, festivals and stone inscriptions\u201d",
