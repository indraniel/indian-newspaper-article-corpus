    "text": "Referring to the corruption charges against the AIADMK and the DMK regimes, Vaiko, general secretary of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), said the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) will put an end to corruption if voted to power.\n\nIt will take initiatives to retrieve the wealth amassed by the leaders of both the parties through corrupt practices, he said at a public meeting here on Saturday evening.\n\nCorruption can be eliminated in the State only when people have an alternative thinking. Youth and social thinkers should think independently, in an unbiased manner, and take a good decision in extending support in the forthcoming Assembly elections, he added.\n\nThe recent conference of the PWF held at Madurai was a big hit and its success had created jitters among both the AIADMK and the DMK. He alleged that money played a major role in pursuing education, getting treatment in hospitals, and for achieving all basic needs. Hence, people should lend support to the PWF to put an end to such a situation.\n\nLaunching a scathing attack on the DMK, he said that the prohibition policy of that party is unacceptable. The DMK assured to implement total prohibition in the State in 1996, but did nothing in this direction despite ruling the State for ten long years.\n\nAt present, 47 per cent population of the State has become liquor addict and PWF alone will deliver the goods and introduce total prohibition in the State, he added.",
