    "text": "Thousands of workers in Tirupur knitwear cluster are a worried lot as the new wage agreement has not been arrived at, even though the previous four-year agreement came to an end on January 30.\n\n\u201cIt is pathetic that every time the wage pacts end, the new one is not signed immediately though the owners know well in advance when the agreement period comes to a close. They come for negotiations with the trade unions at the last minute and drag on the talks by quoting very minimal increase in slabs.\n\nBy the time the talks end, a significant period would have lapsed and the entrepreneurs seldom agree to pay the increased wages with retrospective effect from the date of expiry of the previous wage pact\u201d, N. Sekar, district president of All India Trade Union Congress, told The Hindu .\n\nThe trade unionists pointed out that during the previous occasion when the wage pact ended on December 31, 2010, the new wage pact came into existence a year later. The representatives of various textiles associations have extended an increase of 19 per cent spread over four years from the previous pact.\n\n\u201cWe have put forward the proposal for an upward revision of 10 per cent during the first year and three per cent each for the next three years\u201d, said M. P. Muthurathinam, president of Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association, which is one among the six textile associations involved in the wage revision talks with eight trade unions.\n\nThe trade unions wanted an increase of wages not from the slabs fixed during the previous four-year pact but from the existing State government-fixed minimum wages and also wanted a few other perks.",
