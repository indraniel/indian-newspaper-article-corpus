Sesu Raja, a fishermen leader said.\n\nThe fishing companies, mostly from Kerala, refused to engage the load men of the two unions as they demanded Rs. 10,000 for loading 10 tonnes of fish on to a truck, when the rate ranged from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000 at Pamban, Kanyakumari and Nagercoil.\n\nFishermen leaders said that the two unions, which had about 150 load men as members, monopolised loading operation.\n\nWhen the boat owners and the fishing companies engaged outsiders, they collected a commission of Rs. 3,000 per truck, they complained.",
