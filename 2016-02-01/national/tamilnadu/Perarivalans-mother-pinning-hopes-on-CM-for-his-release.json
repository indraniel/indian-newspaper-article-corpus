Perarivalan, a convict in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, exuded hope that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will invoke Article 161 of the Constitution to release him and six other convicts before the elections to Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Minister\u2019s initiative to secure release of the seven convicts was thwarted by the then Congress Government one-and-a-half years ago, but the decision of the subsequent BJP government to toe the line has given room for the thought that the Central government was prejudiced against Tamils.\n\nWhen life convicts were being released after 14 years in other States, there was no reason why Tamil Nadu should not follow suit,\u201d Ms. Arputhammal told journalists Sunday.\n\nShe was here to address a public meeting calling for the release of the seven convicts. \u201cMy son has been in prison for the last 25 years for a crime he has not committed. The officers who had arrested him also have made known their views that Perarivalan does not deserve the prolonged incarceration,\u201d Ms. Arputhammal said.\n\n\u2018No parole\u2019\n\nHer son wished to be released after being freed of the charges and did not desire a parole. \u201cAt a time when a group of cinema directors sought appointment with the Chief Minister for obtaining her nod for a rally in support of the convicts, I do not intend to disturb her in person,\u201d she added.\n\nShe hopes Jayalalithaa will invoke Article 161 before election",
