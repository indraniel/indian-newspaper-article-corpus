    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not desperate for an electoral alliance, Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Pon. Radhakrishnan claimed in Coimbatore on Sunday.\n\nAddressing reporters here, he said that the party was working for an alliance as an alternative to the AIADMK and DMK, as in the past 50 years the two had provided very poor governance. Parties that shared the BJP\u2019s objective were welcome to be a part of the alliance. To a question, he said the Pattali Makkal Katchi announcing Anbumani Ramadoss as its Chief Ministerial candidate reflected its confidence and added that leaders of parties looking for alliance should not make leadership an ego issue.\n\nCondemning the attack on expelled AIADMK MLA Pala Karuppaiah\u2019s house in Chennai, he said that he should get police protection. Asked if the party would welcome Mr. Karuppaiah into its fold, he said this would be the latter\u2019s prerogative. He claimed that in Tamil Nadu, the BJP had ensured that more than 1,300 fishermen, arrested by Sri Lanka, were released in the last one-and-half years and was working to providing a permanent solution to the issue. Mr. Radhakrishnan came down heavily upon Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his stand on the suicide of Hyderabad University student Rohit Vemula. Mr. Gandhi was moving around like a pilot-less ship in the high-seas. There seemed to be no clarity on his stand.\n\nThe Minister later took out a rally to welcome people to the Prime Minister\u2019s public meeting near CODISSIA Trade Fair complex on Tuesday. Former MP C.P. Radhakrishnan, and BJP leaders Nandhakumar and S.R. Sekar accompanied him.",
