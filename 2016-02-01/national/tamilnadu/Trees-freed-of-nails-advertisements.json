Siva Saravanan\n\nAs drum beats filled the air on a pleasant Sunday morning, citizens of Coimbatore gathered on D.B. Road with nail pullers and pliers. \u2018Jollya Clean Pannalaam Vaanga\u2019, an initiative to free the trees in the area of the numerous advertisement boards nailed on them, was the agenda.\n\n\u201cThis initiative is part of Swachh Bharat cleaning efforts,\u201d said CGS Manion, one of the 30 Swachh Bharat Ambassadors for Coimbatore.\n\nThough such efforts have been taken in the past, boards are still being nailed. \u201cAwareness has to be created so that different residents\u2019 associations can take it up and carry it forward in their areas,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cEach of us has a responsibility to make sure that the boards are taken down. People need to understand that lives are entrapped under these trees,\u201d said Vanitha Mohan, managing trustee of the NGO Siruthuli.\n\nK. Vijayakarthikeyan, Commissioner, Coimbatore Corporation, urged the residents to take up the initiative. \u201cThe citizens need to take up this effort and make sure that this is not an one-time affair, but a practice for the years to come.\u201d\n\nThe initiative heads to Valangulam on February 13 and then proceeds to Saibaba Colony, Vadavalli, and a few other areas.\n\nTo join the cause, the Swacch Bharat Ambassadors can be contacted at 95009-59090 and 96777-00081.",
