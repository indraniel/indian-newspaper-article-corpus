Venkatachalapathy of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS).\n\n\u201cDrunk with power after winning a brutal majority in the 1971 Assembly elections, the DMK regime suppressed people\u2019s movements and trade union activities, exemplified by the handling of workers strike in the Simpson's factory,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, agreed that Mr. Karunanidhi showed equanimity of a great leader in the face of crisis during the Emergency and helped the party overcome the difficulties.\n\nR. Kannan, biographer of DMK founder C.N. Annadurai, said adversity brings out the best and the Emergency did that to the DMK. \u201cIt was a period of great adversity albeit a brief one, but it required enormous strength of character, fortitude, will power and the willingness to suffer and accept serious privations,\u201d he said.",
