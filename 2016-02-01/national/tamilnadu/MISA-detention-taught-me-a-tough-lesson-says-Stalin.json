Karunanidhi as a political leader at the national level and he ensured that the party did not disintegrate.\u2014 File Photo\n\nFor DMK leaders Sunday marked the 40th anniversary of the dismissal of the Karunanidhi government when the country was reeling under the impact of the Emergency declared by the Indira Gandhi government. And Monday would mark the 40th year of the first set of detentions of prominent DMK functionaries under the draconian Maintenance of Internal Securities Act (MISA) that was in force then. Among those detained was a young M.K. Stalin, who at that time was an ordinary party member.\n\n\u201cI was in Maduranthakam performing a play on behalf of the youth wing of the DMK when the police came looking for me in Chennai. My father told them that I was out of town and promised to hand over me once I reached Chennai. I was arrested on February 1 after my father called the City Police Commissioner to inform about my arrival,\u201d recalled Stalin. As the cadre across the State was not fully aware of the arrests of party leaders and the DMK mouthpiece \u2018Murasoli\u2019 was censored from publishing anything political, Mr. Karunanidhi merely published a list of names of leaders, announcing that they would not be in a position to pay tribute to party founder C.N. Annadurai on his death anniversary (February 3). The party men got the message.\n\n\u201cPrison life taught me a great political lesson, though I had to pay a heavy price. I was beaten mercilessly and former Mayor Chittibabu, who formed a shield to protect me, later succumbed to the injuries. I have a scar on my right hand and it has become one of the permanent body marks for identification,\u201d Mr. Stalin, who was catapulted to the centre stage of the DMK, said.\n\nDravidian scholar K. Thirunavukkarasu recalled that the Emergency and subsequent dismissal of the government created a situation in which the DMK was forced to function like an underground organisation. \u201cBut it also helped the party identify who would stand by the party in the face of oppression,\u201d said the veteran, who used to print pamphlets, which would then be smuggled into the prisons to keep the party men abreast of developments outside as newspapers were censored.\n\nNational stature\n\nThe Emergency also saw the emergence of Mr. Karunanidhi as a political leader at the national level. He ensured the party did not disintegrate.\n\n\u201cThere was a suggestion that he should step down as the leader of the party to pave way for its control under a committee of leaders. Many leaders, including V.R. Nedunchezhian, mooted the idea of changing the name of the party to escape further onslaught. Mr. Karunanidhi rejected them and single-handedly managed the crisis,\u201d said Mr. Thirunavukkarasu.\n\nHe used to function from Anbagam, now the headquarters of the party\u2019s youth wing, meeting leaders and cadres and coordinating with national leaders who had gone underground.\n\n\u2018It helped the party identify who\n\nwill stand by it in the face of opression\u2019",
