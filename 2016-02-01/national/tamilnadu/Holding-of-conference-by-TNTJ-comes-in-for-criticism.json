The Imams should also take advantage of the Friday sermons to inform the Muslims the right tenets of Islam.\n\nAnother resolution called upon the people not to attach importance to the assurances of freebies and instead extend support to the political outfits / alliance which assured implementation of total prohibition in the state in the forthcoming Assembly election.",
