    "text": "Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce that the city would get a world class university. Party\u2019s State youth wing secretary V. Easwaran has said in a letter to Mr. Modi that he should take steps to establish the university, an announcement the previous United Progressive Alliance government made.\n\nHe said that in March 2008, the Ministry of Human Resource Development said that it proposed to establish the university at Rs. 3,000 crore.\n\n\u2018Announcement welcomed\u2019\n\nand Coimbatore widely welcomed the announcement because it did not have any institution like the IITs, IIMs or the IISc.\n\nThe announcement also gave way to expectation that the establishment of such an institution would lead to overall development of education in the region.\n\n\u2018Bill still pending\u2019\n\nThe then government said that it would establish the university once Parliament passed the Bill in this regard. But, the Bill was still pending.\n\nMr. Easwaran wanted the Centre to revive the proposal and make an announcement during the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the city on Tuesday. He also wanted the government to take steps to prevent the privatisation of Avinashilingam University.",
