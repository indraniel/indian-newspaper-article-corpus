    "text": "Residents of Adyar wanted the rusted and abandoned street lamp posts on pavements in Indira Nagar removed immediately.\n\nNot only have the lamp posts completely taken away the pavement space, but they also pose a serious risk to pedestrians\u2019 safety, residents complained. The posts have been dumped outside the office of Junior Engineer on First Avenue.\n\n\u201cThe posts have been lying there for a long time and we are unable to complain as the engineer\u2019s office is locked,\u201d said R. Gopal, a resident. The office premises is dumped with wires, street junction boxes, and domestic meters. \u201cThere is a complete breakdown of law and order around this area. Pedestrians, especially senior citizens face the risk of being run over by the speeding vehicles on the road. After sunset, the area around the office becomes a den for miscreants,\u201d complained S. Narayanan, another resident. Corporation officials said they will remove the abandoned and rusted pavements at the earliest and also take steps to ensure that the office of junior engineer becomes functional again.",
