Though he asked for half-fare tickets for his children, the conductor issued them full-fare tickets as he was reportedly advised to issue only full-fare tickets since it was festival season, Mr. Selvan claimed in his application.\n\nAlleging that this amounted to deficiency in the service offered, he claimed compensation for the mental agony he had undergone. He produced the tickets and documents to prove their age and that they were his children. The respondent transport corporation stated there was no such advice to the conductor and he had only issued full-fare tickets, as asked for by the applicant.\n\nAfter examining the documents produced by both sides, the forum comprising its president A. Ayyappan, members V. Meenambigai and M.H. Sheik Abdul Khader held that there was deficiency in the service offered.\n\n\u201cWhile issuing tickets, any conductor is supposed to check whether the passenger is an adult and in this case too, the conductor should have checked but he has not checked. And his statement that four persons were seen seated in two seats only proves he has not checked whether they were children or adults,\u201d the forum said.\n\nHolding that there was a case of deficiency in service offered to the customer, the forum directed the transport corporation to pay a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to the passenger for the mental agony he underwent, the repayment of the excess fare collected and Rs. 2,000 as litigation costs.\n\nHe was denied half fare tickets to children",
