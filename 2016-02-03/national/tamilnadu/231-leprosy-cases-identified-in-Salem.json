This was disclosed during the National Anti-Leprosy Day observation here on Monday.\n\nAs part of the observation, Collector flagged off an awareness rally at the Collectorate in which over 750 students, volunteers and medical staff participated.\n\nParticipants carried placards that said that leprosy could be diagnosed with common symptoms such as pale, patch spots on face, hands and feet and asked the affected people to approach the government hospitals immediately.\n\nOfficials said that leprosy, if left untreated, could lead to numbness in hands and treatment is essential. Participants also highlighted the importance of getting medical attention at the preliminary stage so that leprosy could be treated properly. The rally passed through Tiruvalluvar Statue, Old Corporation office, Government Hospital and culminated at Nattamai Kazhagam building. Pamphlets were also distributed to the people. At the end of the rally, Collector garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the premises.\n\nA.K.
