    "text": "Forest officials on Tuesday rescued two female elephants from an earthen muddy trough in Booluvampatti range of forests near here. The two elephants were aged about 18 and eight years and were part of a herd of 11 wild elephants.\n\nThe trough is about 50 metre inside the reserve forest and is six feet deep and filled with water for nearly five feet. Forest officials said the younger elephant could have ventured into the trough and the older probably also got trapped while trying to rescue it.\n\nOn hearing the trumpeting sound of the herd, villagers rushed and found two elephants trapped and the rest of the herd waiting at some distance. Following an alert from the villagers, 25 forest personnel got an earthmover and commenced rescue operations led by Ranger C. Dinesh Kumar. \u201cThe older elephant rested its trunk just above the trough and younger one rested its trunk on the older one\u2019s body and both managed to keep breathing,\u201d he says.\n\nInitially, the earthmover was used to create a slope and to drain the water from trough. The older elephant managed to climb up but its efforts to rescue the younger one went in vain. Frustrated, it turned ferocious and started chasing the forest personnel who had to abandon the operations for a while. Then, they burst firecrackers to chase the herd and managed to rescue the younger one.\n\n\u201cThe two elephants joined the herd and gave the \u2018happy call\u2019,\u201d Mr. Dinesh said. \u201cThe animals were not injured in the rescue operations,\u201d he added.",
