They said that with class X and Plus Two public examinations only a few weeks away, the proposed move to relocate them will affect students.\n\nThe meeting was convened at Kottur Gardens park with residents interacting with officials from Chennai Collectorate, Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, Public Works and Revenue Department and representatives from non-governmental organisations and political parties.\n\n\u2018Poor being targeted\u2019\n\nThe government, according to G. Selva of Communist Party of India (Marxist), was targeting houses of only the poor, while going soft on recreational centres and commercial establishments.\n\nThe locality was located 132 feet away from the banks of the river, but other permanent multi-storey buildings were ignored.\n\nHe also took strong exception to officials\u2019 announcement that Chennai would be made slum-free in two years.\n\nOfficials tried to convince the families that shifting to the tenements in Perumbakkam that had allocated for Surya Nagar families would be the safest option.\n\nOfficials said 1,015 families of Surya Nagar were living on government land on the edge of the Adyar river. They were being offered better housing with better amenities.\n\nThe slum-free programme was part of the central government-assisted housing for all.",
