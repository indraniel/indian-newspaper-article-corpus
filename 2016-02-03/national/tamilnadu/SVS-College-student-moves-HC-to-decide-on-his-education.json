    "text": "The Madras High Court on Tuesday ordered notice to the State government on a plea moved by a student of SVS Medical College of Yoga and Naturopathy, Villupuram, seeking a direction to the government either to take over the institution or transfer him to any other government college so that he could continue his education.\n\nThe petition has been filed despite Chief Minister Jayalalithaa recently announcing that students of the college will be accommodated in government colleges.\n\nThe petitioner, S. Ravi Kumar, who is studying second year at the college , submitted that his college has been sealed following the death of three girl students. Justice R. Subbaiah, ordered notice to the respondents and adjourned the case by two weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Registrar of Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University P. Arumugam said preliminary work has been completed and the list of students had been sent to the Commissionerate of the Indian Systems of Medicine under whose purview the college falls.",
