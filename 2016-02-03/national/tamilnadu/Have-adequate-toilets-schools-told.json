The City Health Office will be the nodal agency to collect details on number of toilets available in the schools. A data base will be created on sanitary facilities in the schools. It will ascertain whether the schools have provided toilets in proportion to the number of students or not.\n\nAs per the move, the schools will be asked to furnish information on number of toilets, pupils\u2019 strength and others. The schools will be subsequently inspected by officials to verify their claims.\n\nA senior official of the Tiruchi Corporation told The Hindu that the schools should have toilets in proportion to the strength of students. They should follow the prescribed norms of the government in providing sanitary facility to the students.\n\nThe schools that did not have sufficient number of toilets would be asked to improve the facility. They should meet the toilet criteria while applying for mandatory sanitary certificates. It was a high time for schools to increase the number of toilets as they would carry out repairs and maintenance work during the summer vacation.",
