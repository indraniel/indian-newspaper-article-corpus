Navab Khan was convicted in October 2007 for his role in the serial bomb blasts in the city in 1998. It was learnt that prison authorities received a tip off on use of mobile phones. During the drive they carried out on Sunday, the convict lodged in the high security block was said to have prevented prison staff from carrying out their duty and threatening them.\n\nPrison authorities claimed that they recovered a mobile phone and SIM cards from his possession. The prison authorities also asked the city police to register a case against Navab Khan for threatening prison staff and intimidating them. They claimed that this was not the first instance a contraband item was seized from the convict, who has also been warned, counselled and punished for violating the prison norms.",
