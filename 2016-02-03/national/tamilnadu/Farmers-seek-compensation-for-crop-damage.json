Nallakannu, laid siege to Kovilpatti Revenue Divisional Office on Tuesday, demanding adequate compensation for crop damage suffered by farmers.\n\nWhile talking to presspersons, Mr. Nallakannu said farmers suffered heavy loss after their crops were damaged by heavy rains during the Northeast monsoon last year.\n\nFarmers had taken up cultivation of rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram and maize anticipating rains. But excessive rainfall caused extensive damage to crops.\n\nHence, farmers were unhappy with the compensation declared by the government.\n\nCiting this, he sought the government to provide compensation of Rs. 20,000 per acre of rainfed tracts.\n\nStating that there were about four lakh farmers in the district, he said compensation was given only to 60,000 farmers and sought benefits to all affected farmers.\n\nA petition to this effect was given to Kovilpatti RDO S. Kannabiran.",
