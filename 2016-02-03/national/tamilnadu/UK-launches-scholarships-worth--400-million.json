There are over 490,000 foreign students from 200 countries studying there. Over 1,50,000 of them are Indians. I hope students and parents will use the one-day exhibition to meet the U.K. universities and find out more about the opportunities which are suited to them,\u201d said Mei Kwei Barker, director South India, British Council India.\n\nOver the past few years, the officials have identified over 90 colleges in the United Kingdom that are allegedly functioning illegally.\n\nTo avoid students from making wrong choices, they have listed out only accredited institutions on their website.\n\n\u201cNot only this, we are also holding weekly career briefing sessions to encourage prospective students to be vigilant and independent. In the past, we have come across cases where many fell victims to bogus agents and colleges. The fair will also have a session addressing this issue. We hope people make best use of it,\u201d said Sonu Hemanii, senior manager education UK, South India.\n\nThe fair will also be held in Bangalore, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Pune and Kochi in the coming months.",
