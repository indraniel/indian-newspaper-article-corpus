    "text": "The driver of the Indian Ambassador to France Mohan Kumar, who was on an official visit to the city, had to cough up Rs.500 as bribe to a person who claimed to be a policeman.\n\nOn Monday night, Mr. Mohan Kumar went in his car to catch some breeze from the most famous beach of Puducherry. He alighted from the car near Dupleix statue since vehicles are prohibited from 6 p.m.\n\nWhen he left for a walk from there, his driver parked the vehicle, which has a Tamil Nadu registration number, nearby.\n\nAccording to sources, a person came there claiming that he was policeman and said that he had parked his vehicle in a no-parking area. He then demanded Rs.500 to be let off without a case.\n\nAfter pocketing the money from the driver, the man vanished.\n\nThe matter was later taken up with high-ranking police officers.",
