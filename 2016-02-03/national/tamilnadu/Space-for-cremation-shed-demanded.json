Bhuvaneshwari on Tuesday seeking a space for creating a cremation shed for their community at Vellakovil cremation ground, as allotted to other communities.\n\nThe petitioners said that over 300 families of \u2018Maruththuvar\u2019 community were living in Palayamkottai area, but they did not have a separate cremation shed as the Corporation had not allotted a space for it as had been done in the case of other communities in the past.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone from our community dies, we\u2019ve to approach other community leaders to get their permission for using the cremation shed being used by them. Hence, the Corporation should allot a space for constructing cremation shed exclusively for \u2018Maruththuvar\u2019 community at Vellakovil cremation ground on the banks of the Tamirabharani,\u201d said R. Subbiah, president of the sangam.",
