    "text": "A meeting on constructing an elevated parking facility at Tirunelveli Junction bus-stand was conducted at the Collectorate on Tuesday.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Collector M. Karunakaran said a team of experts inspected the bus stand recently for constructing elevated parking facility for bikes and four-wheelers since parking of vehicles in and around the bus terminus was a nagging issue for the past several years. The problem worsens during festival seasons with the influx of more vehicles.\n\nAs per the proposal submitted by experts, good number of pillars would be erected to create a concrete floor at a 6-metre height in the bus terminus for about 1,200 square metres, where 170 four-wheelers and 1,200 bikes could be parked.\n\nSince the parking bay coming up on the first floor would be connected by a concrete slope, the public would be able to park their vehicles easily.\n\n\u201cThe proposed parking facility, to be created at a cost of Rs. 25 crore, may generate an additional revenue of up to Rs. 30 lakh through parking fee,\u201d Dr. Karunakaran said.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) Rajan and Commissioner of Tirunelveli Corporation S. Sivasubramanian participated in the meeting.",
