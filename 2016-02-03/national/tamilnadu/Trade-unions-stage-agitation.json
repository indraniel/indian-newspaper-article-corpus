    "text": "Members of leading trade unions in Tirupur knitwear cluster staged an agitation on Tuesday alleging that the textile associations were unnecessarily delaying the signing of new wage pact for knitwear sector workers.\n\nThe earlier four-year wage agreement signed between the labour unions like CITU, AITUC, INTUC, ATP, HMS, BMS, MLF and LPF had come to an end on January 30 this year.\n\nHowever, the talks to finalise the terms and conditions for the new wage pact began only during the last minute which already had invited the criticisms from the trade unionists and workers.\n\nIn this scenario, the trade unionists staged the protest in front of the Tirupur Exporters Association office on the day.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the textile associations to give increase from the minimum wages scales fixed by the State Government for the garment sector not from the scales fixed in the previous wages pact signed for the workers in Tirupur cluster.\n\nSimilarly, we can not accept the associations\u2019 proposal for an increase of 19 per cent on the wages over a period of four years. We wanted a 100 per cent rise considering the output given by the workers and also the escalation in cost of living\u201d, said M. Chandran, state secretary of CITU.",
