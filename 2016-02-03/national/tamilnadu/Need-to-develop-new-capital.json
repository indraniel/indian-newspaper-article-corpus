Besides, the city had become heavily congested given the population growth leading to problems on various fronts such as traffic, health and sanitation. The concentration of government offices in Chennai has caused difficulties in accessibility for people of far off districts. It was essential to have the Secretariat at a central location of the state to help equitable industrial and economic development, they contended.\n\nIt was high time that a new capital was developed on the lines of Amaravathi that is being developed in Andhra Pradesh, Mr.Arumugam said and suggested that the new capital be located in a place, which is not prone to natural disasters, along the Chennai-Kanyakumari national highway.\n\nIt is essential\n\nto have the Secretariat at\n\na central location\n\nof the state",
