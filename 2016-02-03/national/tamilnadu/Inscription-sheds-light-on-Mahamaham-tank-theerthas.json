Probably this is the first inscription giving plans of a temple tank,\u201d historian Kudavayil Balasubramanian told The Hindu.\n\nHe said the Brahma Theertheswara temple is one of the sixteen temples built by Raghunatha Nayakkar under the guidance of Maha Pradani Govinda Dikshithar in the 17{+t}{+h}century. He had also renovated the steps on all sides of the temple leading to \u2018theerthas\u2019 .\n\n\u201cThe \u2018theerthas\u2019 listed in numerical order in the inscription will help the devotees find their exact location,\u201d he says. According to the inscription, ghats leading to the tank have been identified as various \u2018theerthas\u2019 and they are similar to the ghats in the Ganga river at Kasi.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the tank would be full during Mahamaham. But in the early 1900s, wells symbolising various \u2018theerthas\u2019 were dug and the water level in the tank was kept very low to prevent drowning of devotees,\u201d said Mr Balasubramanian.\n\nRaghunatha Nayakkar also built the sixteen Dhana Mantapas in front of the shrines.\n\nThe inscription has it that it was composed by Guru Rajacharya of Kumbakonam, who was the brother of Guru Ragavendra of Brindhavan.",
