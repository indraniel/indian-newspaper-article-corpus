    "text": "Over 5,000 power looms in Komarapalayam areas are involved in manufacturing of towels\n\nStating that textile companies have reduced the wages for manufacturing towels, power loom owners began their indefinite strike in Komarapalayam here on Monday evening.\n\nThere are over 5,000 power looms functioning in Komarapalayam areas producing towels for the textile companies in bulk quantities.\n\nThe towels manufactured here are sold in showrooms and also exported. These companies pay Rs. 45 as wages to the power loom owners for manufacturing four towels.\n\nHowever, recently, without prior announcement, these companies reduced the wages to Rs. 35 for manufacturing four towels. The cost of manufacturing the towels has gone up as we need to pay more for electricity, rent and wages to workers. Instead of increasing the wages, the companies have reduced Rs. 10 for four towels. \u201cThis forces us to operate under huge losses,\u201d the power loom owners said.\n\nThey said that over 35,000 workers are directly involved in the production activities and are affected by the sudden reduction in wages. They wanted the companies to increase the wages by Rs. 10 so that they could continue to run the units.\n\n\u201cOur indefinite strike will continue until our demands are met,\u201d they said.\n\nThe textile companies have reduced the wages for manufacturing towels",
