    "text": "Residents of seven villages in Arakkonam staged a hunger protest on Tuesday demanding that their villages be added to the newly created Nemili taluk.\n\nThe State government had recently announced the bifurcation of Arakkonam taluk by forming Nemili taluk. Residents of seven villages \u2013 Sayanapuram, Keezhvenkatapuram, Asanellikuppam, Nelvoyal, Thirumalpur, Keezhvenbakkam and Jagirthandalam - who had to travel for 17 kilometres to Arakkonam taluk heaved a sigh of relief as Nemili was closer home. In fact, Nemili was part of their panchayat.\n\n\"However, revenue officials told us we will continue to remain as part of Arakkonam taluk as the villages came under Palur firka, and bifurcation was on the basis of firkas,\" said A.K. Karthikeyan, a resident of Asanellikuppam panchayat.\n\nIn fact, the residents said that Nemili police station was located in Asanellikuppam panchayat. They had submitted petitions to the tahsildar, revenue divisional officer and district revenue officer (DRO) to add the seven villages to Nemili taluk.\n\n\u201cWe opposed to being part of Arakkonam taluk and decided not to allow opening of Nemili taluk if our demand is not met. The DRO had convened a peace committee meeting two months ago and assured to add our villages to Nemili taluk. But now it seems that we will have to remain in Arakkonam taluk. Hence, we observed fast to put forward our demand,\u201d he added.",
