    "text": "With the growing population in Puducherry, the demand for water is increasing. By 2030, the demand is expected to increase by 50 per cent.\n\nChief Minister N. Rangasamy on Tuesday stressed on the importance of conserving groundwater in Puducherry. \u201cWe are completely dependent on groundwater. However, the level of groundwater would deplete the more we extract. This is dangerous to the environment and to our health. Hence it is important to conserve water resources in Puducherry,\u201d he said.\n\nInaugurating the Water Festival 2016 in Puducherry on Tuesday, he said that clean water is essential for our survival. \u201cThe industries are polluting our groundwater. The best example is Mettupalayam, where industries have completely polluted groundwater. This is the reason why I have not permitted supply of water to any chemical industries,\u201d he said.\n\nMLA K. Lakshmi Narayanan said that the big challenge for the whole of Puducherry would be how it is going to cater to the growing needs of people. Another threat to clean water is the solid waste management and sewage due to increase in population. \u201cThere were many lakes in Puducherry but slowly it is getting extinct. How are we going to preserve these water bodies? Till we value the water resource and consider it precious, the problems will continue. It is only in Puducherry that each person is supplied with 200 to 300 litres of drinking water. Hence, it is time we start conserving this valuable resource,\u201d he said.\n\nSuresh C. Tyagi, deputy inspector general, Commander Coast Guard (Puducherry), emphasised on conservation of marine life.\n\nHe said that it was important to know what type of fishing net should be used so that there was no threat to endangered species.\n\nCounsel General of France in Puducherry Philippe Janvier-Kamiyama called for development and preservation of eco system.",
