Natarajan here on Monday, the guest lecturers, including women, said that they had been drawing a fixed monthly salary of Rs. 10,000 for several years and their demand for regularisation had not been fulfilled by the governments headed by the DMK and the AIADMK.\n\n\u201cConcede our long-pending demand or subject us to mercy killing\u201d the lecturers said in the signed petition. About 200 lecturers in the district, including 38 in Sethupathy Government Arts College, had been working as guest lecturers for several years, S. Ramamurthy and T. Magendira Kumar, guest lecturers, at the college, said.\n\nLectures appointed in 2004 on a monthly salary of Rs. 4,000, those appointed in 2009 on a salary Rs. 6,000 and the lecturers who got appointed in 2011 on a salary of Rs. 10,000 had been drawing a salary of Rs. 10,000 for the past five years, and they faced a bleak future.\n\nTheir counterparts in Odisha, Kerala and Karanataka got their services confirmed long back, and drew salaries under the University Grants Commission (UGC) pay scales, they said. \u201cThe Tamil Nadu government, however, employed us as bonded labourers,\u201d they lamented.\n\nThe lecturers offered to surrender their voters\u2019 identity cards but the Collector persuaded them not to surrender the cards and assured them that he would take up the matter with higher authorities, they said.",
