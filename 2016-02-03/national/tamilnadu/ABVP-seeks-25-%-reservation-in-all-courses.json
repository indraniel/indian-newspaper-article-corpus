    "text": "The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has urged the Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu to prevail upon the Ministry of Human Resources Development to direct Pondicherry University to provide 25 per cent reservation for all courses.\n\nIn a memorandum to Mr. Naidu, M. Siva, Vice-president of ABVP Tamil Nadu pointed out that the University extends reservation of 25 per cent for around 20 of the total 56 courses offered.\n\nThis inconsistency in reservation policy limits the scope of students who are not getting opportunities to study these courses and improve their prospects of employment.\n\nHe said that a committee constituted to decide on reservation submitted its recommendation to the academic council in May 2013 but the university had not taken any decision on the issue.\n\nThe Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and National Institute of Technology in Karaikal extends 30 and 50 per cent reservation respectively for students from Puducherry.\n\nThe Pondicherry Central University should also fulfil its assurance and provide 25 per cent reservation in all courses in the next academic year, he said.",
