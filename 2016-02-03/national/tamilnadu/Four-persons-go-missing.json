Zarina (31), who was living in her father\u2019s house at Poolaankudiyirupu near Puliyarai since her husband Syed Ali was working in Chennai, and her niece Parveen Nisha (19), who went to the tailoring class as usual on January 6, did not return home. After their search for the duo in the relatives\u2019 houses in various places went in vain, Zarina\u2019s father Mohideen Pitchai filed a complaint with the Puliyarai police on Monday night.\n\nSimilarly, Sebastian (32), a cable television operator from Srinivasapuram under Ervadi police station limits and Maideen Pitchai (47), a balloon vendor from Pallakkaal Pothukkudi also went missing since January 21 and January 23 respectively.\n\nBased on the complaints from their family members, the Ervadi and Paappaakudi police have registered cases.",
