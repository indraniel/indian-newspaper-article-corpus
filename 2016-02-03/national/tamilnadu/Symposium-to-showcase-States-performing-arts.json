    "text": "Dakshinchitra is organising a four-day symposium titled \u2018Utsavam\u2019 from February 13-16, which will feature performances and presentations based on Tamil Nadu\u2019s performing arts, both in the classical and folk genres.\n\nGeeta Vasudevan, festival director of Utsavam, said when the idea of having a festival was mooted, she thought about an event that would enable people to appreciate the performing arts of Tamil Nadu better. \u201cFor instance, when we go to a carnatic music concert, not all of us know which raga is being sung. We often see rasikas furiously looking for it in some book. This festival is not to help them identify ragas or anything, but to enable them to just appreciate the arts,\u201d she added.\n\nUma Ganesan, the creative director of the event, said interactive sessions between participants and artists would be the highlight of the festival.\n\n\u201cFrom S. Sowmya and Shanta to V.P. Dhananjayan and P.C. Ramakrishna, we have a host of eminent personalities coming for the four-day event. People can interact with them and pose questions,\u201d she added. There would be presentations, performances, therukoothu and even temple procession of dancers and musicians, she said.\n\nFor details, call 45511508/24462435",
