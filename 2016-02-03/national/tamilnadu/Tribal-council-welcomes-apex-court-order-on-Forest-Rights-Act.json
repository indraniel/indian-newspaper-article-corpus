The Ministry of Tribal Affairs filed a petition in the apex court and the three- judge bench on Monday said there is no need for an order to restrict its operation in only one State.\n\nWelcoming the order, council\u2019s chairman K.A. Gunasekaran said that for the past nine years tribals were denied to their legitimate rights without any fault of them. \u201cNow, at last, all the impediments towards the implementation of this Act are over, there may not be any excuse at the part of the administration.\n\nHowever, he said that lot is to be done before implementing the same.\n\nThe age-old monitoring committee under the chairperson of the Chief Secretary, which had been constituted in a haphazard manner, is to be rejuvenated for its speedy implementation, the District level FRA committee under the chairperson of the District Collector is to be constituted and a sub divisional committee with Revenue Divisional Officer as its chairperson to be constituted.\n\nMr. Gunasekaran said that after forming these three committees, FRA committee at the hamlet level need to be formed with maximum of 15 members of which one-third should be women. \u201cThe claim of the beneficiaries should be scrutinised and recommended by the grama sabha to the sub-divisional committee\u201d, he added. \u201cForest officials should co-operate with Revenue and Tribal Welfare Department officials for the speedy implementation of the FRA\u201d, he added.",
