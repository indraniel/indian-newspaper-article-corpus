We were bursting crackers and dancing,\u201d said Jaya, general manager, Sahodaran.\n\nL. Ramakrishnan of SAATHI, an NGO working for health and human rights, said: \u201cThis is the best outcome we could have hoped for. It is good news for us and now, whether the section is repealed or read down to ensure consensual sex between adults is not criminalised, either way, it is a positive step,\u201d he said.\n\nC. Moulee, a volunteer with Orinam.net, an LGBT online collective, said this step gave the community hope that attitudes were changing. \u201cIt re-affirms the country\u2019s constitutional values,\u201d he said.\n\nG. Sankari, an LGBT activist with Nirangal, an organisation that works for LGBTQ rights, said, \u201cThe 2014 judgment on transgenders, even though it was ostensibly only about transgender rights, made a very strong point citing international human rights law that sexual orientation and gender identity must be protected and that discrimination against both is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weight of this and the current decision together augur well for the community,\u201d she added.\n\nActivists say the step gave the community hope that attitudes\n\nare changing",
