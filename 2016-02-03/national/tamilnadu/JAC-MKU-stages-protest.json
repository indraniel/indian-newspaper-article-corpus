Ramakrishnan and V. Venkatraman \u2014 left the university premises without hearing the demands of protesters, the members gheraoed the Registrar\u2019s office following which the CC members came back to negotiate.\n\nThe key demands included revocation of punitive action taken against faculty members V. Vasu, S. Ravikumar and M. Parthasarathy during the tenure of former Vice-Chancellor Kalyani Mathivanan. JAC-MKU also demanded cancellation of the dismissal of two students.\n\nOther demands included the time-bound routine promotions of administrative staff without delay, sanction of Academic Grade Pay to Assistant Professors, constitution of an internal inquiry committee to go into the guest house fire accident that took place in December 2015.
