The shore temple at Mamallapuram is one such site and tourists who touch the centuries-old structure and stain the sculptures with sweat,\u201d K. Lourdusamy, Superintending Archaeologist of ASI said.\n\nAt present, tourists are allowed to go near the temple, which is also one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\u201cThey go near these monuments intending to take selfies. It is very difficult for our field workers to keep an eye over all the tourists. If we allow the tourists entry only around the structure and not inside the temple, it would help,\u201d he said. Though this has been an issue for ASI officials in other old sites too, such as the Big Temple at Thanjavur, the shore temple at Mamallapuram needs more protection, as the monument built in the 8th century AD, is located close to the sea, facing strong winds with salt content.\n\n\u201cWe are also thinking whether we should cover the structure during the nights to reduce the impact of winds for at least 10 to 12 hours,\u201d he said.",
