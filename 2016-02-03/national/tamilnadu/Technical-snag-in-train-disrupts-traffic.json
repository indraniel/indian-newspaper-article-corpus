    "text": "Rail traffic was affected on Arakkonam-Chennai section after the Nilagiri (Blue Mountain) Express was stopped at the Arakkonam station for four hours owing to a technical snag.\n\nAccording to sources, smoke began emanating from the wheels of one of the coaches (S9) as the train plying from Chennai Central to Mettupalayam made its way into platform 1 of Arakkonam station at around 10.20 p.m. on Monday. The train was stopped immediately and staff rushed to rectify the snag. They found that brake binding caused the snag and decided to separate S9 coach.\n\nThe coach was separated, and the passengers were moved to vacant berths in the other coaches. Nearly 60 passengers, who had reservations, had not turned up, and these vacant berths were allotted to the passengers who were travelling in S9 coach.\n\nThe train left the station at about 2.20 a.m. Owing to this, four to five trains were delayed on this route as they were stopped at various locations.",
