This will increase the ease of doing business and facilitate job creation, without compromising on genuine protections and rights available for workers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are progressing on the reforms path by building consensus on these reforms through extensive stakeholder consultations with employers, workers\u2019 representatives and State governments,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Union government launched the second generation reform agenda ESIC 2.0 last year. \u201cMy government is dedicated to the welfare of our brothers and sisters who are our Rashtra Nirmatas ,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ESI scheme has been extended to Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur, Andaman and Nicobar islands. It is proposed to expand the coverage from industries and commercial establishments within a district to entire districts by March 31, 2016.\n\nSo far, 23 colleges across India have received the approval to increase the number of MBBS seats by over 1,700. This includes four State Government medical colleges in Tamil Nadu \u2013 at Coimbatore, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Madurai - that have received approval to upgrade by adding 345 more seats.\n\nThe government is also keen on establishing AIIMS-like institutes across the country and has approved one for Tamil Nadu.\n\n\u2018No real issue\u2019\n\nLater, speaking at a rally, Mr. Modi said the Opposition had no real issues to target him and have resorted to stalling the Rajya Sabha to block passage of crucial Bills.\n\n\u201cWe work hard and pass the laws in the Lok Sabha. But in the Rajya Sabha, they says let\u2019s see what we could do to him and are blocking every thing. Is this good politics? They are hurting the people in trying to teach me a lesson,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\nOn the economic front, he said there was an overwhelming global consensus that among the larger economies, India was the fastest growing.'FDI inflow gone up'\n\n\u201cUnder our government, FDI inflow has gone up by 39 per cent,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThe Prime Minister also dwelt extensively on the welfare measures initiated by the Centre, including the new crop insurance scheme, the launch of \u2018Make in India\u2019 and \u2018Start Up India\u2019 and administrative reforms.",
