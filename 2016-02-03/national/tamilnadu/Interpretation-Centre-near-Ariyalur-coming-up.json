It would provide sound and light effect of the chirpings of the birds which flock towards the sanctuary.\n\nArt works on the birds prominently and regularly visiting the sanctuary would be displayed, according to official sources.\n\nThe major birds which arrive at the sanctuary are Grey Heron, Open Bill Stork, Grey Pelican, Red walted capwing, Little Grebe so on and so forth.\n\nTo attract the visitors, particularly children, an artificial falls with a height of 10 feet, a children\u2019s park, walker\u2019s path and toilet blocks for men and women have been constructed.
