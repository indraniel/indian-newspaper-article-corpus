Parija launched SFACTS, a fund based software, developed by Sthira IT Solutions. The software has been implemented in some of the premier research and academic institutes in India.\n\nJipmer, which has numerous research projects both extramural (funded by external agencies both domestic and foreign) and intramural (funded by the institute), is increasing its focus on research after the creation of a new research division under an initiative of Dr. Parija.\n\nIn fact, there is a substantial increase in focus on research and for the current financial year 2015\u20132016 extramural grants to the tune of Rs. 4 crore and intramural grants to the tune of Rs. 2.5 crore have been received by the institute.\n\nBesides streamlining research, the software is also expected to contribute to the efficient and productive utilisation of the manpower in the field of research and to the customised report generation for statistical purposes.\n\nThe software has been formulated based on Government of India guidelines and rules with respect to research related financial activities in line with accounting standard governed by ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India). A robust internal control system involving all stakeholders in a closed loop system is an added feature.",
