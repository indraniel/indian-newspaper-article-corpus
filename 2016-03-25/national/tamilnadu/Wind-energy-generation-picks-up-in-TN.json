    "text": "Wind energy producers in Tamil Nadu, which has more than 7,500 MW of installed wind energy capacity, were in for a pleasant surprise on Tuesday. Wind energy generation in the State was over1,000 MW on Tuesday evening.\n\nWind direction\n\nOne of the wind energy producers here said the generation in March is usually about 400 MW. This year the change in wind direction now indicates that the south-west winds have set in early in the State.\n\nConsumption of wind energy on Tuesday was 16 million units (constituting five per cent of the total energy consumed).\n\n\u201cThe south-west winds have started and wind energy generation picked up on Tuesday. Further, there is no grid drop for the last two weeks and hence, the entire wind energy produced is consumed,\u201d the producer said.\n\nForecast\n\nMeters have been installed at all the wind energy pooling sub-stations in the State and since last August, the producers are giving a forecast to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) on the energy generation expected.\n\nThe State has 11,800 wind turbines and 110 wind energy pooling sub-stations.\n\nAll these have been covered for the forecast system.\n\nFor the last two days, the producers are also giving a schedule for the wind energy generation expected for the next 10 days.\n\n\u201cIt is 95 per cent accurate. We are giving the schedule in 96 slots (for every 15 minutes) and this is a major step that will help plan energy consumption,\u201d the producer said.",
