    "text": "Scores of Christians thronged churches in various parts of the district and took part in special prayer services on Maundy Thursday, which commemorates the institution of the Holy Eucharist by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper before his Crucifixion. Jesus Christ washed and kissed the feet of his disciples during the Last Supper as an act of humility. To commemorate this act, priests washed and kissed the feet of 12 persons, representing the disciples of the Christ. At Sacred Heart Cathedral here, Bishop of Thoothukudi Roman Catholic Diocese, Rev. Fr. Yvon Ambroise led the prayer service and executed the feet-washing ritual. At Our Lady of Snows Shrine Basilica, Fr. Lerin Derose, Rector and Parish Priest, led the service and washed the feet of 12 senior parishioners. After this ritual service, Corpus Christi was kept in a specially decked altar for adoration.",
