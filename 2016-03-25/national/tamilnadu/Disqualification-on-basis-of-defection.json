    "text": "The 52nd amendment to the Constitution added in the Tenth Schedule lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection. If a member of a political party, who gets elected to a State Legislature, voluntarily relinquishes his membership or votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to any direction of such party, then he would be disqualified on the ground of defection.\n\nThe question as to whether a member of House of State Legislature has become subject to disqualification will be determined by the Speaker.\n\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business Puducherry Legislative Assembly say a member wishing to resign his seat shall do so in the form prescribed.\n\nThe Speaker shall, on receipt of the letter of resignation, if he is satisfied about the genuineness and voluntary nature thereof, inform the House that such a member has resigned the seat in the House.\n\nIf the House is not in session, the Speaker shall inform the House immediately after it resembles.\n\nThe Secretary shall, soon after receipt of resignation by the Speaker, cause the said fact of resignation published in the gazette and forward a copy of the notification to the Election Commission for taking steps to fill the vacancy.",
