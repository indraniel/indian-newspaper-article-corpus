SRINATH\n\nA large number of devotees offered worship to Namperumal on the occasion of Panguni car festival on Thursday.\n\nThe idol of Namperumal was brought to the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Thayar early in the morning. Amidst religious fervour, devotees pulled the car with chants glorifying Sri Ranganathar. They pulled the car through the Chithrai streets, before bringing it to rest.\n\nThe festival commenced with the hoisting of holy flag last week and the car festival marks the ninth day celebrations. This is one of the important annual car festivals celebrated at the temple, coinciding with the Panguni Uthiram. Tight security was in place for the festival.",
