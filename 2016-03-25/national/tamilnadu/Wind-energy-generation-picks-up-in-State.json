And the season for wind power begins usually in May ahead of southwest monsoon and lasts till September. Tamil Nadu has more than 7,500 MW of installed wind energy capacity.\n\nConsumption of wind energy on Tuesday was 16 million units (constituting five per cent of the total energy consumed). Meters have been installed at all the wind energy pooling sub-stations across the State.\n\nSince last August, the producers have been giving a forecast to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) on the energy generation expected.",
