    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday granted relief to R.S. Murugan, a loyalist of Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, by directing a judicial magistrate in Tirunelveli to dispose of a bail application to be filed by him right on the day of his proposed surrender in a case booked under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Justice P.N. Prakash also gave liberty to the complainant, Kumarasamy, in the case to file a petition before the lower court and raise objections to grant of bail to the accused.\n\nHe directed the magistrate to pass orders purely on merits without being prejudiced by any observations made by the High Court.\n\nThe judge passed similar orders with respect to V. Kumar, a co-accused in the case.",
