Siva Saravanan\n\nEfforts are on to install more than 200 high quality internet protocol cameras at the 52 traffic signals, and 11 other junctions in the city this month itself.\n\nIt is as part of the efforts of the police to bring the traffic signals in the city under a single surveillance platform at the police control room.\n\nAbout e 184 cameras C were installed at traffic signals during the World Classical Tamil Conference held here in 2010. They have become defunct due to various reasons over the years.\n\n\u201cThe contractors have been asked to install high quality cameras as specified by the police. Failing to meet the specification will result in cancellation of the contract,\u201d said R. Sivakumar, Deputy Commissioner (Traffic).\n\nAt a meeting with traffic police officers, representatives of a leading telecom operator and licensee who have to maintain the signals chaired by the Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday, it was decided that the places where cameras have to be fixed would be decided after a survey on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to complete the installation before March 28,\u201d Mr. Sivakumar said. According to him three to five cameras (priced around Rs. 30,000 each) will be fixed at every traffic signal for 360 degree surveillance. Some places will have rotating cameras, which costs around Rs. 1.25 lakh a piece.\n\nThe centralised feed of all the signals will be connected to a modern control room using a dedicated cable. These cameras will have back-up for 15 days.\n\nThe control room on the premises of the city police commissioner\u2019s office is expected to be ready by mid April.",
