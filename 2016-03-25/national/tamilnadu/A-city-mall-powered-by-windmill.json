    "text": "Citi Centre, located in Mylapore, makes a powerful demonstration of promoting green energy.\n\nThe 4-lakh square feet mall, which has completed 10 years, meets its energy requirements through a windmill farm.\n\nA spokesperson of the mall said three windmill generators, having a total capacity of 4.5 MW, that have been installed in Tirunelveli meet the electricity needs of the mall. The windmill farm set up in 2009 helps generate more than 50 per cent of the electricity consumed at the mall.\n\nA Tangedco official said the accounting system in cases where a company is located at one place and the windmill at another, involves deducting the energy consumed from the energy injected into the electricity grid and the remaining amount of energy units would have to be paid for by the consumer.",
