This would have fulfilled three years\u2019 of drinking water demand if we had adequate, well-maintained lakes. Waterbodies fall easy prey to sand mining and encroachments,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Forum is now campaigning on the need to conserve waterbodies and the right to free drinking water. Creation of percolation ponds or farm ponds would also help in storing water that otherwise gets into the sea, note experts.\n\nAccording to P. M. Natarajan, former director-Centre for Climate Change, Periyar Maniammai University, Thanjavur, last year\u2019s torrential rains led to floods to the tune of 75 tmcft in three months and hardly 20-25 tmcft was harnessed in the city water bodies.\n\n\u201cIt may be difficult to create new resources now. The government must support creation of percolation ponds or farm ponds to recharge groundwater in urban areas and provide sustainable livelihood to farmers in other districts,\u201d he said.\n\nCreation of percolation ponds or farm ponds would also help in storing water that otherwise gets into the sea, note experts",
