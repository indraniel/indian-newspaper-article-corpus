In a bid to raise awareness of the ill-effects of TB, a seminar was organised at St. Joseph\u2019s Higher Secondary School in Kovilpatti by Barathiyar Memorial Trust.\n\nWhile addressing the students, G. Ramamurthy, doctor attached to Kovilpatti urban health centre, said that TB was a contagious disease, which could be cured, if diagnosed earlier. People should not spit at public places and cover their mouth while coughing to prevent spread of TB.\n\nStudents should create awareness of the impact of TB, he said.\n\nHandbooks containing information on TB symptoms and preventive steps were given to the participants.\n\nM. Alexshan, Headmistress, presided over the programme. Earlier, P. Muthumurugan, founder of the trust, welcomed the gathering.\n\nAccording to a statement from Collector M.
