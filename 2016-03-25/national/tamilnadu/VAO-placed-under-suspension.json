    "text": "A Village Administrative Officer was suspended for overlooking illegal sales of Tasmac liquor in a bar here at Marudandapalli near Shoolagiri. The action was initiated by Hosur Sub Collector Senthil Raju after a surprise raid by a team led by him.\n\nThe officials were tipped-off on the operation of the bar without permit near a Tasmac outlet at Marudandapalli. In addition, it was also found that the bar that was open round-the-clock sold Tasmac liquor illegally.\n\nThe bar was raided at 7 a.m. on Thursday. However, the owners of the bar had absconded. The VAO of Marudandapalli, Krishnan, was suspended for not alerting the officials of the illegal operation of the bar. Action is also likely to be initiated against the salesmen of the Tasmac outlet.",
