    "text": "A campaign on protecting water bodies was organised under the auspices of Eco Youth - Pudukottai, a service organisation, at Munasandhai near here on Wednesday. Students and volunteers from the village cleaned a local tank of rags and plastic waste to protect the water body and conserve the groundwater table.\n\nThe Managing Director of Rose Trust, A. Adhappan, who inaugurated the campaign, said the tank in Sri Veeramakali Amman temple, has been a major source for harvesting rainwater. But, it was being used as a dumping yard for garbage and other waste materials. He urged the government to permit farmers to clear the silt deposited in these tanks for agricultural use. \u201cIt would go a long way in deepening the water bodies and augmenting the texture of farm soil and, thereby, agricultural productivity,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the volunteers of the Eco Youth \u2013 Pudukottai, took out a procession in the village and raised slogans appealing to the local villagers to protect and conserve the water bodies.",
