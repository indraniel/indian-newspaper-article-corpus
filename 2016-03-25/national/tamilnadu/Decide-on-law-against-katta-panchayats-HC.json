    "text": "The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to submit its final view on introducing a proper legislation to curb \u2018katta panchayats\u2019 (kangaroo courts) in the State.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh made the direction on a suo motu proceeding and a PIL moved by K. Gopal to check the menace of \u2018katta panchayats\u2019.\n\nWhen the pleas came up for hearing, the authorities submitted that they would need four more months to proceed with the discussions in view of the coming Assembly election. Refusing to accept the contention, the Bench said, \u201cThe impending elections cannot come in the way of the continuation of the discussions as the matter is very urgent in nature.\u201d\n\nNaturally any legislation would have to await the constitution of the new Assembly, but the ground level work shall continue, the Bench said and directed that a final view be placed by June 23.",
