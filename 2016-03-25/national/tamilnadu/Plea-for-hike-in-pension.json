S. Krishnan, Assistant Secretary of the Association, Thoothukudi District, who led the agitation near BSNL office on WGC road here, said based on the hike in dearness allowance that was merged with basis pay of the employees, pension benefits should also be increased. The enhanced dearness allowance of 78.2 percent with the merged basic pay was effected on June 18 in 2013. So, the authorities should calculate it accordingly and hike the pension, he said.",
