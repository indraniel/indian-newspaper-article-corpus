    "text": "When it comes to tapping resources, the DMK seems to be way ahead of other parties in generating income through various means including donations from individuals with its district secretaries striving hard to contribute to the party\u2019s kitty.\n\nData compiled by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) based on information available in public domain shows that the DMK netted Rs. 158.52 crore as income and donations during a five-year period beginning 2010-11. In comparison, the AIADMK was able to generate Rs.119.24 crore during the same period.\n\nSignificantly, among the top three donors to the DMK during the five years are: former Ministers E.V. Velu and T.M. Anbarasan, who were then also secretaries of the party\u2019s Tiruvannamalai and Kancheepuram district units.\n\nAnother top contributor is Madhavaram S Sudarsanam, who is in charge of the DMK\u2019s Tiruvallur district unit.\n\nIn the DMK, district secretaries consider it a prestige to vie with each other to collect and contribute the highest funds to the party, largely to meet election expenditure. In fact, party president M. Karunanidhi earned the moniker \u2018Mr. Eleven Lakh\u2019 from the DMK founder C.N. Annadurai at the party\u2019s Virugambakkam conference in 1966-67 for collecting Rs.11 lakh.\n\n\u201cI collected and contributed Rs 7.12 crore between 2010-11 and 2014-15 in my capacity as district secretary of the party,\u201d says Mr.Velu, who had a brief stint as a bus conductor and ticket checker. He has since tried his hands at different things including running a printing press, a transport service and producing films and acting. \u201cI introduced film director V. Sekar and acted in a dual role in Thilagam with actress Gowthami in the lead,\u201d says Mr Velu, who is the founder of the Arunai Engineering College in Tiruvannamalai and a former Minister.\n\nMr. Sudarsanam, a former Government Pleader, who is now the secretary of the DMK\u2019s North-Chennai district after it was bifurcated, says his contribution of Rs 7.12 crore, too was made on behalf of the Tiruvallur district unit of which he was then in charge. He had joined the DMK in 1976 as a student wing leader and was the Madhavaram town unit secretary for 11 years before rising to the level of a district secretary.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Anbarasan, who had contributed Rs.6.04 crore on behalf of the party\u2019s Kancheepuram unit, says this time for the forthcoming Assembly election too he has contributed Rs. 4 crore to the party.\n\nHe hails from a family of weavers and was the Labour Minister in the last DMK government.\n\nIncidentally, DMK leader Karunanidhi had honoured the three at the party\u2019s Tiruchi conference two years ago by presenting them gold rings in recognition of their contribution of party funds.",
