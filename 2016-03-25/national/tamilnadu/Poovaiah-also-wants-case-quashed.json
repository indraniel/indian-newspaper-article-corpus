Krishnamoorthy for want of sufficient evidence, his former personal assistant T. Poovaiah (63), an accused, has also moved the Madras High Court Bench here with a plea to quash the case in respect of him too.\n\nJustice V.S. Ravi had quashed the proceedings against the former Minister on March 8 after holding that the entire case had been rested on hearsay evidence and \u201ceven that hearsay evidence was not direct hearsay evidence.\u201d\n\nThe case was booked after the death of Agricultural Engineering Department official S. Muthukumarasamy by jumping before a speeding train in Tirunelveli on February 20 last.\n\nThe CB-CID claimed that the officer had committed suicide since he could not meet a demand reportedly made by the former minister and his aides to pay Rs.1.75 lakh for each of the seven temporary drivers appointed in the department on consolidated pay last year.",
