    "text": "CITU National secretary A. Soundararajan said that the People's Welfare Front (PWF) has now emerged as the \u2018most viable alternative\u2019 to the corrupt AIADMK and DMK regimes.\n\n\u201cOur alliance have come together in a natural way to fight the common elements like eradication of corruption, prohibition, conservation of natural resources, welfare of farm and unorganised workers and prevention of honour killings,\u201d he told reporters here on Thursday.\n\nMr. Soundararajan, who is also the CPI(M) central committee member and an MLA, said that around 80 per cent of people in the State now feel that it was imperative to have some alternative to successive AIADMK and DMK rules in the State for the last four decades because of the high scale of corruption.\n\nCorruption\n\n\u201cCorruption is eating out the efficiency of the delivery systems. Common man is perturbed over the situation and he would end this soon by voting PWF to power,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Soundararajan expressed his concern over the delay in finalising the new slabs of wages for knitwear workers in Tirupur.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that the knitwear unit owners are dragging on the wage talks despite the fact that the previous four-year wage agreement expired in January.\u201d\n\nHe slammed the Union Government\u2019s decision to reduce the interests on small savings like public provident fund and kissan vikas patra as well as setting 58 years limit to get the employer\u2019s contribution of provident fund.\n\n\u201cThese are anti-worker moves by the Union Government. They should have remembered that it was only the 'small savings mentality' that helped us withstand the economic situation arisen due to global meltdown,\u201d he said.",
