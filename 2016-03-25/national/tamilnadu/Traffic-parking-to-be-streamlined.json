Periasamy\n\nTo regulate parking, streamlining of traffic, and decongest roads, the traffic police on Thursday launched \u2018Vaaram Oru Veedhi\u2019 \u2013 One Street One Week \u2013 project.\n\nThe focus will be on one street every week. Steps will be taken to sustain these reforms introduced on Thursdays on these roads on a permanent basis.\n\nIt began on the Government Arts College Road, and Vysial Street.\n\n\u201cThe project has been introduced after a police officer who was recently been transferred to the city from Madurai had seen the successful implementation of a similar programme there,\u201d said R. Sivakumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic).\n\n\u201cThe police will ensure that \u2018no parking,\u2019 \u2018one-way\u2019 are implemented properly, and footpaths are free from encroachments. By the end of the week we will earmark space for parking wherever necessary. We will coordinate with the corporation to repair foot paths, and to clear garbage dumped on them,\u201d Mr. Sivakumar said.\n\n\u201cFifty busy roads in the city have been identified for this project,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner (Traffic) K. Magudapathy.\n\nNext week, the State Bank Road (near the Railway Junction) and the Raja Street will be taken up.",
