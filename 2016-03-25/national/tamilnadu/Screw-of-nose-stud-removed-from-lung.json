An x-ray revealed the presence of a metallic object in the left lung.\n\nMissing\n\nRelatives of the patient informed doctors that they had tried to remove the nose stud in the morning but could get only the stud and the screw was missing.\n\nAs the patient\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate, it was planned to remove the foreign body through Bronchoscopy.\n\nAccording to a press release, lodging of foreign body through aspiration was common among children but in the case of this patient the screw was lodged in the lower part of the left lung and hence difficult to be removed.\n\nHour-long procedure\n\nForceps were inserted through the Bronchoscope and the gold screw was removed after an hour\u2019s procedure.\n\nAfter this, the patient\u2019s breathing became normal. Because of the advanced technique, the patient was saved from further complications and a major thoracic surgery, the statement claimed.",
