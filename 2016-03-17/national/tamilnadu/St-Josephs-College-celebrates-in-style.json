The colourful audience never missed an opportunity to express their joy when its milestones were highlighted by a video presentation with music and dance show.\n\nRev. John Britto, Rector, said the heritage status had become a yet another milestone of the college that had been serving the humanity for several decades. It had added value to the institution.\n\nRev. Andrew, Principal, said it was an honour to the illustrious service of the college, Jesuits, retired and serving teaching and non teaching staff, thousands of alumni and students.",
