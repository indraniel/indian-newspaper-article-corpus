Raghunathan\n\nThe delay in completion of pavements at Mylapore, which was expected to be completed ahead of the Arupathummoovar festival, has become a serious concern for residents and devotees flocking the temple.\n\nThe initial improvement of pavements \u2014 being carried out as part of Mylapore heritage walk project \u2014 is under progress in South and East Mada streets.\n\nBut the work being carried out in the middle of the annual Arupathummoovar festival, visited every year by thousands of devotees, is a major hassle for pedestrians. Traders on South Mada Street complained that the work that was expected to over by February is still incomplete.\n\nWhile residents of the locality point out that pavement improvement works were a welcome measure, they also feared that usable space on the already narrow road would reduce and add to traffic problems.\n\nP. Hariharan, a trader on South Mada Street, said the existing platform was demolished a fortnight ago, forcing hawkers to move onto the road.\n\nChennai Corporation officials said they had speeded up the work and also dispelled fears of a section of residents that as the pavement improvement work had started even before the model code of conduct came into force in connection with the State Assembly elections.\n\n(Additional reporting\n\nby R.
