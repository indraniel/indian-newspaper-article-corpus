So, we decided to address this need through our partnership venture,\u201d said Vasudha Prakash, Founder Trustee of V Excel, an NGO that works for child welfare.\n\nTrainees will engage and be trained in laundry and dry cleaning which includes collection, washing, ironing, checking, packing and delivery.\n\nThe initiative can also be partnered by other people from the city.\n\n\u201cThis will help them in developing their skills,\u201d she said.",
