The temperature in Dindigul came down by evening.\n\nThe rain will be very useful for long-term, perennial, annual and horticulture crops in Dindigul district.\n\nBut the rain would hamper harvesting of second crop in the double cropping area spread across Palanichettipatti and Gudalur in the Cumbum valley in Theni district.",
