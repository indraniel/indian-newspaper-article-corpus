Senthamarai (46), who alleged that the SSI and his wife had cheated him to the tune of Rs. 40 lakh.\n\nThe complainant said that the SSI and his wife had collected money during 2011-12 for offering consolidated chit funds of Rs. 5 lakh, Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 20 lakh and failed to honour the complainant after he paid the monthly contributions.\n\nThe complainant also alleged that he had pledged his house as collateral security after he had borrowed money from the SSI but failed to return the property even after he cleared the debts. As the local police failed to register a case, he had moved the court, he added.",
