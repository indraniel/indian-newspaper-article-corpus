The annual savings is expected to be an estimated Rs. 3.45 lakh every year at each station. \u201cThe initial cost is high, but the payback period for return on investment is 21 months,\u201d officials said.\n\nAt Chennai Central and Egmore, the administration is replacing conventional bulbs and tube lights with LED lamps on a large scale and this effort includes the new signage boards. In terms of illumination, passengers are unable to tell the difference between LED lamps and conventional tube lights and bulbs, but they appreciate the power- and money-saving from former. \u201cMoney thus saved should be re-invested to improve passenger amenities,\u201d said B. Rangan, who was waiting at the concourse at Central station to board a train to Coimbatore.\n\nOfficials said that they would soon be installing nearly 5,000 LED lamps at stations and office buildings all over Chennai Division and the projected savings in power was estimated to be over 3 lakh units and a sum of Rs. 32.4 lakh a year. The railway administration had also installed solar-powered lights in Tambaram and Chengalpattu and water heaters and pumps elsewhere.",
