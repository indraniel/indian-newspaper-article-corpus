    "text": "The elections department will commission one all-woman polling station in each of the nine Assembly constituencies in Cuddalore district for the forthcoming polls on May 16.\n\nReturning officers have been asked to identify the polling stations. All the presiding officers, polling officers, micro-observers and police personnel would be women at the all-woman polling stations, Collector S. Suresh Kumar has said.\n\nThe elections department will intensify its systematic voters\u2019 education and electoral participation (SVEEP) initiative in polling stations with a past record of low turnout during the polls. Mr. Kumar said the elections department had notified 2,256 polling booths in the district. Cuddalore district had around 119 vulnerable and critical booths.\n\nThe authorities will provide inputs on vulnerable and critical booths to the election observers and the list would be finalised based on untoward incidents that had been reported during the last elections.\n\nThe department has also introduced single-window system to facilitate political parties, candidates and others seeking clearances from various departments and agencies for holding election rallies, arranging public campaign meetings and making transport arrangements.\n\nAround 52 cases have been registered so far for violation of the Model Code. The control room has received 22 complaints and all have been disposed, Mr. Kumar added.",
