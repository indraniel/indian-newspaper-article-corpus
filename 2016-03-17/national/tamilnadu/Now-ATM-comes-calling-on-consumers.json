    "text": "In a new and novel initiative, the State Bank of India (SBI) has introduced a \u201cmobile ATM\u201d which would move around the city on different timings.\n\nLaunching the facility on the zonal office premises on Wednesday, SBI General Manager G. Ravindranath said that in Madurai module there were 750 ATMs, which include 225 in Madurai city and suburban location of the district alone. The Automated Teller Machine, installed in a vehicle, would travel from place to place within the \u2018temple\u2019 city. It would be parked at locations, to suit public needs and at places without an ATM like flower market, bus stand, Government Rajaji Hospital, Meenakshi Mission Hospital, Karuppayoorani Pandi Koil, Nelpettai among others.\n\nIt would also be parked in front of institutions and factories/industries on days/dates like disbursal of salaries/wages which would enable workers/staff to withdraw money instantly on stepping out of the premises. \u201cThe idea is that a consumer need not go in search of the ATM and instead the kiosk would be there at his/her doorsteps,\u201d Mr. Ravindranath said and added that the new initiative was expected to help all types of consumers.\n\nThe SBI was the first to launch such a facility. On an average, the bank\u2019s ATMs situated (offsite) in the city had a swipe rate of minimum 300 per day. Thus, introduction of such a mobile ATM would only come in handy for more users, particularly, the floating population. This was the third in TN and first in southern districts. Madurai module comprised 216 branches spread over eight districts including Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari respectively, officials said.",
