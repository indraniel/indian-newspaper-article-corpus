    "text": "Kidney surgeries were performed on two children below the age of 10, at Global Hospitals recently.\n\nAccording to a press release, Fathima Huda, a four-year-old child weighing 13 kg was born with developmental problems involving her liver and kidney.\n\nShe was medically managed but needed a kidney transplant when her kidney function deteriorated to less than 10 per cent. The surgery was performed at Global, and Fathima\u2019s left kidney, weighing 850 grams was removed, and her mother\u2019s kidney was replaced there.\n\nAnother child, Vedika, six years old and weighing 14 kgs, had a tumour in her right kidney. When she was a one year old, it was removed.\n\nA few years later, Vedika developed glomerulosclerosis, a condition in which the kidney\u2019s blood vessels get scarred.\n\nThis affected the function of her left kidney and, despite treatment, progressed to kidney failure.\n\nHer left kidney too, had to be removed.\n\nVedika was on peritoneal dialysis for eight months, after she received a kidney transplant. Doctors spoke about patient survival on kidney transplants, which is better than those who remain on dialysis.\n\nChallenging task\n\nKidney transplants in children weighing below 15 kg is challenging, the doctors said.\n\nAlso, creating awareness on treatment options available for children with kidney problems is the need of the hour, they added.",
