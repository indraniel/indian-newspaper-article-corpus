    "text": "The AIADMK demanded that the CBI reinvestigate the death of former Union Minister A Raja\u2019s close associate Sadiq Batcha, who committed suicide in 2011 in the midst of the investigation in the 2G scam.\n\nThe party\u2019s demand for the re-probe came after the late Batcha\u2019s relatives published an advertisement in a Tamil magazine on his fifth death anniversary.\n\nThe message in the advertisement read \u2013 \u201cTo repay a loan, you joined forces that you shouldn\u2019t have, and succumbed to treachery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBI should reinvestigate the case. The four lines published in the advertisement is enough evidence to show that Batcha\u2019s family was afraid to say anything as the DMK and Congress were in power at that time. After so many years, the truth has come out. This is proof enough of the DMK\u2019s hand in the 2G spectrum case,\u201d AIADMK spokesperson C R Saraswathy told The Hindu.\n\nIn a television interview on Wednesday, Mr. Batcha\u2019s brother-in-law, Ashik, alleged that the involvement of politicians in Batcha\u2019s real-estate business ruined his prospects.\n\nThe business also got mired in the 2G scam and \u201che was under tremendous pressure,\u201d he alleged.\n\nPoem published\n\nThe AIADMK also seized the opportunity and published a poem in memory of Mr. Batcha in its party mouthpiece \u201cDr. Namadhu M.G.R\u201d and insinuated that Mr. Batcha\u2019s family was blaming the DMK for his death.\n\nMr. Batcha, Managing Director of city-based export firm Green House Promoters, was under the CBI scanner for his suspected links with those involved in the 2G case and committed suicide in March 2011. DMK leaders could not be reached for comment.",
