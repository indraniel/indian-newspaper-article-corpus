    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has appealed to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to allow Rs. 2 lakh to be carried in vehicles without documents.\n\nIn a statement issued here on Wednesday, its president N. Jegatheesan and senior president S. Rethinavelu claimed that that seizure of cash from vehicles by officials had \u201cseverely constrained trade and industrial activities\u201d and the public felt harassed.\n\nThe chamber said that it was inevitable for businessmen to carry substantial amount of cash with them in vehicles from one district to another for buying agricultural produce from farmers and also for payment in bona fide commercial transactions.\n\n\u201cIf such amounts are confiscated in the absence of proper documents, trade and industrial activities would come to a standstill in Tamil Nadu,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement said that it was impracticable for traders to always carry cheques or demand drafts and, invariably, small traders made credit sales and collected the dues from different places in vehicles.\n\nIf their hard earned money was seized, it would create utter panic and discontent among the business community.\n\nPublic also carried money to buy jewellery and textiles during the marriage season and officials refused to take cognizance of wedding invitations while checking vehicles for transportation of cash.\n\nThe chamber appealed to the ECI to immediately allow Rs. two lakh to be transported in vehicles without any documents.",
