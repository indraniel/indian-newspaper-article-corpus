James\n\nAround 30 nursing assistants from Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) staged a protest in front of the hospital\u2019s administrative block on Wednesday morning, alleging harassment by senior nursing staff.\n\nThe protest came against the backdrop of an alleged suicide attempt on Tuesday by a Female Nursing Assistant (FNA), M. Karthika, who had claimed that she was verbally abused at workplace by nursing superintendents.\n\nDuring the protest, the nursing assistants complained that they were made to work for more than the stipulated eight-hour duty time.\n\nOne of the protesters alleged that FNAs had not even been allocated changing rooms.\n\nThe protesters also insisted on registration of a first information report against the nursing superintendents who abused Mr. Karthika. While the police did conduct inquiries with Ms. Karthika on Tuesday, a case has not been registered yet.\n\nPacifying the protesters, GRH Dean M.R. Vairamuthu Raju told them that a committee had been formed to inquire into the harassment allegedly faced by Ms. Karthika.\n\nHe also assured the protesters that their other demands would be immediately looked into, following which the nursing assistants gave up the protest.",
