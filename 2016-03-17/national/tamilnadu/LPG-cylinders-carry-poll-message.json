    "text": "District Collector S. Palanisamy inaugurating the pasting of voter awareness stickers on LPG cylinders to be distributed among households in Nagapattinam on Wednesday.\n\nWith the election authorities trying out various measures to improve the voting percentage in the Assembly election, the district administration here has launched an initiative to reach out to voters through the LPG refill cylinders supplied to households.\n\nDistrict Collector S. Palanisamy inaugurated the initiative here on Wednesday by pasting stickers at a few LPG cylinders and on autorickshaws. The stickers emphasise the need for young voters to enrol their names in the electoral rolls and on the importance of all eligible voters exercising their franchise.\n\nIn a release issued later, Mr. Palanisamy pointed out that steps were being taken by the Election Commission to achieve 100 per cent polling and voters should exercise their right without fail, as a few votes could decide the fate of candidates.\n\nHe administered a pledge to students of Sri Isaac Newton College on the importance of voting.",
