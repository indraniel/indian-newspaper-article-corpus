The monthly expenses of the poor and the middle class would increase. The day-to-day life of the poor would be affected. I urge that the hike in the fuel prices is rolled back immediately,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa said in a statement.\n\nReiterating her stand that the methods being followed by the oil marketing companies while determining fuel prices were wrong, she said it would affect the poor. \u201cHike in prices like these would affect the people, including the middle class, who own two-wheelers.\u201d\n\nPMK founder S. Ramadoss too demanded that the hike in the fuel prices be rolled back. Observing the hike was \u201cunacceptable\u201d, he alleged the action was not in the public interest and was to aid commercial interests.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Ramadoss charged that attitude of the Centre to generate revenue from fuel prices was the reason behind the hike.\n\nIn the interest of the poor and the middle class people, the hike in prices should be rolled back by the government and the oil marketing companies, he added.",
