This is not a regular phenomenon as the last time the demand touched 3,000 MW was in 2013 when the maximum electricity demand recorded was 3,027 MW on May 29.\n\nAccording to data provided by Tangedco, electricity consumption in the city has been growing along with the number of domestic consumers over the past four years, even as demand has remained steady in the range between 2,500 and 3,000 MW in the city between April and July.\n\nThe only exception was 2015 when the consumption slightly decreased.\n\nTangedco officials are confident that several development measures carried out on the transmission front including construction of sub-stations, installation of new transformers and upgradation of electricity cable and pillar boxes would help in preventing low voltage or power cuts in the city.\n\nA senior official said the commissioning of new substations at Guindy, Vyasarpadi, Sholinganallur, KITS Park in Sholinganallur and Manali had resulted in an improvement in stabilised supply.",
