    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has refused to entertain a contempt of court application against University Grants Commission Secretary Jaspal Singh Sandhu, Higher Education Secretary Apoorva, Director of Collegiate Education K. Sekar, Manonmanian Sundaranar University Vice-Chancellor K. Baskar and its Registrar A. John De Britto.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and R. Mahadevan dismissed the application right at the admission stage after observing that another Division Bench had only directed the five officials to consider a representation made by the contempt applicant, S. Jedidiah Sathya, and did not issue a \u201cpositive direction\u201d as sought by him in a writ petition filed in 2013.\n\nDisposing of the petition on September 9 last, the Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and V.M. Velumani had refused to direct the officials to restrain two private colleges in Thoothukudi district from claiming religious minority status besides forbearing them from disbursing educational grant to those institutions.\n\nThe Bench, however, directed them to consider the petitioner\u2019s representation.",
