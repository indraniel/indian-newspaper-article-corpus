    "text": "BJP general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao on Wednesday said it was up to DMDK leader Vijayakant to make an alliance between the two parties work.\n\nAddressing reporters, Mr. Rao said the BJP had not declared a chief ministerial candidate and this issue was not an \u201cimpediment\u201d indicating that the party would be open to accepting Mr. Vijayakant as the leader of the alliance.\n\n\u201cFrom our side, another positive thing is we have not declared we have a chief ministerial candidate. So that is not an impediment. There is no roadblock [for an alliance]. Anything can happen. But the answer could only be given by Mr. Vijayakant,\u201d he stated.\n\nMr. Rao said the aim of the BJP was to unseat the two major Dravidian parties and provide a corruption free government to the people of Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Vijayakant\u2019s declaration that he would go alone may also mean fighting the AIADMK and DMK. \u201cIn this, the two parties are on common ground,\u201d he said.",
