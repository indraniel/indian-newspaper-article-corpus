    "text": "Stone-crushing unit falls into the quarry\n\nA mud slide was reported at a quarry in Erumaiyur village in Kancheepuram district on Wednesday. No one was injured. The incident triggered a scare among the residents around the quarry.\n\nThe mud slide took place early in the morning and, in the impact, a stone-crushing unit was dragged into the quarry, which is about 150-ft deep.\n\nOn being informed, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) personnel from Tambaram and Kundrathur rushed to the spot and launched rescue operations. The quarry walls that developed cracks a week ago were cordoned off.\n\nMoneylender robbed\n\nIn yet another attention-diversion case in the city, a moneylender at Padhuvanchery, near Tambaram, was robbed of his cash on Wednesday.\n\nS. Rooparam (50), who owns a pawn-broking shop on Mudichur Road in west Tambaram, was talking to his friend after parking his motorcycle. A stranger pointed to a few Rs.10 notes on the ground. Even as Rooparam tried to pick them, assuming that the notes belonged to him, the suspect robbed the bag containing Rs. 1.15 lakh placed on the petrol tank cover of his vehicle.",
