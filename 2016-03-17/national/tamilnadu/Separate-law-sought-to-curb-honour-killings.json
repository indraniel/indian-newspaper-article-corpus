But, no law has been enacted so far,\u201d they added.\n\nThe demonstrators said that every couple has every right to live in the society without fear and it is the duty of the State government to provide security to all. \u201cMarriage is by one\u2019s wish and no one can prevent it,\u201d they added. They said that the recent incident of the youth murdered in full public view is barbaric and demanded stringent punishment for the accused. \u201cOnly a separate law with stringent punishment would prevent honour killings,\u201d they added. The members also wanted compensation for the victim\u2019s wife and a government job for her so that she could lead a life.",
