    "text": "A delegation from Mauritius was in the city on Wednesday to visit a few healthcare institutions to facilitate city doctors visit the island nation and offer healthcare services there.\n\nMinister for Health and Quality of Life A.K. Gayan said they had signed several MoUs with leading healthcare institutions in the city.\n\n\u201cOn an average, around 300 patients visit India from Mauritius for treatment every year and we already have been working with hospitals in Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nHowever, we are now trying to get Chennai doctors visit our country and offer their services so that patients can save on travel expenses and will not have to leave their home land during a medical emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gayan said this would help the safety of patients with severe ailments, who do not have to travel by air.\n\nStating that Mauritius lacked experts in advanced neurosurgery, plastic surgery, interventional neurology and scoliosis, he appealed to the doctors and healthcare professionals in the city to consider working in the island country.\n\nS.M. Balaji, Director of Balaji Dental and Craniofacial Hospital, who signed an MoU, said: \u201cApart from performing surgeries, I also hope to train and speak to the doctors there on this area of expertise,\u201d he said.",
