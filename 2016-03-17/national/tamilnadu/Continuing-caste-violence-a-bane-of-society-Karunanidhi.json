    "text": "DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Wednesday regretted that casteism continued to affect the Tamil society despite the efforts taken since the days of Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy.\n\nReacting to the killing of Shankar, a Dalit youth who had married outside his community, in Udumalpet, Mr. Karunanidhi said, \u201cI condemned a similar incident that took place in Dharmapuri in 2012. Now, the State Human Rights Commission has taken up the issue suo motu. Besides taking legal action against those involved in the killing of Shankar, the government should take steps to prevent similar incidents in future,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Karunanidhi also made an appeal to build amity and humanism among all sections of the society.\n\nOn the DK conference in Tiruchi on March 20, he said party treasurer M.K. Stalin would attend the event on his behalf, he added.",
