    "text": "The Congress has criticised the Puducherry Legislative Assembly\u2019s failure to bring out a booklet on who\u2019s who of legislators.\n\nVery informative book\n\nIt serves as a source of information on the legislators. The Speaker of a legislative body is responsible for bringing out the booklet and making it available to the Members of the Assembly at the beginning of the term itself.\n\nIn a statement, V. Pethaperumal, vice-president of Congress party, said all over India, the who\u2019s who of Assembly members of each term is brought out by Assembly Secretariat in the beginning of the term without any delay and copies of the same are made available to the members.\n\nBut, in Puducherry, even at the stage of expiry of the Assembly term, such a booklet was not brought out.\n\n'Poor administration'\n\nThe former Minister who also had also served as MLA for five times said, \u201cThe present situation of the Assembly's inability to bring out the book shows the poor and incapable administration of the Puducherry Assembly secretariat under the leadership of the present Speaker.\n\nThis is a shameful event in the history of Puducherry Assembly since its constitution.\n\n\u201cThe administration in the local bodies and in the government has collapsed. But it is unique that the legislative body faces a similar fate in Puducherry,\u201d Mr. Pethaperumal alleged.",
