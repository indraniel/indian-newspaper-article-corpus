The statue is of 90 cm long and 50 cm high, with eight lines of Tamil script,\u201d said S. Ravikumar, one of the archaeologists of the Veerarajendran Archaeological ad Historical Research Centre here.R. Poongundran, a former Assistant Director of the State Archaeological Department, who deciphered the script on the statue, said the lines indicated that an official who was in charge of the area about 1,000 years back had erected the structure.\n\nThe lines say that the sculpture was set up to thank God for curing some disease in the locality.\n\nThe practice of erecting animal sculpture was prevalent in some villages of Kongunadu, said Mr. Poongundran adding that it was for the first time Tamil script was found on such sculptures.",
