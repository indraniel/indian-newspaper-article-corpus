    "text": "Three CPI (M)-affiliated organisations came together on Wednesday to organise a protest against recent anti-farmer decisions by private banks and financial institutions in the State.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Farmers\u2019 Association, Bank Employees Federation of India and Democratic Youth Federation of India initially planned their protest in front of a branch of Kotak Mahindra Bank on T. Nagar\u2019s Venkatanarayana Road.\n\nThe 60-odd individuals were denied access to the proposed venue by the police and were forced to protest outside the nearby Natesan Park.\n\nKotak Mahindra was chosen because its Thanjavur branch on March 4 tried to recover a farmer\u2019s tractor for defaulting. This led to G. Balan, the farmer, being assaulted by policemen.\n\nHowever, the protesters were keen to point out other instances. \u201cThere has been no FIR against those who assaulted Balan. The men who insulted Alagar were former policemen. The government could have at least cautioned their staff from working for such companies,\u201d said P. Shanmugam, general secretary of TNFA.\n\nAlagar committed suicide on March 11 after representatives of Cholamandalam Finance seized his tractor.\n\nShanmugam also criticised the various tactics of private players. \u201cKotak Mahindra obtained an ex-parte order against Balan. The Inspector slapped him when he demanded to see the order,\u201d he said.\n\nShanmugam pointed out that the response has been disproportionate: Balan had already paid Rs. 4.11 lakhs after borrowing Rs. 3.8 lakh and had only two instalments left; Alagar paid Rs. 5 lakh after borrowing Rs. 7 lakh.",
