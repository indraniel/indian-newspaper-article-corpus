All the seven accused, including O. Raja, brother of Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, were also present.

He said that blood stains were present on the body of his son.\n\nWhen Special Public Prosecutor B. Mohan appealed to Principal District Judge R. Poornima to adjourn the case for a long time, she turned down the request, saying that trial would continue on a daily basis.
