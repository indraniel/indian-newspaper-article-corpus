Free, quality and compulsory education will be provided through e-learning in Tamil Nadu, where no importance was given for providing quality education after the rule of K. Kamaraj,\u201d Dr. Anbumani said.\n\nApart from this, the children would be provided with right ambience for learning English as second compulsory language and Hindi or any other foreign language as third optional language at school level, which would enable them to compete at national and global level.\n\n\u201cIf the PMK is voted to power, we\u2019ll never give you freebies such as television sets and domestic appliances. Instead, we\u2019ll give you free education, healthcare and free farm inputs through corruption-free administration, which will collectively save at least Rs. 1 lakh per family per annum,\u201d he assured.\n\nWhile answering participants\u2019 queries, Dr. Anbumani solicited valuable suggestions from the audience on making the educational system more vibrant.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, he said that the PMK would be the right choice of the voters, especially the young voters.",
