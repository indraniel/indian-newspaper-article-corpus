    "text": "A recent notification by the University Grants Commission to vice chancellors of all universities has confused professors, including administrative authorities.\n\nIn a notification to Vice- Chancellors dated March 1, the UGC said that \u201cthe period of active service spent on pursuing research degree, i.e. for acquiring Ph.D degree simultaneously without taking any kind of leave may be counted as teaching experience for the purpose of direct recruitment/promotion to the post of associate professor and above.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, the notification seems to address an issue involving candidates pursuing Ph.D degree.\n\nBut, the Association of University Teachers members point out that it would not apply to the State as the government had already issued an order, recognising a Ph.D scholar\u2019s effort with several incentives and a few years\u2019 remission in service at the entry level itself.\n\nUGC\u2019s Vice Chairman H. Devaraj said the notification was for those who entered service with NET/SET scores but take extraordinary periods of leave during research.",
