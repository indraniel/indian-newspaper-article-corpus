    "text": "At an age when most would spend retired life, Kovaipudur resident C. Raju chose to be different. He enrolled for an M.Phil. programme at the Government Arts College, Coimbatore, and has now finished it.\n\nHe studied Shashi Deshpande\u2019s novel and wrote the dissertation, \u2018Quest for identity in Shashi Deshpande\u2019s \u2018The Dark Holds no Lessons, That Long Silence and Roots and Shadows.\u2019\n\nSoon after voluntary retirement from the Indian Telephone Industries, he enrolled for an M.A. in the Tamil Nadu Open University. \u201cI wanted to pursue higher education and that too English literature. That is the reason that I pursued B.A. while I worked and M.A. after retirement,\u201d Mr. Raju says.\n\nAfter completing M.A., he approached the Bharathiar University for an M.Phil. and it directed him to the Government\u2019s Arts College, where he came under the tutelage of Assistant Professor G. Subramanian.\n\nWorking with Mr. Raju was a different experience in that he had put the elderly gentleman through a lot of rigour to take him into the academic fold, Mr. Subramanian says. Mr. Raju wrote Research Methodology, Indian Writing and a few other papers before taking up the work on Ms. Deshpande\u2019s works.\n\nBut what saw them through the exercise with ease was Mr. Raju\u2019s sincerity, says the guide.\n\nNow with an M.Phil. to his name the elderly gentleman has cleared the entrance exam for Ph.D. in the Bhrathiar University and is teaching part-time in the Tamil Kalloori in Perur.",
