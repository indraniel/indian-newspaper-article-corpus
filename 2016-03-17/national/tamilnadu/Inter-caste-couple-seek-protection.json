    "text": "Fearing trouble, a couple who had an inter-caste marriage against the wishes of their parents sought police protection as there was threat from the woman\u2019s parents.\n\nThe couple from Chithaiyankottai here met the Superintendent of Police A. Saravanan and submitted a petition seeking protection to their life here on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the petition, Kamatchi Priya (25) of Chithaiyankottai, stated that she married a Dalit youth Siva Perumal in 2013. Her parents did not approve her inter-caste marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Chennai subsequently, but her mother had been threatening her frequently over phone, she said.\n\nLater, she came back to Chithaiyankottai to stay with her in-laws. Her relatives continued to threaten her and her in-laws often, she added.\n\n\u201cWe had filed several complaints with the Sempatti police station, seeking protection and demanding action against her parents and relatives. But the police did not initiate action in this connection till date.\n\nHer relatives recently entered her house and tore up her certificates and other documents in order to prevent her from joining a government job, she claimed in the petition.\n\nOn receipt of the complaint, the Superintendent of Police assured them that he would look in to the matter.",
