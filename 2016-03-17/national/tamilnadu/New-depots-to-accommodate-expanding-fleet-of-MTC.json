The depots include Semmanchery, Chromepet, Kunrathur, MKB Nagar and Padianallur. In the remaining seven depots, including Kannagi Nagar, Perumbakkam, Perambur II and Velachery, the renovation is in various stages, he added.\n\nWhile work on three new depots is in progress, land acquisition is on for the proposed facility in Thaiyur in Kancheepuram district. The project, proposed in 2011, planned to develop 25 depots as an end to problems caused by space constraints and also for effective management of vehicles.\n\nAdequate manpower\n\nThe MTC was bifurcated in September last and since then, bus depots were set up at Mahakavi Bharathiyar Nagar, Padiyanallur in north Chennai and Kundrathur, Semmanchery, and a second one at Chromepet in south. These depots had adequate manpower to attend to vehicles and each had a branch manager, the official pointed out.\n\nThe MTC had inaugurated newly renovated depots at Adambakkam and Besant Nagar, which acted as bus termini too.",
