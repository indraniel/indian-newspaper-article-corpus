Justin Antony, founder-president, International Fishermen Development Trust (INFIDET), here on Wednesday.\n\nReferring to an email received from R. Balakrishnan, Consul (Consular and RTI), Consulate General of India, Dubai, Mr. Antony said that Mr. Anthony Raj was admitted to Bandar Abbas Hospital and his condition was stable. Officials from the Indian consulate visited him at the hospital.\n\nIn his email, Mr. Balakrishnan said that all the four fishermen \u2013 M. Hilarian (51), C. David (40), K. Prabhu (41) and Anthony Raj \u2013 were taken into custody by the Iranian authorities. Though the Indian consulate contacted the Iranian Foreign Office at Bandar Abbas twice regarding the status of the fishermen, no response was received from the Iranian authorities.\n\nMr. Balakrishnan noted that the fishermen were shifted to a prison in Bandar Abbas by the Iranian authorities.\n\nThe Indian consulate had sought travel documents such as passports of the four fishermen and other necessary documents for pursuing the issue with the Iranian authorities, Mr. Balakrishnan added.\n\nThe INFIDET appealed to the Central and State governments to take immediate steps for the early release of the four fishermen.",
