    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has set aside the punishment imposed on a former police officer for having allegedly demanding and receiving a bribe of Rs. 50 each from five trainee constables when he served as Law Instructor at the police training school in Palayamkottai about 17 years ago.\n\nAllowing his writ petition pending since 2008, Justice A. Selvam quashed the orders passed by the Home Secretary in September 2005, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) in March 2004 and Tirunelveli City Commissioner of Police in July 1999 with respect to the punishment imposed on the petitioner, S. Meenakshisundaram.\n\nIn his affidavit, the petitioner had urged the court to quash the orders related to his punishment, since they were passed despite lack of evidence to prove the allegation, and direct the officials to grant him all monetary benefits after considering him to have been promoted as Inspector of Police on January 14, 2003 when his junior was promoted to that post.\n\nAgreeing with the petitioner that none of the five trainee constables had supported the charge during the departmental enquiry and they even claimed to have lodged the complaint only at the instigation of the then vice principal of the training school, the judge said that in such circumstances, the Commissioner of Police ought not to have imposed the punishment of stoppage of increment for two years.\n\nNo evidence of guilt\n\nThough the ADGP had modified the punishment to reduction in pay by two stages for one year and the Home Secretary too had confirmed the modification, these orders also could not be sustained since there was no iota of evidence of guilt against the writ petitioner, the judge added.",
