    "text": "Seven nesting sites with 888 eggs this year\n\nThe first batch of 114 Olive Ridley hatchlings was released into the sea at Narambai on Wednesday as part of conservation of the endangered species.\n\nThe Forest Department collected over 888 eggs laid by turtles over the past 60 days with the help of youth volunteers and kept them at a temporary hatchery in Narambai for safe hatching.\n\nVolunteers from the local fishing community involved in turtle protection also collected eggs and shifted them to the hatchery and closely monitored them. The eggs were preserved in areas where there was no movement of people.\n\n\u201cClassified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Olive Ridley turtles visit the Puducherry coast from January to March for laying eggs. The conservation programme was started a few years ago to protect and release the turtles into the sea after the breeding season,\u201d Deputy Conservator of Forests G. Sathiyamoorthy said.\n\nThe protection of the nesting sites is important for successful hatching of eggs.\n\nThe nesting area is covered with nets and Forest Department has deputed a person to protect the nests. The eggs take around 45 to 60 days to hatch.\n\nThis year, there have been a total of seven nesting sites with 888 eggs.\n\nThanks to the heavy protection given to the temporary hatchery, so far there has been a 100 per cent hatching rate, Mr. Sathiyamoorthy said.",
