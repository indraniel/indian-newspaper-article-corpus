Kirubanantha Murugan (38), AIADMK panchayat secretary, with the promise of getting his wife a permanent job as a Lab Assistant in a school.\n\nSix months ago, Murugan paid the money, but the promise was not kept and he claimed he was deceived by Murthy. Since, he could not get a job for his wife as promised, he demanded the money be returned.\n\nSubsequently, Murthy refused to give back the money and abused Murugan after passing casteist remarks, the latter alleged.\n\nBased on the complaint, police have filed a case against Murthy under Sections 420, 294 (b), 506 (i) of IPC and SC /ST Act.",
