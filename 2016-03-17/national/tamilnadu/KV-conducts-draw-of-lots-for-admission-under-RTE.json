Alangulam, whose husband is a farmer, said, \u201cNeither my husband nor myself had good education. I wanted to put my daughter in a good school. KV could have been affordable for us. Now, I need to try under the RTE Act in private schools.\u201d\n\nAccording to Headmaster G.S. Murugan, of the total 2,280 registered applications, 1,875 applications, which qualified under the RTE criteria, were included for the lots. \u201cOf the 160 seats, 40 seats are reserved for the RTE Act applicants,\u201d he said.\n\nTo become qualified for reservation under the RTE, one should belong to SC / ST, OBC (non-creamy layer), economically weaker sections with annual income not exceeding Rs. 2 lakh or physically challenged category and reside within a five-kilometre radius of the school, Mr. Murugan said.\n\nThe draw of lots was conducted in the presence of a six-member committee approved by Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, which included two representatives from the parents who had applied.\n\n\u201cThough only the first 40 will get seats, all the 1,875 numbers were taken from the lots to ensure transparency and also for addition to the waitlist,\u201d C. Muthiah, Principal, said.\n\nThe entire proceeding was also videographed.",
