    "text": "Illegal tapping of water from River Cauvery for farming activities continues in Paramathi Velur. The worst part is that the water is also sold for commercial purpose.\n\nWith low level of water in the river continues to be a worrisome factor for farmers along the river stretch from Jedarpalayam to Palapatti, an individual had placed a motor engine in the river and installed pipeline from the river to nearby agricultural fields.\n\nWater is drawn from the river and carried to the pipeline to the banana fields for which farmers pay a substantial amount. Also, the water is sold for commercial purpose and is transported in lorries to households, shops and for construction activities. Though farmers are aware that tapping water is illegal, they continue to do so in the past one month to save their crops. Water from the river is drawn, treated and supplied as drinking water to Namakkal, Paramathi Velur, Pothanur, Pandamangalam, Venkarai and Mohanur. With summer setting it and low level of water in the river, villagers fear that they may face water scarcity as the natural resource is exploited for commercial purpose. They said that illegal water tapping continues round-the-clock and if the situation continues, acute water scarcity may prevail in the coming months.\n\nEarlier, farmers used to draw water illegally during night hours from the river and supply it to their farm lands.\n\nHowever, water is tapped illegally from the river round-the-clock and sold to farmers and for commercial purposes. With complaints pouring in, Public Works Department officials had in past years seized a few motor pumps that were used for illegally tapping the water.",
