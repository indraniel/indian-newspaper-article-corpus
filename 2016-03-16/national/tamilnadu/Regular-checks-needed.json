The report should then be submitted to the district Chief Educational Officer concerned.\n\n\u201cHowever, this has not been done in many districts, which means that infrastructural irregularities often don\u2019t go under the scanner,\u201d said A. Narayanan, founder of Change India.\n\nMr. Narayanan had recently filed a petition in the High Court demanding the closure of nearly 746 private schools that had been functioning without permanent recognition and flouting norms with regard to safety and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe education department should step up the process this year and conduct checks across all schools during the summer vacation to ensure that students study in a safe environment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court Order also specifies that safety measures prescribed by the National Building Code of India 2005 are to be implemented by all government training schools, which also require teachers and other staff to be trained to handle emergencies.",
