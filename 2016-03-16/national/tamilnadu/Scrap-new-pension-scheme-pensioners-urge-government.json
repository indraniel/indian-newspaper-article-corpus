    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Retired Government Employees Association has urged the government to withdraw the new pension scheme.\n\nA resolution to this effect was adopted at the State conference of the association held here on Tuesday with K. Gangadharan, State president, in the chair.\n\nThe association urged the government to rectify the shortcomings in the new medical insurance scheme and issue a fresh government order allowing beneficiaries to avail medical treatment without having to make any payment. Through another resolution, the association urged the government to provide promotions to police personnel as per court orders and revise the pension for them accordingly. The pension for State government employees, who retired before December 31, 2005, should be revised as per grade pay as had been done for Central government pensioners.\n\nThe minimum pension for retired village revenue assistants, noon meal, and anganwadi employees should be fixed at Rs. 3,050, the association said.",
