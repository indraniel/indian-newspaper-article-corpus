    "text": "To alleviate fears among jewellers, Central Excise officials have come out with a number of clarifications.\n\nAfter Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced one per cent levy on the jewellery, the bullion markets across the country downed shutters opposing the duty. In Tamil Nadu, there was a total strike since then and the loss (due to closure of the shops) was estimated to be around Rs.1,000 crore in cities like Madurai and southern districts.\n\nIn a bid to put an end to the stir and also explain their stand, the Central Excise officials in many cities briefed the media persons.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here, Joint Commissioner (Central Excise) P. Rama Prasad shared a few salient features of the tax system.\n\nHe said that an artisan or goldsmith, who only produced jewellery on job-work basis need not register with the Central Excise or pay duty or file returns as all these obligations would only be on the principal manufacturer.\n\nJewellers with a turnover of less than Rs. 6 crore did not fall under the tax net. This, he said, was substantially higher when compared to normal SSI exemption.\n\nWhen a certificate from a chartered accountant was obtained, the jurisdiction officer could accept it as exempt category.\n\nLikewise, for duty-paying jewellers, the declaration by them would be accepted and there would not be any physical verification of the premises.\n\nIn fact, the jewellers\u2019 private records or records for submission of VAT would be accepted for Central Excise purposes.\n\nThe duty is to be paid on a monthly basis and not on each clearance.",
