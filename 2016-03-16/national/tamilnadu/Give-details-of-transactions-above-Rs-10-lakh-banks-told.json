Also, if banks suspect withdrawal of money of Rs. 1 lakh by any persons, they can also inform the election cell immediately. He explained the various rules that banks need to follow in monitoring the withdrawal of amount by customers and informing the officials. He also asked the banks to ensure that while transporting money for re-filling in ATM, the supervisor accompanying them should carry necessary supporting documents so that seizure of cash can be avoided.\n\nMr. Dakshinamoorthy also said that contestants in all the six assembly constituencies in the district need to open new bank accounts and carryout election related transactions in the account and inform the details to the election officials so that their expenditure is monitored.",
