Kannan has banned the festival until elections are completed.\n\nChellandiamman temple was located in Kuttarangampatti in Sendamangalam. Last year, clash erupted between two groups over the conduct of festival. A case was also filed in the court on the ownership of the temple. With festival dates nearing, a meeting was held last week to sort out the issue. RDO chaired the meeting, but the talks failed.\n\nAgain talks were held a few days ago which also failed. Hence, the RDO banned the festival until elections were over and also the judgement in the case delivered.",
