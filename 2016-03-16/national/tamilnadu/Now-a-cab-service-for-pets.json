    "text": "It was that one night that got Jayashree Ramesh and Kamal Banger to start Wagging Tails, a cab service meant exclusively for pets. \u201cMy friend couldn\u2019t find a vehicle to take her ailing dog to a hospital. She lives in Semmancherry and by the time we reached and took the dog to the vet, it died. That\u2019s when we decided to launch this service,\u201d said Ms. Jayashree, who is also an animal activist.\n\n\u201cWe were toying with this idea for a long time, but we finally decided on making it a reality,\u201d said Ms. Kamal. The duo launched the service on Sunday. They have two cars, one for the big dogs and the other to accommodate smaller ones. \u201cI drive the small car myself, or ask my husband to help out,\u201d said Ms. Jayashree. \u201cWe are looking for drivers as most of the calls that we get are from far away places like Thiruverkadu,\u201d she said.\n\nThe first service they offered was to a kitten whose owner wanted to take her for vaccination, but couldn\u2019t find a vehicle that allowed pets inside. \u201cIt is sad that animals suffer so much silently, and do not get timely help. Many do not allow injured pets inside their vehicles,\u201d said Ms. Kamal. \u201cWe are here to help to the best of our ability,\u201d said Ms. Kamal. The cab service will be provided for owners having dogs, cats and birds and will be available round the clock.\n\nPet owners can contact 9003055606 or 9841022214 to book the cab service",
