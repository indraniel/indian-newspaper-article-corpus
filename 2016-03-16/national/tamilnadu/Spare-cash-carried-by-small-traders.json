In a representation, president S. P. Jeyapragasam said small traders and the public faced hardships when cash was seized from them, following the code of conduct in the State on announcement of the Assembly election date. Small traders, especially from rural areas, visited cities to make purchases. Since they did not have a bank account, they usually carried cash for their purchases and traders did not accept cheques.",
