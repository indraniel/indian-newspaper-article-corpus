    "text": "A circular at the National Law University (NLU) has urged faculty members to contribute towards a gift for the Vice-Chancellor on her son\u2019s marriage.\n\nIn the March 8 circular, the Faculty Secretary at the Jodhpur-based NLU had requested the faculty members to \u201cmake a financial contribution of Rs. 500 each to buy a gift to be presented\u201d to Vice-Chancellor Poonam Saxena.\n\nSohan Lal Sharma, Registrar, told The Hindu : \u201cThe circular was issued by the Faculty Secretary [Rosmy Jain] and being a faculty member [at NLU] with only a year\u2019s experience she might not have known that a circular need not have been issued for the gift. However, the faculty members were not forced to make the contribution.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharma said it was a \u201cstandard practice\u201d among the staff where contributions were made whenever a faculty member retired.\n\nWhile the Vice-Chancellor could not be reached for comments, Mr. Sharma said she was unaware of the circular.",
