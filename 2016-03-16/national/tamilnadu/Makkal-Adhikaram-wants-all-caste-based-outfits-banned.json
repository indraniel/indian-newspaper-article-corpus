    "text": "All the caste outfits must be banned and the public must spurn those political parties that hobnob with such caste organisations and honour killings must be treated as sedition cases and offenders tried accordingly, the Makkal Adhikaram has demanded.\n\nIn a statement here, the Makkal Adhikaram State Steering Committee member K. Kaliappan condemned the killing of Udumalpet Sankar for marrying an upper caste girl Sowmya and said that the notorious murders on the lines of Ilavarasan, Gokulraj, and Sankar must end.\n\nPointing out that certain forums were using the caste outfits as the base to leverage with political parties for pecuniary gains, Mr. Kaliappan said inter-caste marriages had become a tool in their hands and they over ride even those families directly connected with the issue.",
