There\u2019s no need to enter into alliance with any party,\u201d she said, adding that only the BSP could safeguard their interests in Punjab.\n\nMs. Mayawati accused other political parties of being opportunist and anti-Dalit. \u201cThese parties, which today are talking about Kanshi Ram ji, have always been against reservation and had opposed his ideology,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Mayawati said she decided to reserve 50 per cent of seats for the youth at all levels in the party set up to ensure that a second line of leadership is well versed with party\u2019s ideology.\n\nBattling to bag the crucial Dalit votes in Punjab ahead of the Assembly polls, Ms. Mayawati and the Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal were in Punjab on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Kejriwal, who visited the birthplace of Kanshi Ram at Prithipur Bunga village in Ropar district on Tuesday, said, if voted to power, the AAP government would fulfil the dreams, which Kanshi Ram had seen for the Dalit community.\n\nAddressing a gathering Mr. Kejriwal said Kanshi Ram was a visionary and he should be given Bharat Ratna.\n\n\u201cHe [Kanshi Ram] has been the only visionary leader for Dalit community after Dr. B.R Ambedkar,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kejriwal accused the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-BJP government of being anti-Dalit and working against the interests of minority communities.\n\nHe alleged that people, especially the youth who are forming clubs in the name of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, were being harassed. \u201cLaw and order situation in Punjab was the worst in the country,\u201d he added.",
