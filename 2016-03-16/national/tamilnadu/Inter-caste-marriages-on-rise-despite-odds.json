It is steadily increasing every year. Last year, we performed 385 such marriages,\u201d state general secretary of the organisation, Ku. Ramakrishnan, said.\n\nHe said that the number of inter-caste marriages had actually gone up over the last two decades with more girls getting educated and getting better exposure. Around 15 per cent of the couples were students.\n\n\u201cFifteen per cent are from the IT sector, of them one or both are from other districts or nearby States,\u201d he said. Twenty per cent are inter-faith marriages.\n\nA third of the marriages involved one of them from the southern and central districts, who were getting married here due to fear of attack by the Caste Hindus.\n\nParents of either the groom or bride attended the marriage in only 10 per cent of the cases and in only two per cent of the cases did both the father and mother attend. \u201cThough they were not against the marriage they preferred keeping it a low-key affair, over fear of being sidelined by their community,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident of Social Justice Movement N. Paneerselvam who has organised 150 inter-caste marriages from January 2015 said that there were very few marriages that take place without a problem. \u201cWe have even been threatened by the Caste Hindu families on many occasions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter performing such marriages we take the couple to the police station,\u201d he said. He said that doing so gives a strong message to the families of the bride and groom as the police warn the families not to harm or disturb the young couple. \u201cDown the line some of the families accept the couple setting aside casteist sentiments,\u201d he added.\n\nLast year, Thanthai Periyar Dravida Kazhagam had performed 385 marriages",
