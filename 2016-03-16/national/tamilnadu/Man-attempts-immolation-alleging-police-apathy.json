He alleged that his brothers had threatened him of dire consequences.\n\nSeeking action on his complaint, Ravi came along with his wife Gomathi and two minor daughters to the collectorate and doused themselves.\n\nPolice personnel thwarted their attempt immediately and made an enquiry with Ravi and promised to look into his complaint.",
