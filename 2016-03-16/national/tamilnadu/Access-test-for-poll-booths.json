    "text": "Disability activists audit polling stations with an app\n\nFor the last few days, members of the Disability Rights Alliance (DRA), Tamil Nadu, and volunteers of an NGO Bhumi, have been going around polling stations in the city and auditing them with an app, to assess accessibility for the differently abled.\n\nSmitha Sadasivan, who has audited around 14 booths, said that only a few were completely accessible, while others had several issues. In some, the ramps were not accessible, in others, bathrooms were not. \u201cThis app makes it really easy to audit \u2014 you first audit the location of the booths, looking at lighting and level surfaces, for instance. Then the booth itself is audited \u2014 checking, for example, if the door is wide enough for a wheelchair to pass through. If anything is not accessible, you take a picture of it and upload it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe app, called \u2018Election Audit,\u2019 has been developed by software company Ardhika, and is available on the Android platform. However, it can only be used by registered volunteers, said Sathya Madurantakam, also of DRA. It asks the user a series of questions with \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answers.\n\n\u201cBetween 25 and 30 booths have been audited so far. The data is uploaded on the server of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO)\u2019s office. We are now working on the viewing of the data as a report. On Friday, we are planning to pull out the data and the pictures, compile a report and submit it to the CEO and the Chennai Corporation Commissioner,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the app is definitely very useful, more volunteers are needed to do audits in their neighbourhoods, said Vaishnavi Jayakumar, also a member of DRA.\n\n\u201cThis whole exercise is to ensure that the differently abled community has access to a dignified voting experience on a par with others. What happens to differently abled voters assigned to booths that are not accessible?\u201d she asked.\n\nSmitha Sadasivan, who audited around 14 booths, said\n\nonly a few were totally accessible",
