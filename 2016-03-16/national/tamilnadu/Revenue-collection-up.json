Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers\u2019 Association, says there are several new industries that are coming up in Coimbatore.\n\nMany are setting up factories here or at least the head office here and the units in the nearby towns. There is also a growth in the domestic market for many sectors.\n\nThough the anticipated demand has not come, industries say that they are seeing domestic market growing.\n\nThese could be some of the reasons for higher tax revenue.\n\nFurther, some sectors might have grown better than the rest and this will also result in higher revenue, he said.\n\nReporting by\n\nM.
