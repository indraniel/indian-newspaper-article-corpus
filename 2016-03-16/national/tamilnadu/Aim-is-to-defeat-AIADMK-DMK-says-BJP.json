To achieve this, we looked for alliance to reduce the split of votes,\u201d she told The Hindu. She was here to attend a school function. She said that it was not the duty of BJP alone to form an alliance. Other parties too should see that the people of the State needed a political change which could create a difference in infrastructure, irrigation and health sectors. The election officials need to be more alert in curbing the distribution of gifts and tokens to buy liquor.",
