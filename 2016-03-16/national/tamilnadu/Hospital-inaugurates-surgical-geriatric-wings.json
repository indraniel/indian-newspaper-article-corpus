S. M. P. Khadri, honorary secretary.\n\n\u201cAt first, it functioned completely free. Subsequently, it became a 50 paise hospital and now, it is a Rs. 15 hospital. It was begun in this area when there were no medical facilities. Even though we had difficulties getting doctors and staff to work here, from day one, we had a lot of patients coming in,\u201d he said.\n\nPrince of Arcot Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali said S.K. Khadri, founder president of the hospital, was an asset to the nation. He said medical education had become a big business. \u201cThis should be discouraged and condemned,\u201d he said. H.V. Hande, former Health Minister, government of Tamil Nadu, said Dr. Khadri was not just a human being; he was an institution. Shakeel Akhter, chairman and managing director, Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation, said it was every individual\u2019s responsibility to give back to society.\n\nS. Ahmed Meeran, chairman, Professional Couriers, and several others participated.",
