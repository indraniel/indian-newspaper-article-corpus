Info gathering shouldn\u2019t become harassment,\u201d Mr. Abdullah wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the wake of pro-JNU protests in universities in Kolkata, there were reports that the Union Home Ministry had asked for details of Kashmiri students studying in West Bengal \u201cto avoid JNU-type pro-Afzal Guru protests in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are these students being singled out? This raises the wider question \u2014 why is MHA ordering States to compile dossiers/data of J&K students like this?\u201d Mr. Abdullah asked. Interestingly, the official Twitter handle of the West Bengal Chief Minister assured Mr. Abdullah by tweeting back: \u201cIssue related to MHA. But let me assure u, people of J&K r welcome. We assure them peace of mind to enjoy beautiful Bengal (sic)\u201d.\n\nThe NC chief is angry over West Bengal\u2019s move to bring them under the scanner",
