Turmeric cultivators in the district say the procurement rate at around Rs. 9,000 per quintal is conducive.\n\nSince the start of the year, there has been stability in the rate of finger and root varieties that are traded in Erode district.\n\nThe auction centres in the district are operated by the Erode Turmeric Merchants Association; Regulated Marketing Committee; and Erode and Gobichettipalayam Cooperative Marketing Societies.\n\nThe Sangam members will not take part in the auction from March 22 to April 1",
