    "text": "A Dalit woman from Aavaraikulam in Radhapuram taluk in Tirunelveli district has filed a public interest litigation petition in the Madras High Court Bench here, accusing three caste Hindus of having constructed a 300-metre-long and six-foot-tall wall on a common pathway with the intention of usurping 69 acres of public property and attempting to convert the issue into a caste dispute.\n\nThe petitioner, A. Indira (40), accused the three caste Hindus of attempting to create disharmony between caste groups by projecting their construction as a \u201cwall of untouchability\u201d, and sought a direction to the Collector to intervene in the issue. A Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam on Tuesday directed a government counsel to ascertain the veracity of the petitioner\u2019s claim by next week.",
