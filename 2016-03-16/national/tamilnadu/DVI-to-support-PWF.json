    "text": "Dalit Viduthalai Iyakkam (DVI) has decided to support the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) in the upcoming Tamil Nadu Assembly election.\n\nThe decision was taken at a meeting of the DVI held in Virudhunagar on Sunday to discuss election strategy. It was highlighted by the functionaries during the meeting that successive governments of DMK and AIADMK had failed in retrieving and allocating the \u2018panchami\u2019 lands to Dalits.\n\nThe functionaries also blamed both the DMK and the AIADMK for running highly corrupt governments and failing to eradicate untouchability and other caste-based discrimination.\n\nConsequently, it was decided by the functionaries to support the PWF, as the front had progressive parties that voiced their support for Dalit causes. It was also decided to request the PWF to allocate at least two constituencies for the DVI. A resolution was passed to urge the PWF to include retrieval of \u2018panchami\u2019 lands in its poll manifesto. DVI State joint general secretary S. Karupaiah and president Balachandran, along with other functionaries, participated in the meeting.",
