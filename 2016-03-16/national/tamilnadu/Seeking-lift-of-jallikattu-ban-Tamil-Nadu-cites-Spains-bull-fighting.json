The affidavit also finds links from both ancient Tamil literature and Sangam era \u201cand beyond\u201d.\n\nBefore turning to global events to support its arguments in favour of jallikattu, the State affidavit said the rural people reacted to the Supreme Court\u2019s stay with a \u201cdeep sense of shock, disappointment and sadness\u201d. It contended why jallikattu is illegal when bull-fighting, where the animal is killed, has been given constitutional protection as part of cultural heritage.\n\n'\u201cThe bloody sport of bull fighting which is far more cruel and involves the killing of the bull is legal in at least eight countries including liberal and democratic countries like France,\u201d the State government argued.\n\nInculcates martial spirit\n\nIt said jallikattu inculcates martial spirit. \u201cYouth who have traditionally taken part in jallikattu have also been at the forefront of the armed struggle against the British,\u201d it said.\n\nCountering arguments that bull is a domesticated, bovine animal, the State compared it to other cloven-footed animal which can run like deer. It said a bull spends less than 30 seconds in the arena.\n\nThe State said jallikattu bulls do not experience fear as they have been reared in a \u201cvillage atmosphere\u201d.\n\nIt also finds links from both ancient Tamil literature and Sangam era\n\n\u201cand beyond\u201d",
