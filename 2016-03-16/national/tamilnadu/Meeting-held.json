    "text": "A day after the fire accident in a cracker unit at Mathiyasenai, three teams, comprising officials from the Revenue department, police and fire and rescue services, have been formed to conduct surprise inspection of fireworks units. Revenue officials also organised meetings in Virudhunagar district on Tuesday with owners of fireworks units to ensure accident-free production. The meetings were conducted at Vembakottai, Sivakasi and Virudhunagar.\n\nAccording to an official press release, speakers at the meeting insisted that only permitted varieties of fireworks should be produced by following stipulations for each product. The manufacturing process should take place within the permitted area using the permitted number of workers. The owners were told that only persons holding the permit could run a factory, which should not be leased to anyone. The inspection teams would initiate legal action if any irregularity was found during their visit to fireworks units, the release said.\n\nSeven workers were injured in the fire at the cracker unit in Mathiyasenai on Monday. All of them were admitted to a private hospital in Sivakasi.",
