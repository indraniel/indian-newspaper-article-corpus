In Ulsoor, the toxic ammonia content \u2013 through faecal matter \u2013 is high. In the afternoon temperatures, this amplifies the drop in oxygen levels of the water,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the same time, Nitrate content has lead to algal growth \u2013 explaining the greenish colour of the lake \u2013 leading to lowering dissolved oxygen levels.\n\nShe suggests that instead of a blanket announcement of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), there needs to be an in-depth study of the contents of the lake and the nutrients that need to be filtered out.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just big-ticket projects such as Sewage Treatment Plants that are needed to purify Ulsoor lake.",
