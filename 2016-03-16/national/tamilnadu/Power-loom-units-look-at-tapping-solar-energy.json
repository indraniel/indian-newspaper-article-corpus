Since these are small-scale units, they do not have the financial resources to invest in solar energy panels.\n\nIf the Governments give 50 per cent of the cost as subsidy, the units can bear the remaining amount, according to the Coimbatore Tirupur District Labour Weavers Working Power loom Owners\u2019 Association.\n\nA power loom shed with 12 looms now consumes 150 units of power a day. It is estimated that a shed requires 10 HP power. It means 20 KW of installed solar energy capacity and the total cost for solar energy system works up to nearly Rs. 14 lakh. Instead of giving subsidy to power loom units in the electricity consumption charge, the State Government should look at financial support to these units to switch over to solar energy, suggested M. Senthil Kumar, chairman of Southern India Mills\u2019 Association.\n\nThe Coimbatore Tirupur District Labour Weavers Working Power loom Owners\u2019 Association has appealed to the Central and State Governments to extend 50 per cent of the cost (which works up to Rs. 7 lakh) to each power loom unit.\n\nThe units can go in for on grid solar energy systems with net metering.\n\nThus, the power loom sheds can consume the power generated on working days and when they close down operation (on holidays and festival days), the solar energy generated can be sent to the grid.\n\nThis will make power cost economical to the power looms, these units can be self-sufficient on the power front, and the Government can supply the grid power to other industries.",
