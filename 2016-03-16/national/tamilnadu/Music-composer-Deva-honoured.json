A.B. Sudarsanam, honorary president of the Salem Amateur Arts (Trust), and D. J. Rajendran, president of the Trust, presented the title to Deva at the function held in Gujarathi marriage hall in the city. On the occasion, Mr. Deva said that in the past lyrics and music sailed together much to the liking of the music lovers. However, at present, there was no connection between the lyrics and tune in the film songs and this had disappointed people.\n\nMr. Deva presented 40 select songs composed by him on the occasion.",
