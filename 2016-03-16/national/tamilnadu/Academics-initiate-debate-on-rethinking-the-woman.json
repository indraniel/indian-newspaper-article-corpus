Thampi, Professor and Head, Department of French and also the first woman Dean of the School of Humanities, the fact that the University was headed by a woman\u2014the Vice Chancellor (i/c) Prof. Anisa Basheer Khan \u2014or that the proportion of women in the Pondicherry University has crossed 200, was an unmistakeable sign that women had carved an academic niche for themselves in this University.\n\nThe French Consul General Philippe Janvier-Kamiyama, a staunch advocate of women\u2019s rights, was one of the dignitaries at the inaugural session.\n\nThe French Department at the University was the first in India to be granted a UGC SAP Project. The seminar was organised under the second phase of this project, Prof. Thampi said. Though it was a national seminar, quite a few abstracts were submitted from academics in overseas institutions.\n\n\u201cA successful woman is one who can build a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at her.\u201d And women have amply proved that they can and they will survive, despite the brickbats or the threats,\u201d said Prof. Thampi.\n\nOn the occasion, entrepreneur Shobhana Srikanth of DHARTI was felicitated for her contribution in training marginalised women in the skills of crafting eco-friendly products, especially ethnic jute bags.",
