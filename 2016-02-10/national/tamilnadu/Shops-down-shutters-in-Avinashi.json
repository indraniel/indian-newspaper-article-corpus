    "text": "Around 60 per cent of the shops and establishments in Avinashi town were closed on Tuesday following a call made by Athikadavu-Avinashi Flood Flow Canal Scheme Struggle Committee to pressure the government machinery and get the scheme implemented.\n\nM. Velusamy and T. Sathyamoorthy, activists who were crusading for the scheme in Avinashi area, told reporters that the successive State governments had failed to fulfil the promises to implement the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe scheme, if commissioned, will recharge the groundwater in areas such as Avinashi, Chennimalai, Perumanallur and nearby towns. The surplus water taken from River Bhavani as part of the project will thus automatically help people meet the water demands for drinking and irrigation purposes,\u201d the activists said.\n\nMeanwhile, the police removed 14 persons who continued fasting on the day in support of the scheme.\n\nThey actually observed a fast on Monday and returned to continue the agitation.\n\nThey were taken to government hospitals for check up and later released.",
