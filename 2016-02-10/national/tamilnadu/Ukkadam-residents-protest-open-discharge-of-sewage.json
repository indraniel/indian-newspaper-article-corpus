    "text": "Residents of six to seven residential colonies in Ukkadam staged a protest on Tuesday afternoon by preventing sewage lorries from discharging waste into an open drain that passes through their area.\n\nLed by Councillor A. Sadiq Ali (Ward 86), the residents said that for long they had been urging the Coimbatore Corporation officials to instruct the lorry drivers to let out the sewage only into the sewage treatment plant and not into the open drain.\n\nThe lorries that collected sewage from across the city illegally discharged sewage into the drain.\n\nAs a result, the residents of J.K. Garden, Anna Nagar, Bilal Nagar, Pon Vizha Nagar, and Arul Nagar suffered foul odour and unhygienic conditions.\n\nMr. Ali said that on an average over 50 lorries discharged sewage into the open drain a day.\n\nThe second of the protestors\u2019 grievance was that dogs taken to the animal birth control centre were let out in their area and not taken back to the area from where they were caught. This had resulted in an increase in the canine population.\n\nFollowing the residents\u2019 protest, officials from the Corporation went to the spot, held talks with the residents and promised to remedy the situation. They promised to cover the drain with slabs and instruct lorries to dispose of the sewage into the plant.\n\nAs for the increase in dog population they promised a solution in 10 days after consulting with the Corporation Commissioner.",
