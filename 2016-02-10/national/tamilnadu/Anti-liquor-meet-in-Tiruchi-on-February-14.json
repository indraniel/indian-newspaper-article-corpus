It has extended invitation to all sections of the society including college students who wished the closure of liquor shops.\n\nSpeaking to media here on Tuesday, its State coordinator C. Raju said the organisation had been carrying out a sustained campaign and organising protests across the State keeping this issue in the forefront. The government was well aware of the fact that liquor affected lives of several families. Still, it was against the idea of closure of liquor shops.\n\nAlthough the government had eradicated illicit brew, it was not keen on closing liquor shops, he alleged.",
