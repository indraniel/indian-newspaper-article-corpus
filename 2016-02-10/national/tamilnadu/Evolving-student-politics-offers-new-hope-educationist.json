Organisations like the Ambedkar Students\u2019 Association or the Ambedkar Periyar Study Circle in IIT-Madras represent a new phenomenon. They question the very premises on which state policies have been made,\u201d he said. According to Mr. Sadgopal, who attempted to trace commonalities between incidents involving the APSC, IIFT and UoH as well as the Occupy UGC protest, what is happening is a synthesis of two ideas: \u201cIn Rohith Vemula\u2019s own works, you can see how he attempts to see the common links between Marx and Ambedkar. It is the same about the APSC. That is to say that on the one hand, it is a battle to end caste oppression and on the other hand, class oppression\u2026I think it is a very, very encouraging phenomena. The Occupy UGC struggle is similar when it said \u2013 in not such a forthright manner \u2013 that taking away our scholarship is a social justice issue.\u201d\n\nHe felt that the conceptualisation of studying Marx with Ambedkar is revolutionary it will help students understand the exclusiveness of the new education policy being drafted. \u201cThe economic policies of this government provide a perspective in which the new education policy can be viewed. Skill India, I think, is the most dangerous one. It is because, never in the philosophy of education, skill has been seen in isolation. Skills, along with cognition and value system make up an organic whole when it comes to education,\u201d he said.",
