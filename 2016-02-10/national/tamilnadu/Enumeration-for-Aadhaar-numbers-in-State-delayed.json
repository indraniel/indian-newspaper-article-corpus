Though printing of the books was over on time, binding them took some considerable time and it had affected our work.\u201d\n\nAbout 65,000 enumerators were to carry out the enumeration of over 1.36 lakh enumeration blocks in the State. \u201cThe enumeration work has started in most of the districts and the work would soon begin in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Coimbatore districts,\u201d he said. Every enumerator would visit every household in two enumeration blocks allotted to him and would verify the seven details of the person in the NPR and whether the details are uniform in the NPR and in the Aadhar provided to them.\n\nDelay in supply of printed material cited as a reason",
