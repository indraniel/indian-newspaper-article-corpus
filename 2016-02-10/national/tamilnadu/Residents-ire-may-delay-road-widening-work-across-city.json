Jothi Ramalingam\n\nDue to resistance from residents, Greater Chennai Corporation\u2019s ambitious project to widen roads across the city may be delayed further.\n\nIn 2014, the civic body announced the widening of 11 roads in the first phase and identified 1.12 lakh sq. m. of private land and a number of notified open spaces along the bus routes for the purpose. After preparation of a land plan schedule for the purpose of acquisition, the civic body has plans to widen roads. Many parks and playgrounds are also likely to be utilised for the road-widening projects. Work on Santhome High Road is expected to increase its width to 24 metres. Land on either side of the 1.6-km stretch is expected to be acquired. The 3.2-km-long Sardar Patel Salai would also be widened from 20 metres to 30.5 metres, after acquiring 3,286 sq. m. of private land and 18,821 sq. m. of government land.\n\nThe civic body is also pinning its hopes on obtaining land by offering Transfer of Development Rights for land owners along Nelson Manickam Road, Strahans Road, Perambur Barracks Road, Kaliamman Koil Street, Paper Mills Road and Sembium Red Hills Road.\n\nHowever, the civic body is not likely to make any decision ahead of the Assembly elections, said officials.\n\nThe civic body may offer Transfer of Development Rights for land owners",
