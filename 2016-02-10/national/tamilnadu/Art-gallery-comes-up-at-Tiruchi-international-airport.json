    "text": "The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has created an art gallery at the security hold area situated inside the new international terminal building at the airport here to showcase art works of amateur and budding artists for sale and encourage them.\n\nIt has invited expression of interest from amateur and budding artists to display their arts works in the gallery. A panel encompassing three AAI officers has been constituted by the Airport Director to select the artists and provide space for displaying their works. A maximum of 15 days would be given for displaying the art works which may be extended by the Airport Director by mutual consent depending upon the number of amateur and budding artists. The artist would have the right to put a tag \u201cfor sale\u201d and the art work would carry the price tag fixed on it. Ten per cent of the sale value of the art work would be the revenue share for the AAI and there would be no charges for the display. The artist would have to be present personally or deploy a representative at the display site. The airport received expression of interest from Poompuhar (The Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited) which would display their art works shortly. It has also received expression of interest from P. Pandu, an artist whose works (thumbnail paintings) were on display with effect from February 5. A press release said interested artists were welcome to display their art work. The art works would include sculpture or any other form of art and not limited to paintings alone.",
