P.Vasunathan, Joint Commissioner, HR&CE, Villupuram Region, has been given additional charge of the temple.\n\nThe tragedy occurred due to the absence of hand rails/ barricades in the steps of the pond, Fire and Rescue Services personnel during the festival, insufficient number of police personnel to control the crowd and lack of lifesaving equipment.\n\n\u201cEven the district administration was not informed of the festival of this magnitude. No meeting was conducted to discuss crowd management at the festival. These things are to be done by higher officials.
