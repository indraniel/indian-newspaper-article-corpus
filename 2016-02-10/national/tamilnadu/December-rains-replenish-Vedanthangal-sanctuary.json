    "text": "The incessant rains in November and December might have put citizens to severe hardship, but the birds are not complaining. The rains have replenished the Vedanthangal bird sanctuary following a disappointing 2014-15.\n\nMore than 25,000 birds have visited Vedanthangal this season which extends from November to April, according to forest department officials. \u201cAll the birds have nested. In a couple of weeks, there will be more birds when the eggs hatch,\u201d Wildlife Warden K.Geethanjali said.\n\nNorthern pink tailed ducks, garganeys, pelicans, spoonbills, black-headed ibis, teals are among the birds seen this year. The officials say some birds might stay back a little longer this year if the water levels at the sanctuary remain high.\n\n\u201cWe have desilted all the channels this year and have added fish fingerlings for supplementing the birds,\u201d Ms. Geethanjali said.\n\nHowever, about 10 kilometres away, at Karikili, another bird paradise, the scene is quite the opposite. With the water levels being high, spot-billed ducks, which need mounds to sit have, not made their presence felt.\n\n\u201cWe hear the sounds of the birds behind the trees and bushes, but they have not come to the front side this time and hence sighting is difficult. We had created lots of mounds earlier expecting them to come, but the heavy rains have submerged the mounds. We need to wait for the water levels to reduce,\u201d she said.\n\nThe department is making efforts to promote Karikili as well among tourists and bird enthusiasts. \u201cIn the past two years, we have created pathways, bird-watching platforms, drinking water facilities there,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 25,000 birds have visited the sanctuary this season",
