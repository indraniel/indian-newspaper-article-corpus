    "text": "Municipality ropes in corporates to fund facilities for low-income groups\n\nFor 59-year-old S. Marimuthu, an agricultural worker from a village near Avadi, providing food at least twice a day for his six-member family was a challenge.\n\nConsidering this, it is not surprising that he had not constructed a toilet in his house.\n\nUntil sometime ago, his family was among 5,900 families in Avadi that had not been able to construct toilets at their houses due to poverty. The Avadi Municipality is reportedly trying to reduce this number.\n\nSince 2015, it has constructed toilets more than 400 families, including Marimuthu\u2019s, under the Swachh Bharat Scheme.\n\nThe Municipality has also invited corporates to fund efforts to construct toilets for low-income group residents in their houses. In fact, a special desk to coordinate with the corporates has set up by the Municipality.\n\nThe corporates can contact the Municipality\u2019s town planning officer, S. Maran at 9841226111 and sanitary officer Palaniswamy at 9677074799 for the purpose.",
