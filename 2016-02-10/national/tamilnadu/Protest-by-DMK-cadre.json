    "text": "Over 355 cadre of DMK courted arrest on Tuesday when they attempted to march towards the newly constructed bridge across the Cauvery between Vangal and Mohanur urging the government to let the public use the bridge immediately. They said though the bridge was constructed four months ago, it had not been opened for traffic forcing people to take a circuitous route to reach Mohanur from Vangal and other villages. Though the police had denied permission, the protestors rushed to the bridge by breaking open the barricade put up by the police. All of them were arrested. Nanniyur Rajendran, district secretary, presided.",
