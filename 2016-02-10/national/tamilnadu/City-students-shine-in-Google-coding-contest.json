Since we have been learning robotics in school, I have been making such projects using simple programming from last year, which is why I was able to give this a shot,\u201d said Shrikrishna, who added that he aspired to work on building automatic cars when he grows up.\n\n\u201cAnything associated with computers and robotics fascinates me and being a movie buff, I absolutely love the concepts behind the Transformers and Iron Man movies where the characters use a lot of advanced gadgets and technology,\u201d he said.\n\nThe students had to use \u2018App Inventor\u2019 or \u2018Scratch\u2019 tools invented by MIT",
