    "text": "Priscilla Yesudas, a third year B.Sc. nursing student, was found dead in her college hostel in Madukkarai on Monday night. The Madukkarai police said that she fell from the hostel terrace while collecting dried clothes.\n\nHer parents, who are from Ketti in The Nilgiris, alleged that the girl had died under mysterious circumstances and refused to accepts the body after post-mortem examination at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. They alleged that the girl was a victim of ragging and harassment by the management.\n\nThe police said that the girl who went to the two-storied hostel terrace to collect dried clothes fell around 7.30 p.m. Before leaving the hostel room she had told her friends that she would be back soon. As she did not turn up in a reasonable time, the students and members of the college management searched and found her lying with injuries.\n\nThey rushed her to a private clinic in Madukkarai and from there to a speciality hospital in the city and finally took her to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where she died.\n\nThe police, who registered the case as death under suspicious circumstances, said that their preliminary investigation had revealed that there seemed to be no foul play. They would, however, take a final call after further investigation and getting the post-mortem report.\n\nAt the CMCH, a five-member doctors\u2019 team performed the autopsy. The parents and relatives later received the body.",
