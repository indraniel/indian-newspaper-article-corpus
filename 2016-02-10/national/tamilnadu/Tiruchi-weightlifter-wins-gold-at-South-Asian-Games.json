Abilash Christopher\u2019s voice. The weightlifter from Tiruchi emerged winner in the 105 kg category with a total lift of 317 kg (135 kg in snatch and 182 kg in clean and jerk) in the ongoing South Asian Games on Monday.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to have won gold medal. But performance wise I think I need to do even better,\u201d the 29-year-old told The Hindu over phone from Guwahati. When he was a student of Ponniah Higher Secondary School, Palakkarai, bodybuilding was his first interest. However, S. Chidambararajan of Panther Gym motivated him to take up weightlifting.\n\n\u201cHe was my first coach and has always been a great source of guidance,\u201d says Christopher gratefully. An alumnus of St. Joseph\u2019s College here, Christopher joined Central Railway, Mumbai, in 2008, thanks to some good performances in weightlifting meets.\n\n\u201cA job in the Railways made my future secured and gave me the confidence to compete in national and international levels,\u201d he says. The recent medal was his third at the international level and he is the reigning national champion in the 105 kg category.\n\nChristopher, whose wife Sushmitha is also an international weightlifter, has set an immediate goal of qualifying for the Asian weightlifting championship to be held in April, which will be a qualification event for the Olympics at Rio de Janeiro in August.\n\n\u201cI wish to qualify for the Asian championship first and then put up a strong performance there,\u201d he says.",
