To draw the attention of the Central government, all sections of people would stage a demonstration in the district on February 21, said A. Lazar, president, Bodi-Madurai Broad Gauge Project Speedy Action Committee.\n\nTalking to press persons here on Tuesday, he said the project report was prepared at an estimated cost of Rs. 175 crore. But the successive governments had allotted Rs. 20 crore \u2013 Rs.15 crore in 2011 and Rs. 5 crore in 2012 railway budget. Now the total project cost has escalated to Rs. 285 crore.\n\nWith the decision to convert the metre gauge line into broad gauge for better connectivity to upcountry, Madurai Division of Southern Railway had stopped the train service and closed traffic in this section in December 2010 and announced that the work would commence from 2011. Later, the Southern Railway had completed dismantling of metre gauge track. There was no development after this work, he added.\n\nMost of the agriculture produces such as cardamom, cotton, chilli and groundnut grown in Theni, Bodi and Andipatti and Cumbum blocks were sent to different parts of the country through trains.\n\nTraders and farmers appealed to Southern Railway to expedite the project for the benefit of people of Theni and Madurai districts.\n\nTheni was the only district that did not have rail connectivity till now.",
