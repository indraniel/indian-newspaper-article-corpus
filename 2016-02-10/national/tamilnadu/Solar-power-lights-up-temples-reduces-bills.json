MURALITHARAN\n\nA number of major temples in Tiruchi, Perambalur, and Pudukottai districts have gone in for solar power units which has brought down the power consumption bill to a great extent. According to officials, the solar units have helped bring down the power bill, though the plan involved an initial investment of Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 9 lakh depending on the capacity of the plants.\n\nAccordingly, the executive officers of Rockfort Sri Thayumanaswamy Temple, Sri Subramanyaswamy Temple in Kumara Vayalur, Sri Vekkali Amman Temple in Woraiyur, Sri Jambukeswarar \u2013 Akilandeswari Temple in Tiruvanaikovil and Sri Mathura Kali Amman Temple in Siruvachur near Perambalur volunteered to go in for solar plants.\n\nTamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) accords special concession to temples and levies Rs. 7 a unit. Even then, the temples had to shell out a huge sum ranging between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 30,000 as bi-monthly expenditure towards energy bills.\n\nThe temples have been using the green energy during the day while at night, they switch over to the power supply from Tangedco.",
