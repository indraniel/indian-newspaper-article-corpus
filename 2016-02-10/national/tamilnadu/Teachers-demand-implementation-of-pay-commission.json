In Chennai, they protested at the University of Madras demanding the University Grants Commission to implement the seventh pay commission recommendations.\n\n\u201cUsually they set up the committee as soon as the pay commission announces revision. This time the government has not constituted the committee yet,\u201d said G. Ravindran, general secretary of the Madras University Teachers\u2019 Association.\n\nThe teachers say despite repeated requests the government has made no effort to implement the UGC pay scale to guest lecturers.",
