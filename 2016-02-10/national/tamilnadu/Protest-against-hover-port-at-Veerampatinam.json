We were not consulted about the project,\u201d said S. Sundari, a fisherwoman of Veerampatinam.P.S. Sakthivel, one of the office-bearers of fishermen panchayat, said, \u201cEven as we have been opposing the project since 2004, the authorities started work at the proposed site on January 15 last and have fenced the area. The hover port is being built in the northern part of the village without any public consultation. Our worry is that it would cripple our movement and we may not be able to dry our fishing nets there.\u201d The protestors also alleged that their relatives and friends from outside the village, as well as devotees to the famous Sengazhuneer Amman Temple might face restrictions.\n\nAffect fish catch\n\nThey also claimed that the frequent movement of hovercrafts in the sea would adversely affect the fish catch.\n\nR. Mangaiyarselvan, organiser of a fishermen\u2019s welfare association, said the authorities had not taken any initiative to allay the fears of the people in the last 12 years through dialogues and discussions.\n\n\u201cInstead, they are attempting to coerce the people into giving their consent for the project. We will intensify the agitation if the authorities fail to respond to our demands,\u201d he warned.\n\nCases registered\n\nCases under non-bailable Sections have been registered against the leaders of the fishermen panchayat who went to oppose the foundation-laying ceremony.\n\nG. Sugumaran, secretary of the Federation of People\u2019s Rights, said filing cases against the leaders was undemocratic and must be withdrawn. \u201cThe government should also realise that this facility, within a distance of 50 metres, violates the Coastal Zone Regulations.\u201d",
