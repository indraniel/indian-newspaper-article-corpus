The teachers wanted the government to annul GO no 266 and give preference to teachers with a PG degree for promotions. They also wanted an assurance that the 12,000 teachers at the Adi Dravida Welfare Schools be permitted to undergo transfer counselling in their respective districts instead of being asked to come to Chennai. The representatives said GO no. 132 should be abolished and subjects like agriculture and carpentry should be taught by trained teachers. The meeting was chaired by ministers of finance, electricity, school education, higher education and local bodies. The secretaries of finance and school education and the elementary school education director also participated. But at the end of the meeting the teachers did not receive any positive response to their demand.\n\n\u201cWe were told that our demands would be put forth to the Chief Minister who will take a decision,\u201d said JACTTA coordinator P.K.
