    "text": "District Mahila Court Judge Sarvamangala on Tuesday convicted and sentenced lorry driver Balakrishnan (26) to undergo 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 on charges of having murdered his wife.\n\nAccording to prosecution, the accused hailing from Melur near Coonoor in The Nilgiris married Suganya (21) on May 5, 2011. The couple has a girl child. The accused reportedly had affair with other women and this led to frequent domestic disharmony and quarrel between the couple.\n\nOn November 6, 2013, in a fit of rage Balakrishnan is said to have banged Suganya\u2019s head on a wall, causing her death.\n\nBalakrishnan managed to bury the body stating that Suganya had committed suicide. Suganya\u2019s parents complained that there was a foul play in Suganya\u2019s death and that it was not a suicide. Subsequently, in December 2013, the body was exhumed and a post-mortem was performed which revealed that the victim died of a head injury. This led to Balakrishnan confessing to the murder. Kolakombai police arrested him.",
