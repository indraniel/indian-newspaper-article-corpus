Karunanidhi on Thursday alleged the AIADMK might promise prohibition in its manifesto.\n\nIn a statement detailing the DMK\u2019s position on prohibition, Mr. Karunanidhi said a view was being created that it was the party\u2019s government in 1971 which first lifted the ban on alcohol in the State.\n\nHe said even under the regime of C. Rajagopalachari in 1937, prohibition was in force only in four districts.\n\nThe DMK leader recalled a statement issued by former Chief Minister M.G Ramachandran in 1969 vouching for the commitment of Mr. Karunanidhi to the cause of prohibition.\n\nFurther, citing \u201creports reaching him\u201d, Mr. Karunanidhi said the AIADMK was planning to promise prohibition in its election manifesto. Citing the response given by Electricity Minister Natham R. Viswanathan in the Assembly that a ban on liquor was possible only if the policy is implemented throughout India, Mr. Karunanidhi said the AIADMK promising a ban on alcohol now would be tantamount to hoodwinking the people of Tamil Nadu.",
