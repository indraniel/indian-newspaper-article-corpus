Lakshmi Narayanan\n\nThe Salem Corporation has placed a worker under suspension for covering the statue of Tiruvalluvar with white cloth recently.\n\nThe statue is located in the Salem (North) Assembly Constituency near Old Bus Stand. It was covered by the worker Santhakumar after the model code of conduct came into force.\n\nComplaints poured in from the pubic and political parties who demanded that the statue be uncovered.\n\nDistrict Electoral Officer and Collector V. Sampath ordered the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tahsildar and Village Administrative Officer to uncover the statue. The cloth was removed on March 14.\n\nAs soon as the news of the statue being covered spread, there were several posts in the social media too with posers: \u201cWhich political party did Tiruvalluvar belong to and why the Election Commission officials were not able to differentiate between statues of political leaders and that of Tiruvalluvar?\u201d\n\nEven during a Q & A session with the hashtag #AskTNCEO organised by the Chief Electoral Officer in his official and verified handle @TNelectionsCEO on Wednesday, one of the participants tweeted, \u201cTiruvalluvar belongs to which party? Can he influence the voters? Transfer the Salem Collector.\u201d\n\n( With inputs from Dennis S. Jesudasan in Chennai )",
