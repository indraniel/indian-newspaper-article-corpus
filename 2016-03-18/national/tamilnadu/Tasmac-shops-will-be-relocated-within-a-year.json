    "text": "Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation on Thursday assured the Madras High Court that surveying the location of its 6,776 retail liquor vending shops and relocating them as per the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Liquor Retail Vending (in Shops and Bars) Rules, 2003 will be completed in a year.\n\nThe Tasmac made the submission before the First Bench headed by Chief Justice S.K. Kaul on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition moved by activist A. Narayanan seeking to declare Rule 8(1) of the Tamil Nadu Liquor Retail Vending (in Shops and Bars) Rules unconstitutional as it lays down that no shop shall be established in municipal corporations and municipalities within a distance of 50 metres and in other areas 100 metres from any place of worship or educational institutions and the exception provided to commercial or industrial areas.\n\nThe petitioner sought the court to direct the government to ensure that no liquor shop was located within 500 metres in municipal corporations and municipalities and 1,000 metres in rural areas from any educational institution, hospital, place of worship, bus stand and residential areas.\n\nWhen the PIL petition came up for hearing, counsel for Tasmac submitted that collection of data on the location of the shops would take place and if the shops are found located in violation of the provisions, those shops will be shifted with the consent of the District Collectors. Counsel sought six months time for collecting data and six months thereafter for shifting of shops. Recording the assurance, the Bench closed the PIL petitioner and listed it for filing compliance on September 16.\n\nCounsel for Tasmac sought six months time for collecting data and six months thereafter for shifting shops",
