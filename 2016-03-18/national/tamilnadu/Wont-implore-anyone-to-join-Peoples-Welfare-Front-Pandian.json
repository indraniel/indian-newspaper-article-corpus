    "text": "Says those sharing the motto of heralding a change are welcome\n\nFormer CPI State Secretary D. Pandian, on Thursday, categorically stated that the People\u2019s Welfare Front, of which his party is a constituent, is not ready to \u201cbeg\u201d anyone to join the alliance though it is open to joining hands with like-minded parties.\n\nAddressing a press conference here, Mr. Pandian said the PWF was the result of the sour experience that the other parties in the alliance have had with the two major Dravidian parties. He said the people of Tamil Nadu were looking for a change from the misrule of the AIADMK and the DMK and the PWF was a reflection of this.\n\nRubbishing reports that he was trying to secretly strike a deal with the AIADMK, Mr. Pandian said neither the party nor any individual belonging to the CPI has had any contact with the ruling party ever since the alliance broke in 2014.\n\nOn more parties joining the PWF, he said those sharing the motto of heralding a change was welcome. \u201cBut we do not have the habit of begging outside anyone\u2019s house,\u201d he asserted. He also blamed the DMK of trying drive a wedge between the constituents of the PWF.",
