    "text": "Teachers and those engaged in coaching students for IIT-JEE point out that the stress factor cannot be swept under the carpet.\n\nIt is real and students who are into IIT-JEE preparations have to learn to deal with it.\n\nA teacher from a city school, who chose to remain unnamed, said that many who opted for intensive coaching classes at the beginning of class XI were forced to drop out after their marks in school dropped, as the school syllabus was challenging too.\n\nBalaji Sampath, founder of Ahaguru.com, which has coaching centres across the city, pointed out that due to the pressure to perform, students could easily lose perspective and they might not enjoy the learning process.\n\nHe said that many students put undue pressure on themselves as a result of the mock tests. Instead of being unduly worried about performing well, they should see the tests as an opportunity to learn about their weak areas and concentrate on those, he added.\n\nStating that State board students would have a relatively challenging time preparing for the JEE, he advised CBSE students to focus on learning classroom concepts well at school which would help them perform better at the JEE.",
