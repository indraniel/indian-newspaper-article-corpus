Malar Valantina, Chief Judicial Magistrate, and G. Bhuvaneshwari, First Additional Sub-Judge, prepared the minds of students to face possible problems in family life ahead.\n\nWhile there are several laws providing succour to women affected by inimical family situations, there was a need for awareness about evading such situations, Ms. Valantina said.\n\nIrrespective of the positions women hold, the patriarchal society has an easy way of destroying a woman's dignity by casting aspersions on character. Women, in such situations, ought to courageously prove their standing well amidst men, rather than keeping away, Ms. Bhuvaneshwari said.\n\nV. Shanmugan, Chairman, Sri Nandha Educational Trust, also addressed the students.\n\nExpert sessions\n\nThere were altogether six expert sessions, three each on two days, based on a manual prepared by the National Commission for Women.\n\nThe programme culminated with valedictory address by G.P. Elango, Principal District and Sessions Judge, who is also the Chairman of District Legal Service Authority, Erode.",
