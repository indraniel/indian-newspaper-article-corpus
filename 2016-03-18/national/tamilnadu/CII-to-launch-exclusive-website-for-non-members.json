This year, the session began at Tirupur, and after Erode, the CII will hold the events at Karur, Tiruchi and Tuticorin.\n\nThere were 150 participants at the meet in Tirupur and 100 at Erode.\n\nThe top-down approach of applicants was working well. The money sanction is made within 15 days, Mr. Tripathi said.\n\nThere are four steps: furnishing of finance requirements with basic details throughwww.mycii.in, validation and auto-forwarding of application with required details to the banking partners, expression of interest by the banks, and linking of the applicant with the bank\u2019s branch.\n\nIn the near future, the CII will introduce credit rating for SMEs in association with CRISIL and insurance services, which was thought of after the losses caused to industrial activities due to natural calamities in the recent past. Five to six insurance companies have come forward to partner with CII, he said.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Tripathi, CII Erode Zone Chairman C. Devarajan, Vice-Chairman M. Chinnasami, and president of Erode District Small Industries Association R.
