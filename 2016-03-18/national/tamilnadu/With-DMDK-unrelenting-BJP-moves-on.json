    "text": "As alliance talks with DMDK stuck, the BJP has decided to move ahead in its preparations for the Assembly elections with party\u2019s State leadership beginning the process of identifying candidates on Thursday.\n\nSources said the party has finished short listing three possible candidates for every constituency in consultation with the concerned district units in a meeting in Thursday. In the next few days, the party election committee will meet and finalise the names for all 234 constituencies.\n\nHowever, the declaration of candidates may take more time since the party was still hopeful of a positive response from the DMDK. \u201cWe still think DMDK leader Premalatha is favourable for a tie-up with the BJP,\u201d a senior leader added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, BJP leader L. Ganesan said the DMDK\u2019s announcement that it would go alone was its way of stating that it will not have truck with the DMK. The possibility of a BJP-DMDK alliance was still bright, he said.\n\nSources added that in a meeting in New Delhi that involved Prime Minister Narendra Modi and national president Amit Shah, the green signal was given to finalise and release the manifesto for the upcoming elections. \u201cThe manifesto will have elements covering all the regions of Tamil Nadu,\u201d the source said.",
