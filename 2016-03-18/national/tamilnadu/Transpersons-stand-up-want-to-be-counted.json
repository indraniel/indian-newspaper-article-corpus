But at that time we hadn\u2019t been able to decide who should apply for a ticket,\u201d said the 44-year-old Sudha, who is in awe of party general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.\n\n\u201cI am really impressed by her work. Ever since she came to power, the discrimination against our people has come down. She has been instrumental in setting up drop-in centres in all districts for us, through which we get medical care and counselling. She has set aside Rs. 20 crore for homes for transgenders in Eranavur,\u201d she said.\n\nWill she contest as an independent in the event of her not getting a seat? She said: \u201cI won\u2019t as I do not want to oppose the candidate from Amma\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nShe was accompanied by her friends, who expressed their joy at her submitting the application form.\n\nAt least three other transpersons have either applied for ticket or plan to apply. This is perhaps the first time that more transpersons are planning to contest elections. All the candidates say they would serve the society in a better manner since they do not have families and have no need to become corrupt.\n\nNam Thamizhar has allotted the R.K.Nagar seat to Devi, who has already begun her campaigning. She is now busy addressing public meetings. The DMDK\u2019s Radhika has applied for a ticket from Salem (north) constituency. \u201cI have been with the party since its inception and hope to get a ticket. This is the first time I am applying. I want to create jobs and ensure proper education for my people. I am yet to get any confirmation that I will get a seat,\u201d said Radhika, who has acted with party founder Vijayakant in the Tamil film Vridhagiri .\n\nBharathi Kannamma, who polled 1,226 votes in the Lok Sabha elections in Maruai, said she planned to contest this time too. \u201cI plan to contest from a party that respects transpersons. I was in a party for two years and though the founder was very understanding and respected me, the second rung leaders did not. I think that transpersons must stand in all 234 constituencies so that they can serve the people in a better manner,\u201d she said, adding that standing in elections not only would give them an identity but also create a space for them in democracy.\n\nThere are at least 35,000 transpersons in the State who receive medical attention through the health department.",
