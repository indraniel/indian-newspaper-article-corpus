They, then withdrew their protest after the police intervened. Subsequently, the college authorities decided to withdraw the fine imposed on them while the hostels remain closed.\n\nProtesting it, a section of the affected students sat in front of the college\u2019s main entrance and denied entry to the college premises. Subsequently, the main gate remained closed even as the students were protesting against the closure of the hostels.\n\nThe agitation that started around 8.30 a.m. continued till 10.20 a.m. after the police pacified the students with the assurance that their hostels would be reopened immediately.",
