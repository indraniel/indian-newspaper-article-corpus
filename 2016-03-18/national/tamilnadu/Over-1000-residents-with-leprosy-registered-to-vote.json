Manimaran, nodal officer of the State Commission for the Differently Abled, at the chief electoral office.\n\n\u201cWe set up booths at 10 homes for people afflicted by leprosy across the State and have registered 1,131 voters. They have all been given voter ID cards,\u201d he said.\n\nThis apart, the office of the chief electoral officer was also working with registered NGOs running homes for persons with disabilities to register more residents, he said. \u201cWe are also working on making polling stations accessible to all. Apart from setting up temporary ramps, all district officers have been asked to get a team of volunteers to help residents with wheelchairs at the polling stations if required. Entrances are being made accessible and all polling stations will be on ground floors,\u201d he said.\n\nSupport is also being extended to the Disability Rights Alliance, Tamil Nadu, which is access auditing the polling stations, he said.",
