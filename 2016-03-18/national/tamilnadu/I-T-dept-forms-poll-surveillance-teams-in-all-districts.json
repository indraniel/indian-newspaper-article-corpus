    "text": "Stepping up its vigil to check the influence of money power in the election process towards the May 16 Assembly polls, the Income Tax (IT) Department has constituted surveillance teams in each of the 32 districts across the State.\n\n\u201cThe teams would be headed by an Assistant Commissioner-level officer, who would supervise three officials and six income tax inspectors. We have constituted these teams in all 32 districts,\u201d said Additional Director of Income Tax (Investigation) V. Roy Jose who is the Nodal Officer of Election Expenditure Monitoring said.\n\nReplying to a query, he said the core of these teams would comprise only officials from the IT Department but they would also have police officers, primarily for surveillance. Mr. Jose further advised the general public to possess relevant documents while carrying cash.\n\nThe Election Commission had sought the assistance of the IT Department to control the influence of money power in the May 16 polls. The IT Department has set up a round-the-clock control room with a toll free number 18004256669 and designated fax number 044-28278799 to receive complaints or inputs on illegal movement of cash.\n\nMeanwhile, several representations seeking to allow cash up to Rs.1 lakh by the general public even if the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was in force have been received by the department.",
