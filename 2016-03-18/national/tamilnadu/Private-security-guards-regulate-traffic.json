    "text": "They are not supposed to do it, says Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic)\n\nOff late, uniformed security personnel employed by private firms and hotels are found regulating traffic on the busy city roads.\n\nWhile it seems to be convenient for customers frequenting that place, on several occasions it hinders movement of other vehicles.\n\nSecurity personnel of a firm regulating traffic on the Trichy Road said that it was not aimed at hindering vehicle movement but to make the road free for the customers to the firm to cross the road.\n\nThey said it was to avoid traffic snarls during the peak hours that were becoming an increasing issue of concern.\n\nThere are quite a few places in the city where security personnel or individuals stop other vehicles on the road to help customers to their establishments or marriage halls park vehicles.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) of the city police R. Sivakumar said that private firms or their security guards have no right to hold the traffic or regulate it.\n\n\u201cSecurity guards can only direct the vehicles within the premises and help them to enter or leave the road without affecting other road users,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, other than the police there are traffic wardens, home guards and road safety patrols (schools) who are involved in regulating traffic on the roads.\n\n\u201cSecurity guards regulating or holding traffic have not been brought to our notice,\u201d he said and added that the police will study abd warn firms not to indulge in such acts.\n\nMr. Sivakumar added that the police will also workout solutions to avoid traffic snarls at such places.",
