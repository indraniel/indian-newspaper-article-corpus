    "text": "Contract workers of Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) owing allegiance to the Jeeva Contract Labourers Union affiliated to the AITUC on Thursday staged a demonstration in front of the office of Assistant Commissioner of Labour here demanding the implementation of orders on Dearness Allowance and regularisation of contract workers.\n\nLeading the demonstration, M. Sekar, district secretary of the AITUC said the Supreme Court had directed the NLC management to initiate the process of regularisation of contract workers based on a common seniority list.\n\nBut no concrete step has been taken so far and the management was adopting delaying tactic in this regard.\n\nContract workmen who had put in up to 40 years of service were facing uncertain future as they were not sure when their services would be regularised. Mr. Sekar said that the Chief Labour Commissioner in its order on September 30, 2015 had directed the management to provide Dearness Allowance to contract workers with retrospective effect.\n\nWorkers demand implementation of DA order and regularisation of contract workers",
