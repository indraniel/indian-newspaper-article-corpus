Chandran, State secretary of CITU.\n\nTill the previous rounds, the textile unit owners were of the view that they would give a total of 24 per cent hike in wages spread over four years.\n\nTthe trade unions were adamant on the view that the increase in wages should be 100 per cent considering the inflation.\n\nThe next round of talks was slated to be held on March 24.",
