Manikumar and R. Mahadevan passed the ruling while dismissing an appeal filed by an insurance company challenging a 2014 decision of a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Kumbakonam to grant compensation to a married sister of the deceased.\n\nAfter considering a host of decisions rendered by the Supreme Court and other High Courts and comparing the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 with those of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1923 the judges held that marriage of a kin could not be a reason to deny compensation.\n\nThe Bench said that the 1923 Act listed the \u2018dependants\u2019 who were entitled to claim compensation under that legislation and it did not confer a statutory right on a married daughter. However, the 1939 Act stated that all \u2018legal representatives\u2019 of the deceased were entitled to claim compensation.\n\n\u201cThere is a distinction between being dependent on the income of the deceased and receiving a contribution from the deceased, either monetarily or through the services rendered by the deceased to the members of the family, and it is a decisive factor in computing the compensation.\n\n\u201cIf the intention of the framers of the Motor Vehicles Act was to restrict the payment of compensation only to the dependants, the word \u2018dependant\u2019 as defined in Section 2(d) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act would have been incorporated in Motor Vehicles Act also,\u201d the Bench said.\n\nAuthoring the judgment, Mr. Justice Manikumar said: \u201cThe quantum of compensation or loss of contribution is not determined on the basis of monetary loss alone. It is also determined on the basis of invaluable and gratuitous services rendered by the mother or the wife as the case may be.\n\n\u201cThe legal representative, particularly a married daughter, may not be totally dependent on the income of the deceased mother for her survival or living, but still, there can be a monetary assistance, during the lifetime of the deceased. A mother can also continuously render her valuable service to her married daughter.\n\n\u201cIn the case of a married daughter, her father, mother or brother can continue to help her monetarily depending upon the need or out of love and affection. Contribution either by means of service or income or both can be taken into account to determine the quantum of compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a distinction between being dependent on income of deceased and receiving a contribution\u201d",
