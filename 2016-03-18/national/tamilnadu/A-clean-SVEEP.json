Other initiatives include setting up of flex boards with catchy slogans at junctions, printed cards with voter awareness messages being tagged on domestic gas cylinders, stickers being pasted on purified drinking water cans, and deployment of a video van to screen awareness clippings.\n\nSVEEP (systematic voters\u2019 education and electoral participation) messages will be spread through cultural and sports events.\n\nSVEEP monitoring officials have been posted in each Assembly constituency in the district.",
