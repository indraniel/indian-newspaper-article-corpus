    "text": "Former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss has urged the Centre to reject the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on Subordinate Legislation that pictorial warnings on tobacco products be restricted to 50 per cent of the packet cover.\n\nIn a statement, he said products manufactured using tobacco, including cigarette and beedi, harm not only smokers but also all those who breathe in the smoke released by the smokers. As Union Health Minister he had brought ban on smoking in public places and implemented the rule that 40 per cent of the packet covers should have pictorial warnings. He had also recommended that the warnings should be gradually increased to 85 per cent, he said. It came as a blow that just a fortnight ahead of the implementation of the rule the committee had come up with recommendations that could seriously harm the health of citizens, he said.\n\nThe recommendation has come from a committee headed by Dilip Kumar Gandhi who had maintained last year too that there was no Indian research that emphasised that smoking could cause cancer. His reason is that large pictorial warnings would leave no space for name and logo of the manufacturer which in turn could affect the livelihood of tobacco farmers and employees in beedi and cigarette manufacturing firms. \u201cThis is evidence that the committee is acting in favour of the tobacco lobby,\u201d Dr. Anbumani alleged. Instead of considering alternative livelihood options for tobacco company employees and farmers, the committee has found an easy way out by surrendering to the tobacco lobby, he said.",
