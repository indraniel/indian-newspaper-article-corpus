    "text": "MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Thursday urged the Election Commission to devise a mechanism to protect the interests of traders and businessmen while seizing money as part of the model code implementation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters here, he said that there are reports that the field-level officials have been seizing cash being taken by traders, farmers and others while checking vehicles in different parts of the State. \u201cIt is routine for them to carry money for buying goods or raw materials for their day-to-day business or trade activities. Genuine traders and farmers should not be harassed. The EC should come out with a transparent mechanism to determine the purpose of money being carried by the people,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Vaiko, however, said it is important for the EC to detect and seize money that political parties might seek to distribute to voters.\n\nAsked about the chances of DMDK joining the People Welfare Front (PWF), he said the PWF has already invited the party to join its alliance and he could not say anything more on the issue. \u201cThere could be no ultimatum for the DMDK to join us,\u201d he said. The PWF, according to him, has made a great start and has reached every nook and corner of the State in the run up to the elections. But calculated rumours are being spread to destabilise the unity of PWF, he claimed.\n\nMr. Vaiko affirmed that there would be no problem among the partners of PWF in seat sharing. Steps are being taken to form booth-level committees and monitoring committees, he added.",
