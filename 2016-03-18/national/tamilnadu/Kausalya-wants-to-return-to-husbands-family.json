Shankar, the victim of \u2018honour\u2019 killing in Udumalpet, wants to return to her husband\u2019s family once she is discharged from hospital, according to Puthiya Tamilagam leader K. Krishnasamy.\n\nThe Dalit party leader had met Kausalya at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where she is undergoing treatment for injuries sustained during the attack by an armed gang allegedly hired by her father, who was opposed to her love marriage with Shankar. \u201cShe is physically improving but is mentally disturbed,\u201d Mr Krishnasamy told journalists here on Thursday.\n\n\u201cKausalya named a few of her relatives and held them responsible for the brutal incident,\u201d he said and added the girl has evinced interest in returning to the boy\u2019s family.\n\nStating that he has made repeated representations in the Tamil Nadu Assembly seeking a separate legislation to end to \u201chonour\u201d killings, he hoped that the State and Union Governments would at least now work on this without delay. He also suggested that the government should confiscate the property of persons involve in \u201chonour\u201d killings and expressed confidence that such measures would end such heinous crimes.\n\nMr. Krishnasamy urged the State government to provide jobs for Shankar\u2019s wife and his brother. He also sought compensation of not less than Rs. 50 lakh for their family.\n\nMeanwhile, hospital authorities said that Kausalya may remain in the ICU for a few more days despite her speedy recovery.",
