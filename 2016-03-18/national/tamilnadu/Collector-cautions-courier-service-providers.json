He said the centres will be closed if they send commodities in violation of the model code of conduct.\n\nThe Collector on Thursday carried out surprise inspections at private parcel services near New Bus Stand and Konavattam. This was a precautionary measure to prevent money transaction or sending of gifts through these parcel services. Flying squads were already conducting checks to see if political parties were distributing gifts to public.\n\nHe said that parcel service providers should check the commodities they receive before sending it. If found that these centres were violating the model code of conduct, they will be closed down, he said, according to a press release.",
