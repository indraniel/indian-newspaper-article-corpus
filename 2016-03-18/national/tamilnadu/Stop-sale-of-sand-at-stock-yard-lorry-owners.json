Also, there was a revenue loss of over Rs. 1,000 crore to the government every year by the functioning of stock yard where second sales happen.\n\n\u201cThe government should cancel the license for stock yard,\u201d he added. Mr. Rasamani urged the State Government to establish weigh bridge in all sand mining areas so that overloading and damage to road were prevented.\n\nHe also wanted holiday for mining activities on Sundays so that drivers take rest, to prevent accidents.\n\n\u201cDue to stress, accidents happen. Hence, sand sales in river beds should be stopped on Sundays,\u201d he added.\n\nLicence\n\nThe president also wanted relaxation in the eligibility norm of Class 8 pass for obtaining licence for heavy vehicles as acute shortage of drivers prevailed in the State. \u201cCertificates issued by the training institute should be accepted and the State Government should take up the issue with the Centre,\u201d he added.",
