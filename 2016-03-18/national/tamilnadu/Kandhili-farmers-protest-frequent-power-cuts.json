    "text": "Farmers belonging to Kandhili and surrounding villages on Thursday staged a protest against long hours of power cut for the last one month. They said power was supplied only for two hours a day, making it impossible for farmers to water their crops, and giving a tough time for students preparing for the board exams.\n\nAround 300 farmers gathered in front of the Tangedco\u2019s office in Kandhili demanding six hours of uninterrupted power supply in the morning and another six hours in the evening.\n\n\u201cFor the last one month, we are getting only one hour power in the morning for running the pump set in our fields. We are unable to water the crops, and this has affected our livelihood,\u201d M. Nandhi, district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam said.\n\nAt least 100 villages in and around Kandhili were affected by the power cuts, he said, adding, \u201cAgain, power is supplied only for one hour in the evening, and students preparing for board examinations have been left in the dark. They are facing difficulty in studying.\u201d\n\nHe noted that officials informed that the capacity of the transformer at the Kandhili electricity sub-station should be increased, and the work can be taken up only after the elections. \u201cWe want the officials to take up this work immediately as it is an essential service,\u201d he added.\n\nFor the last one month, we are getting only one hour power in the morning for running the pump set in our fields.\n\nM. Nandhi\n\nDistrict president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam",
