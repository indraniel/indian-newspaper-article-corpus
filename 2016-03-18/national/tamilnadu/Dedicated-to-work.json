Hence, I did not take leave even for a single day,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has not used the two-hour monthly permission hours extended by the company and had been punctual to work every day. \u201cWe had two days a week as off days for the last few years. And, when I had to attend to personal work, I use to adjust my shift hours with other workers,\u201d he adds.\n\nHaving lost his mother at the age of nine and joining work almost at the same age in a local eatery to take care of his brothers and sisters, it is several years of working for Raju. \u201cGod has given me good health and there was no necessity to take leave. I find it difficult not going to work now and hence, plan to look out for job again soon,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe was an inspiration to the youngsters at work when they saw him get awards every year. \u201cWhen foreigners used to come to the factory, I was introduced as one of the best workers and when I retired, the Managing Director of Elgi personally wished me,\u201d he says with pride.",
