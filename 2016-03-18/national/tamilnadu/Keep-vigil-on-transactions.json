    "text": "Bankers have been asked to keep a vigil on high-value transactions in the run-up to the May 16 Assembly elections.\n\nAt a meeting of bankers here on Thursday, Collector V. Rajaraman said that suspicious transactions above Rs. 1 lakh and all transactions of Rs. 10 lakh and above should be informed to the District Election Officer. All vehicles used for replenishing the ATMs should carry supporting documents while transporting currency. The bankers should also monitor all transactions through the official accounts of the candidates, the Collector said.\n\nEarlier, the Collector pasted stickers to create awareness among youth who had completed 18 years of age to enrol themselves in the voter list. The Collector said that the aim was to ensure that all eligible persons, especially differently abled persons, should come forward to enrol their names to achieve 100 per cent voting in the Assembly elections.\n\nThe stickers were pasted on buses at Old Bus Stand in the town. Such stickers would be pasted in public places such as banks, ATMs, post offices and petrol pumps.",
