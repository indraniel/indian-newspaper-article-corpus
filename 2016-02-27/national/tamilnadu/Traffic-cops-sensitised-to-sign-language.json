And we wanted to teach them the right way to help others,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd what better way to sensitise people than through role play. \u201cI asked a traffic policeman to help me cross the road after blindfolding myself. He took my cane from me, held my hand and made me cross the road. But the cane is supposed to be a visually impaired person\u2019s guide to see if the road has stones or if is muddy. So we asked them to leave the cane with the visually impaired person,\u201d said Ms. Kaul. Ramesh Kumar H.B., Adugodi traffic inspector, said that the sensitisation programme was very useful to the officials, and that it will help them communicate more effectively with people. \u201cIt will help us understand simple things such as addressing their query for the right directions, tell them bus numbers and help us understand what they are trying to say,\u201d he said\n\nFor two years, since its inception, GiftAbled has so far trained 800 people on how to communicate effectively and assist people with disabilities.\n\nThese disabilities include speech, hearing, visual, physical and mental impairment. This month, the NGO plans to train people in hospitals.",
