    "text": "Stating that title deeds for house sites were not given to them despite Madras High Court\u2019s order, villagers from Mallur picketed the Collectorate on Friday.\n\nAccording to the protestors, more than 120 families were residing at Ambedkar Nagar in Mallur in thatched houses on government land. \u201cWe submitted petitions to officials demanding title deeds. Later, we approached the Madras High Court that ordered the administration to provide title deeds to us. But the officials refuse to issue title deeds,\u201d they said.\n\nThey said that members of other community had blocked the road leading to their houses and were also felling trees in their area. They staged a sit-in-protest outside the Collectorate. Police personnel pacified them and allowed a few to submit petitions to Collector\u2019s personal assistant. Following this, the villagers withdrew their protest.",
