Srinivasan, Additional Director General (Southern Region) I of the CPWD, here on Friday.\n\nAddressing a press conference, he said that though the project was yet to get official nod, the Union Ministry of Tourism had asked the CPWD to come up with architectural suggestions.\n\n\u201cWe have given designs for the roughly 400-metre-long bridge in the ocean at a proposed cost of Rs. 100 Crore,\u201d he noted. While this project was unlikely to commence in the next financial year, the Madurai headquartered southern zone IV, which covers the whole of Tamil Nadu except Chennai and Tiruvarur, was likely to carry out Rs. 350 crore worth projects in 2016-17, compared to Rs. 245 crore in the current year, Sudhir Kumar, Chief Engineer of the zone, said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Srinivasan, the upcoming projects of CPWD included an Aviation Research Centre, a high-security strategic interest project, which has been initiated by the Cabinet Secretariat of Government of India.\n\nHe said that around Rs. 100 crore had been sanctioned for the project for which 35 acres of land had been acquired near Rameswaram. Other projects included buildings for Indo Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) unit in Idayapatti near Madurai, Central Industrial Security Force unit coming up in Sivaganga district and National Institute of Technology in Tiruchi.\n\nOther pending projects include a 100-bedded Employee's State Insurance Corporation hospital in Thoothukudi and a Kendriya Vidyalaya building in Rameswaram.",
