    "text": "It is estimated that around 2.5 crore people in the country could have gall bladder stones but could remain asymptomatic, say doctors.\n\nThe gall bladder stores concentrated bile and releases it when food passes through the intestine. It helps break down food substances. Sometimes, for reasons unknown, stones form in the gall bladder. When they enter the bile duct, they could affect the liver.\n\nAccording to senior gastroenterologist Prasanna Kumar Reddy of Apollo Hospitals, gall stones could occur in individuals who are obese, those consuming high fat/high cholesterol food, those taking medication containing oestrogen, those who have a family history of gall stones, those over 60 years of age and in diabetics.",
