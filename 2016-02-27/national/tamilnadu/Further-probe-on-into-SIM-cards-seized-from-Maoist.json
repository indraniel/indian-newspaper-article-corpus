    "text": "District Crime Branch officials have commenced an inquiry into the complaints of two persons from Palladam and Udumalpet that their identity proofs were misused/ forged for obtaining Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards by some other persons for their mobile phones.\n\nA case was registered under Sections 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using forged document as a genuine one) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nInspector (DCB) M. Kanagasundaram told The Hindu the case was taken up after the two complainants realised that their identity proofs were used to obtain the two SIM cards, which were among the many cards recovered from the house where the suspected Maoist Roopesh and his wife were hiding at M.S. Nagar in Tirupur city.\n\nThe main case related to the arrests, was investigated by the Q- branch police. The complainants came to know about the forgery only after Q-branch officials conducted a deeper inquiry into the call details of the suspected Maoists arrested and the application forms they submitted to two private mobile cellular service providers for getting the SIM cards.\n\nSuperintendent of Police Saroj Thakur said only further inquiry would throw light on how the forged documents were obtained for submission.",
