    "text": "The Madras High Court on Friday directed the two-member committee constituted by it to visit the Anna Centenary Library located in Kotturpuram here at its convenience for verifying the factual position at the site and submit a report by April 15.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh passed the order on a public interest litigation petition moved by S.T. Manonmani to improve the basic facilities in the library and to ensure proper maintenance.\n\nDuring the hearing, Additional Advocate General Arvindh Pandian submitted that all directions of the court pertaining to the maintenance of the library had been complied with.\n\nOpposing the submission, senior counsel P. Wilson, who represented the petitioner, contended that the authorities in their 51-page compliance report admitted that all deficiencies had not been complied with and they simply passed the buck to some other department. According to him, toilets in the library were poorly maintained, CCTV cameras were not functioning properly, stock of books, magazines and journals were not being updated and computers were not functional.\n\nHe further alleged that over 50 posts, including that of the Chief Librarian and Information Officer, were vacant. \u201cThe Children\u2019s Section, the Palm Leaf Section and the Digital Section are dysfunctional,\u201d he said.\n\nHence, Mr. Wilson prayed the court to initiate suo motu contempt proceedings against the officials concerned for the alleged wilful non-compliance.\n\nThe judges then asked the two-member committee to inspect the library and file a report.",
