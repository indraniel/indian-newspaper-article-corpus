Shravan Krishnan, an animal rescue volunteer who was also at the spot, said the rough waves deterred the injured dolphin from getting back into the sea.\n\n\u201cAlong with fishermen and Forest Department officials there, we decided to take the dolphin back to the sea, at least by 3 km, with a fishing boat,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter ointments were applied to its wounds, the dolphin was tied to the boat and taken to the sea.\n\n\u201cWe could not risk its being out of water even for a little while so had to transport it that way,\u201d Mr. Krishnan said.\n\nKarunakaran, a fisherman and supervisor of an olive ridley hatchery on the beach, said the volunteers waited mid-sea for about an hour to ensure that the dolphin was alright and did not get washed ashore again.\n\nRough waves deterred the\n\ndolphin from getting back\n\ninto the sea",
