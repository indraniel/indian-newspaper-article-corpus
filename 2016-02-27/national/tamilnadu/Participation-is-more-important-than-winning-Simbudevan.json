Sharing his experience with students he said that he used to participate in a lot of competitions in his school days and mostly he failed to win any prizes in the initial years.\n\nHowever after a period of persistent efforts he managed to get 16 state level prizes in a year. R.Venugopal, Senior Deputy Chief Designer, The Hindu, told the students that artists cannot be produced the way engineers are produced from engineering colleges.\n\nThe artists are open to the criticism from members of the society. \u2018Only a good \u2018rasika\u2019 could become a good artist. Not only to become a painter, but to shine in any branch of art one needed the quality of appreciating beauty, he added.",
