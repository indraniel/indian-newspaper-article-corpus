Sasikumar, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Science Forum.\n\nMr. Sasikumar said that the tree had withered and its branches fell one by one in the past 10 years. Though the trunk remained intact, its roots had been damaged by termites. The cavity formed by the withered roots had become a deep pit and many times domestic animals fall into it.\n\nThe tree posed threat to people coming to the ration shop. Besides, thousands of people would participate in the Sivalaaya Ottam on Maha Sivarathiri Day on March 7. Hence, the tree must be removed before that event as a precautionary measure. In spite of repeated plea by the villagers, the appeal fell on deaf ears of the authorities, Mr. Sasikumar said.\n\nGanapathy, a resident, said that petitions were submitted to Collector, Tahsildar, Revenue Divisional Officer and Divisional Engineer of the Highways Department. Though officials did come and check the tree a couple of times, no action had been taken since 2009, he added.",
