    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday imposed costs of Rs. 2.25 lakh on nine individuals, including two DMK councillors, R. Arumugam and D. Andavar of Virudhunagar Municipality, for the inordinate delay of eight years in commencing construction of a road overbridge across a railway level crossing on Ramamurthy Road in Virudhunagar.\n\nJustice R. Mahadevan directed each of the 9 petitioners to pay Rs. 25,000 to the Chief Justice\u2019s Relief Fund since they \u201cseemed to be motivated personally against the project which was evident from the challenge made by them in the present cases without placing the actual facts and without verification.\u201d\n\nBeginning his 95-page judgement with the sigh: \u201cHere is yet another round of litigation by the respective petitioners regarding the issue of construction of an ROB in lieu of existing level crossing,\u201d the judge went on to state: \u201cThe initial notification was published in 2008. Eight years have passed since then but not even a stone has been moved.\u201d\n\nHe also recorded the submission of Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian that the delay caused great hardship to students, office-goers, and patients being rushed to hospitals in since the railway level crossing was being closed 88 times (roughly working out to 12 hours) every day.\n\nHolding that the government followed legal procedures with respect to construction of the ROB, the judge directed it to continue the process and complete the construction as expeditiously as possible while making sure that service roads were also provided simultaneously on the sides of the bridge.",
