At a public function in Yanam, he declared his support to Chief Minister N. Rangasamy to come back power in 2016 Assembly elections.\n\nContrary to his expectation, Mr. Rangasamy fielded N. Gokulakrishnan as AIADMK candidate.\n\nFrustrated over denial of the seat, Mr.Rao has not been able to decide on his next move.\n\nIt is under these circumstances, that the AINRC is now preparing to field Mr.Bhairavasamy, who is also a relative of the legislator, in Yanam.\n\nMr. Bhairavasamy was a Group B police officer and joined the service as Sub Inspector in1982. He was superintendent of police until two months ago.\n\nHe opted f orvoluntary retirement and was relieved from service on February 16. The former officer is preparing to accord a grand welcome for Chief Minister N. Rangasamy who is likely to go to Yanam for distribution of freebies.\n\nMeanwhile, posters have sprung up in Puducherry and Yanam declaring Mr. Bhairavasamy as an AINRC member and carrying pictures of him along with party chief Mr . Rangasamy and symbol jug.\n\nMr.Bhairavasamy told The Hindu, \"Hitherto I have been serving as a police officer. Now I want to serve the public of my constituency as MLA.\"",
