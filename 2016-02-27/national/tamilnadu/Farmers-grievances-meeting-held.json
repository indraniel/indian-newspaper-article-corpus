Madhusoothanan, a farmer and coordinator of Tamil Nadu Farmers Livelihood Protection Committee, said the district administration should take initiative to inform the authorities concerned about the need to make amendments in Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right to User in Land) Act so that farmlands were not used for laying gas pipelines. On crop prices, the farmers wanted the district administration to make market interventions. Collector S. Jayandhi assured the farmers from Dharapuram area of necessary steps when they raised concerns about the bio-medical waste treatment plant coming up in the area.",
