    "text": "Former Theni MP J.M. Aaroon Rashid, a prime accused in an assault case during the last Lok Sabha election, occupied a seat meant for visitors inside the district court hall, causing a flutter here on Friday morning.\n\nMr. Aroon, who appeared before the court, occupied the seat meant for visitors inside the court hall even before the court could take up his case for hearing.\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor (PCR) A. Vellaisamy strongly objected to it, stating that all were equal before the court and law. The accused should not be allowed to sit in the visitors\u2019 area of the court hall. No preference or favour should be shown to any individual. He should wait outside for his turn to appear, he insisted.\n\nTension gripped the court hall for some time over the argument that ensued between the Special Public Prosecutor and the defence counsel. The defence counsel said that Mr. Aroon was a diabetic patient and a senior politician.\n\nDistrict Judge M.M. Krishnan asked Mr. Aroon to wait outside the hall. Immediately, Mr. Aroon vacated his seat in the visitors\u2019 gallery and went out of the hall.\n\nWhen the judge called him for hearing, he entered the court hall and stood before the judge. The judge adjourned the case till March 30 for the next hearing.\n\nTheni Allinagaram Police had registered a case against Mr. Aroon and three others \u2013 Thaslim, Hakim and Ganesh Bala \u2013 as they had threatened and assaulted women members of another political party during the election campaign on April 6, 2014.",
