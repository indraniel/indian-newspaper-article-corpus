    "text": "To create awareness about the need for protecting Public Sector Units (PSUs) among the general public, the State Bank of India Officers Association (SBIOA) organised street plays at three places in the city on Thursday. Sampath Kumar, Tirupur Zone secretary of SBIOA, told reporters that the PSUs were playing a vital role in the economic development of the country and providing employment to lakhs of youth for the past many decades.\n\n\u201cIn this scenario, the moves by the government to privatise any PSU will boomerang and result in the collapse of the economic structure in the country\u201d, he said.\n\nArtistes from a Chennai-based organisation choreographed and acted in the street plays which were held near Old Bus Stand, near Railway station and near Nanjappa Corporation Higher Secondary School.",
