With funds drying from global organisations and no prevention programmes happening, the government cannot insist on consent for testing for children.\n\nThere are quite a few children below the age of 18 years, born to positive parents, some of who have died. While for a few children who have been adopted by NGOs, consent can be sought from the organisations, there are orphans and street children. Who will give consent for these children? Should they be denied access to testing knowing fully well that only medication will help them stay alive,\u201d asked P. Kausalya of Positive Women\u2019s Network.\n\nWhile the Bill has included those infected with HIV and their affected families, it has ignored the most-at-risk populations (MRPS) such as homosexuals, sex workers, transgenders and injection drug users.\n\n\u201cWe have a high risk group that must be included in the Bill as they need the services,\u201d said R. Selvam, president of Network for Chennai People Living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nRekha Shetty, senior legal officer at Lawyers Collective, which has been conducting consultations with the various groups in different states, said network groups in 28 States had sought the support of Members of Parliament in their respective States but without much success.\n\nAccording to Daisy David, a representative from Tamil Nadu Network of Positive People, around two lakh people who were infected and affected were planning to launch a protest if the demands went unheeded.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018as far as possible\u2019 deleted from the clause referring to provision of anti retrovirals\u201d",
