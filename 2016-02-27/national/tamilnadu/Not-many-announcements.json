    "text": "In the Corporation budget for 2016-2017, presented by Corporation Taxation and Finance Committee Chairman S. Santhanam, fewer announcements pertaining to civic development and welfare projects have been made, as compared to the previous three budgets.\n\nSome of the announcements are: introduction of multi-level car parking in all zones, 5,000 bins for garbage collection, plugging of sewage inlets in stormwater drains, rainwater harvesting structures in stormwater drains, a commercial complex in Kannappar Thidal, office buildings on Anna Salai and Shenoy Nagar and more parks to increase the green cover from 9 sq. km. to 135 sq. km. within the city.\n\nMayor Saidai Duraisamy said the civic body had implemented 271 works announced in the previous budgets in the last four years.\n\n\u201cAs many as 171 works are under way. In 52 months, we have implemented 93.6 per cent of the announcements. Only 27 works have been shelved,\u201d said Mr. Duraisamy. Of the capital expenditure, construction of stormwater drains would get the largest share estimated, at Rs.415 crore.\n\nInstead of increasing the tax rates, the civic body will use GIS mapping to bring all buildings under the property tax net. The civic body has allocated Rs.50 crore for Amma Theatres and Rs. 21 crore for implementation of the Amma mineral water scheme.",
