Rajan Chellappa presented the budget here on Friday, which contained nothing new or development-oriented.\n\nWhile the lone Communist Party of India (Marxist) councillor Chellam termed budget presentation a wasteful exercise, the AIADMK members commended the Mayor and described it as pro-people budget. The DMK members were absent and the PMK councillor Veerakumar regretted less allocation of funds for extension colonies.\n\nThe Mayor said that with the sole objective of extending welfare measures to the poor and needy, the Corporation had created a number of infrastructural facilities during the last four years. Despite funds crunch, basic amenities for the citizens of the Temple City had been provided. Importantly, the vegetable market and omni bus stand, which were posing problems in the heart of the city for vehicle users, had been shifted.\n\nBuildings for fruits market (presently situated in the city) were being constructed and it would move to the new premises soon, he said.\n\nThe Corporation provided people below poverty line with a number of assistance.",
