Pandian said almost all parties in the State have backed the demands of the delta farmers and that they hoped that the AIADMK would also support their demands.\n\nThe struggle in front of Parliament was to highlight the issues including constitution of the Cauvery Management Board, Cauvery Water Regulation and Monitoring Authority, dropping plan to build reservoirs across the Cauvery at Mekedatu and Rasimanal, extending CISF security to the Mullaperiyar Dam, among other subjects.",
