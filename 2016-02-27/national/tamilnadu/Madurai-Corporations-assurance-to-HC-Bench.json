    "text": "The Madurai Corporation has given an assurance to the Madras High Court Bench here that it shall not implement an order passed by its former Commissioner C. Kathiravan on February 5 to remove advertisement boards put up by Foundation of Occupational Development (FOOD), a Chennai-based non-profit organisation, at Mattuthavani integrated bus stand here.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam recorded the submission made by Corporation counsel and directed incumbent commissioner Sandeep Nanduri to honour the commitment made before the court. The order was passed while disposing of a writ petition filed by Layola Joseph, Executive Director of FOOD, challenging the validity of the order passed on February 5. Contesting the writ petition, Corporation counsel G.R. Swaminathan contended that the writ petition was not maintainable at all since what had been challenged was an internal correspondence between the Commissioner and Executive Engineer (Planning). Stating that the petitioner had not been served with any official order, he said the internal correspondence would not be given effect to.\n\nThe correspondence stated that FOOD had been granted permission on November 25, 2010 to establish passenger shelters inside the bus stand and use them for placing advertisement boards. Stating that the permission had been cancelled with the concurrence of Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa on February 5, the commissioner had ordered removal of all those advertisements. However, the corporation counsel stated the order issued to the Executive Engineer shall not be implemented and that the petitioner organisation would be put on notice if it was decided to issue fresh proceedings in the future.",
