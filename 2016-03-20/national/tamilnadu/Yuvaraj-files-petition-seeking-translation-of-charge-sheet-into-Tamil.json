Gokulraj murder case has submitted a petition in the court seeking translation of the 1,318 page charge-sheet that was served on him recently.\n\nOn March 3, charge-sheet was served to all the 17 accused, including seven detainees under the Goondas Act and 10 accused, who were on bail. Since the case was registered under SC/ST Act, Chief Judicial Magistrate S. Malarmathy transferred the case to Principal District Judge court and asked all the 17 accused to be present in the court.\n\nOn Thursday, Yuvaraj was brought from Vellore Central Prison, while the six other accused were brought from Salem Central Prison.\n\nIn the absence of PDJ, the case came up for hearing before the Additional District Judge V. Sampathkumar. Yuvaraj submitted a petition seeking translation of the charge-sheet in Tamil. The judge extended the custody of Yuvaraj and six others till March 30.\n\nYuvaraj also circulated a five-page letter to the media that urged the Superintendent of Police, Tirupur district to conduct the investigation in the Dalit student murder in a proper way. The letter said that the first mistake in Gokulraj murder case investigation was that the law was not followed and hence, the investigation went in the wrong direction.",
