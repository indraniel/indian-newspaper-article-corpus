    "text": "Experts in Public Health, entomology, sanitary engineering, government administration and voluntary organisations came together to discuss environmental sanitation and how it could be used to eradicate dengue in the city at a conference organised by the Tamil Nadu Health Development Association.\n\n\u201cThe Aedes mosquitoes, which cause dengue, cannot fly over 100 m which is why there should be more focus on eradication at ground level. If we step in and prevent water stagnation at the local level in each area, it will have a greater impact,\u201d said C.S. Rex Sargunam, President of the TNHDA.\n\nPublic assets\n\nEchoing his views, M.R. Jaishankar, Society of Public Health and Environmental Engineers, stressed the need to carry out an audit of the public assets in each area.\n\n\u201cThe sources of water stagnation are many \u2014 including abandoned buildings and tanks which very often, are ignored,\u201d he explained.\n\nStating that while many infrastructural projects had capital expenditure, he pointed out that there were never provisions for maintenance costs which contributed to good environmental sanitation and could go a long way in preventing such disease outbreaks.\n\nRecalling an initiative by the Corporation in 2005, M. Panneerselvam, former Chief Engineer, Chennai Corporation, said they de-silted all the canals including the Buckingham canal after nearly 30 years.",
