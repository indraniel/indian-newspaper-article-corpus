    "text": "The Centre should revoke its announcement to reduce interest rates on Public Provident Fund, Kisan Vikas Patra and other small savings schemes, as the cuts will hit the poor and middle class people hard, PMK founder S.Ramadoss said.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the RBI cut lending rates by 1.5 per cent and banks slashed interest rates on fixed deposits by 1.5 per cent. However, the banks cut its housing and motor vehicles loan rates only by 0.45 per cent,\u201d he said, adding that the measure to cut interest rates on small savings schemes and the stance of banks of loan rates were affecting the general public.\n\nDr. Ramadoss said the government policy to bring parity between bank interest rates and small savings rates was wrong. \u201cPeople normally park their surplus funds as bank deposits, while small savings schemes are preferred for long-term and savings for the future. Besides, Small savings are mainly intended to provide social security. The government\u2019s move is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss said the proposal by the Standing Committee of IIT Council to raise fees at IITs to Rs. 3 lakh and NITs to Rs. 2 lakh would force students to enrol in private educational institutions.\n\nThe former Union Minister said students face stiff competition to enter these prestigious institutions not only because the fee is low but also because it provides high quality education.",
