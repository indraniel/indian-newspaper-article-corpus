    "text": "People in Bhavani town have learnt to put up with stray horses causing obstruction to roads.\n\nThough the Bhavani Muncipality had tried once in the past to confine the straying animals in enclosures, the effort did not bear fruits since there were none to claim them.\n\nThe local body finds it tough to trace the owners of the animals. Travelling in horse-carts was common in Bhavani town till 10 years back. Horse races are still being conducted at the time of Diwali.\n\nThe owners who remain anonymous look after the foals, but desert the ageing horses and injured ones. The horses move in herds, feeding on wastes strewn by the roadsides.\n\nThe local body, sources said, feels handicapped since there is no recognised horse shelter in the region.",
