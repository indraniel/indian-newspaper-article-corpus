Anwardeen said the terrain, the tall lantana bush and the fact that tiger was due for its feed did not give the teams too many options to the team tracking the tiger.\n\nWhile darts could have been tried after it emerged out of the bush, it had almost immediately pounced on the teams, denying that opportunity of capturing the tiger alive. While AR constable Ravi was being treated at Gudalur, Santhosh of the STF who suffered injuries in his hip had been shifted to a hospital in Perunthalmanna in neighbouring Kerala.",
