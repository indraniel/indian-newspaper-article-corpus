    "text": "While for months the Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK) indicated that it would want to be with the AIADMK for the upcoming Assembly elections, the lack of any concrete response from the ruling party has pushed the Muslim-dominated outfit into the DMK alliance.\n\nMMK president M.H. Jawahirullah pulled a big surprise on Saturday when he tuned up at DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin's house at noon. He also met DMK president M. Karunanidhi later.\n\nSources in the MMK said though it sent explicit feelers, the AIADMK showed no concrete interest in drafting the party into its alliance. \u201cDespite AIADMK meeting smaller parties over the last few days, the MMK did not get any response,\u201d said a leader on condition of anonymity.\n\nMr. Jawahirullah though maintained that it was a decision made after wide consultations with party leaders. \u201cOur leaders felt an alliance with the AIADMK may not be ideal as we differ on some crucial issues like prohibition,\u201d he added.\n\nThe MMK contested the 2011 elections as part of the AIADMK alliance and won two of the three seats it contested.\n\nIn the 2014 Parliamentary elections, it moved to the DMK side and lost the lone constituency it fought. The party has a sizeable presence in the southern districts, particularly in Madurai and Ramanathapuram.\n\nWith the MMK\u2019s entry and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) already stating that it would be with the DMK alliance, the front now has the two biggest Muslim parties in Tamil Nadu on its side.\n\nMuslims constitute about 6 per cent of the State's population according to Census 2011.\n\nA party leaders says there was no response to feelers sent to AIADMK",
