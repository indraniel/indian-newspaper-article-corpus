With each tree having 15 nests, the number of hatchlings was high.\n\nIf the residents had not intervened, many of these hatchlings would have been preyed upon by dogs or run over by vehicles.\n\nWhen they first found the hatchlings on their premises, many of them wounded, they informed the Wildlife Department.\n\nWith the guidance of the department, they tied large-sized nets to the tree barks to prevent anymore hatchlings from falling and injuring themselves.\n\nIn this manner, in 10 days, they saved around 60 birds.\n\nNaresh Kumar, one of the residents who was active in saving the birds, says, \u201cThe hatchlings were kept at fenced parking slots and fish was fed to them. After a few days, the hatchlings would be handed over to Arignar Anna Park where they would be nurtured till they were grown up enough to be let off.\u201d\n\nSoon, another set of hatchlings would be given to the park.\n\nUnusually this year, large numbers of birds including little egrets, and cormorants visited the colony which has dense greenery.\n\nNishanth Ravi, a volunteer with the Wildlife Department, who was involved in rescuing the birds at the quarters, says, \u201cFollowing the torrential rains this monsoon, the lakes in and around the city were filled with water and this had attracted many birds during this nesting season.\u201d",
