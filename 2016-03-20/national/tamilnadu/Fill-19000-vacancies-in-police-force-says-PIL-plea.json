    "text": "Proposing that a delay in recruiting for over 19,000 vacant posts in the police department would affect the administration of the State, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition has sought the Madras High Court to direct the government to fill the vacancies immediately.\n\nHowever, in view of the elections being notified, the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh said, \u201cThis does not preclude the government taking notice of the fact; so that steps are taken immediately post the elections in view of the large number of vacancies.\u201d The Bench then directed the authorities to dispose of the representation of the petitioner dated January 12, on or before June 15.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, State police said in reply to a query under Right to Information Act (RTI) that 19,157 posts under various categories are lying vacant in the department.",
