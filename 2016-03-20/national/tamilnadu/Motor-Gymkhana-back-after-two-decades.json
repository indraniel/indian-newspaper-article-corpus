    "text": "The popular Motor Gymkhana is back in the city after close to two decades. Organised by the Coimbatore Auto Sports Club, the one-day show will be held at the VOC Park grounds here on Sunday. The Motor Gymkhana features both the two and the four wheelers. It is one of a kind event and can well test the skills of the riders and the drivers at various levels.\n\nThere will be a scooter class, motorcycles up to 150 cc, 151-250 cc and above 250 cc and hatchback, sedan, SUV and Open categories. And the organisers have included a separate class for the ladies as well.\n\nThe events lined-up are exciting. A \u2018Zig-Zag\u2019 race and \u2018Stopping on the Line\u2019 for two and four wheelers and \u2018Garage\u2019 and \u2018Blindfold\u2019 for the four wheelers and \u2018Slow Speed\u2019 for the two wheelers.\n\nThe idea behind the Zig-Zag race is to help the participants to improve the control over their vehicles and to negotiate the curves through traffic. The Garage helps improve parking ability in crowded areas and in line with the parking markings. The Slow Speed event is to figure out if the participant has a better control over his vehicle in crowded areas and Blindfold is to check the driver\u2019s coordination with his navigator.\n\nTo ensure a smooth and safe event, all precautionary measures have been taken such as barricading of the ground, security personnel and standby ambulances.\n\nThere will also be attractive trophies up for grabs for the winners.
