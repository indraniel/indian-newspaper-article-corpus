Subramanian of Karthikeyapuram said residents had raised this issue at every forum they have access to. He said that when Madipakkam was a village panchayat in 2009, a consultation report was submitted for a Comprehensive UGD project at a cost of Rs. 30.59 crore, which had to be dropped for want of funds.\n\nIn an RTI application filed by him, he was informed that land acquisition to build sewage pumping stations in Madipakkam was on. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the UGD scheme for Madipakkam would be taken up and after getting funds from the government, tenders would be called for civil works, the reply said. There had been no progress since then, Mr. Subramanian said.\n\n\u201cMadipakkam, a village panchayat with a population of over 70,000 and part of St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union, was merged with the Corporation in 2011. While the surrounding areas such as Ullagaram and Puzhuthivakkam got the underground drainage network, it is still a mystery why these two wards (187 and 188) have been left out,\u201d said N. Balasundraram, another resident, who was part of a delegation that represented their grievances to the Mayor in 2014 and 2015.\n\nMembers of civic groups said sewage lorry operators charged exorbitant amounts to clear sewage from septic tanks.\n\nMadipakkam, a village panchayat, was merged with the Corporation\n\nin 2011",
