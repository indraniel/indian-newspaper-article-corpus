    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation Ltd should be brought under the control of an IAS officer from the pool of election observers and the \u201cpolitically-appointed Chairman\u201d should be stopped from intervening in the operations of the cable network, the PMK said in a petition to the Chief Election Commissioner.\n\nAccusing the ruling AIADMK of blocking \u201cTV channels that bring neutral news to the public,\u201d party president G.K. Mani said, \u201cif any TV channel airs news that is against the AIADMK, the TV channel is either blocked totally or pushed to the last lot\u201d.\n\nMr. Mani alleged the Arasu Cable chose only AIADMK men as operators.\n\n\u201cThe AIADMK men operating the district cable TV and Tahsildars are reviewing TV channels daily and block TV channels if any news item supporting opposition parties and criticising the ruling party is telecast,\u201d he said. \u201cTo ensure there is no favouritism in allotting channel numbers, they have to be reallocated by the lot method,\u201d Mr. Mani said in his petition.\n\nChief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said he would look into the petition if the issue was brought to his notice from the EC. \u201cI have not received any such petition from them so far. If the EC forwards it, we will provide a suitable reply after looking thoroughly into the issue,\u201d he said.",
