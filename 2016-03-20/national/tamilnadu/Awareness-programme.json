    "text": "With the mushrooming of financial institutions across the State, the college students were sensitised to the frauds committed by a section of unscrupulous companies. The programmes were organised by the Economic Offences Wing at Muthayammal Arts and Science College in Rasipuram, Vivekanandha Arts and Science College for Women in Tiruchengode and King Arts and Science College recently. Officials said that companies promise exorbitant returns for meagre investments. People, lured by false promises, invest their hard-earned money and lose it. The officials asked the students to be cautious over such frauds and inform their parents to exercise caution before investing in fake companies. An awareness short film was also screened. - Staff Reporter",
