The Chennai City Police has purchased over 100 vehicles, which are to be distributed to the two-wheeler patrol team that is functioning in various parts of the city.\n\nA senior official of the Chennai City Police said the two-wheelers were purchased more than a month ago to strengthen the patrolling system of a growing city.\n\nThe two-wheeler patrol vehicles that are fitted with flashlights and sirens would be added to the existing patrol fleet of 403 two-wheelers, the official added.\n\nIn the meantime, rumours did the rounds on social media about over 800 two-wheelers purchased for patrol beat having been left neglected for several months.\n\nHowever, the senior official denied the motorcycles had been kept in the open, as these rumours suggested, and said that they were kept in a store room that was manned by police officials.\n\nThe delay in registering the vehicles at the Regional Transport Office was the cause for the two-wheeler patrol vehicles not being distributed to the policemen. Steps were being taken to have the vehicles distributed to the patrol team, he said.\n\nThe Police are awaiting the completion of registration formalities for the handing over of 10 new mini buses for transportation purposes.",
