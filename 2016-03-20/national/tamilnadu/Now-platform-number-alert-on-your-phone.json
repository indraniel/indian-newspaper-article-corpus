While passengers with smartphones can download the National Train Enquiry System (NTES) app, those without data connection can also learn about the platform number well in advance by sending a short messaging service (SMS) to the helpline 139, a press release said.\n\nAccording to officials, the station master decides the platform for each train departing from Chennai Central and as soon as it is done, the details will be fed to the NTES terminal. The terminal, the officials said, was now placed near the station master\u2019s office so that the information was uploaded immediately. When passengers entered the train number, the platform number would be displayed immediately.",
