Manoharan, an agriculturist who was also running a voluntary organisation in Nagapattinam, met with an accident on Thanjavur-Nagapattinam highway and was admitted to the Government Hospital in Thanjavur on Wednesday. Investigations revealed he had suffered severe brain stem injury and was declared brain dead on Friday.\n\nMr. Manoharan, who was the son of Nagai Rengasamy, a freedom fighter, had registered his name for donating his body after death. As per his wish, his son Dr. Prabhu, a casualty medical officer, at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital in the city and his daughters, approached the Cethar Hospitals to retrieve the organs.\n\nThe patient was shifted to the city hospital and his liver, kidneys, and eyes were harvested. The liver was used for a patient with end-stage liver disease requiring transplant at Cethar Hospital. The kidneys were sent to Meenakshi Hospital in Thanjavur and Kidney Care Centre, Madurai. Both the eyes were sent to AG Eye Hospital, Tiruchi.",
