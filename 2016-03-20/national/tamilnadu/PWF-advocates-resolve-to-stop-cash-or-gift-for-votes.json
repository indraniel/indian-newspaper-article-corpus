    "text": "Advocates of the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) have resolved to stop the violations of election model code of conduct in Tirunelveli district and distribution of cash or gifts for votes.\n\nA resolution to this effect was passed in their meeting held here on Saturday with Arasu Amalraj, MDMK\u2019s State legal wing deputy secretary in chair.\n\nThe meeting said the PWF would form a 5-member advocates\u2019 wing in each Assembly segment in the district to prevent poll code violations such as distribution of cash or gifts for votes, coercing the cadres of PWF from doing election-related work etc. The development works being carried out and road repair works taken up after the model poll code came into effect should be stopped immediately. Or else, the advocates\u2019 team would stop it.\n\nThe official machinery should not be misused by the ruling party and the Election Commission should take action against violators in an unbiased manner. Harassment of traders and the public in the guise of checking their vehicles and belongings by the flying and the static squads should be avoided. The meeting resolved that more than 200 advocates of the alliance would participate in the PWF\u2019s advocates\u2019 wing conference to be held at Tiruchi on March 26.\n\nLawyer and former MLA R. Krishnan of Communist Party of India (Marxist) explained in detail the responsibilities of the advocates of PWF and the things to be done during electioneering for ensuring free and fair poll.\n\nApart from the PWF advocates, office-bearers of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi participated in the meeting.",
