Muralitharan\n\nThe Dravidar Kazhagam, at its two-day State social justice conference, which got under way here on Saturday, has called for a jail bharo agitation on April 18 demanding the immediate appointment of the 206 trained \u201carchakas\u201d (priests) of various castes in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) temples in the State.\n\nAmid loud cheers, the resolution read out by K. Veeramani, DK president, said the agitation would be yet another milestone in the long history of the party and its journey to realise the dream of its founder Periyar E.V.Ramasamy.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court judgment on appointment of archakas in December last year, Mr. Veeramani said the court had not given a negative judgment on the issue.\n\nIn the absence of legal ban, he had written to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on December 21 to appoint all those trained by the government as archakas in the HR&CE temples. It seemed that the Government was not interested. Hence, the DK had no other way except to organise the agitation to press their demand.\n\nMr. Veeramani said he would lead the agitation, in which more than 7,000 functionaries have reportedly committed themselves to take part. The conference gave a clarion call to the electorate to unseat the AIADMK government.\n\nThe party pledged support to the alliance under the leadership of the DMK.\n\nEarlier, Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan, former Chief Judge of Gujarat High Court, inaugurated the exhibition of the conference. DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin and TNCC President E.V.K.S.Elangovan are scheduled to participate in the conference on Sunday.",
