They find themselves out of work due to the protests.\n\nThe current strike, which is ten days old, had caused the greatest damage. Several goldsmiths say they have not got new orders for over a month.\n\nHowever, hoping that things would get better, shops on several streets off NSC Bose Road like Edapalayam Street that serve as a hub for goldsmiths are being opened.\n\nK. Kanthan, a goldsmith from Sowcarpet, said he returned to work after a leave of several days.\n\n\u201cWe had shut shop last week in solidarity with the protesting jewellers. Business has been dull as we hardly get 50 per cent of the normal orders. Goldsmiths, who normally get a weekly salary between Rs. 3,000 and Rs.5,000, now earn only Rs. 500 due to the strike.\u201d\n\nSeveral goldsmiths are forced to borrow or pay from the investment meant for business to pay workers.\n\nN. Ramachandran, who runs a unit in Edapalayam Street, said: \u201cI asked workers to go on leave for two weeks. Normally, I get orders for one kg of gold every month. But, we have been able to make gold ornaments weighing only 100 grams.\u201d\n\nGoldsmiths in the city decided to open shops as levy of excise duty may not affect them directly. Of the over 20,000 goldsmiths spread over the city, nearly half of them are based in Park Town and Sowcarpet. D. Jayagopi, president of Park Town Gold and Silver Workers Welfare Association, said several workers who give shape to Tamil and Bengali designs have been out of work as only 25 per cent of the normal orders are received.\n\nA few stores have opened even as the associations are yet to arrive at a solution.",
