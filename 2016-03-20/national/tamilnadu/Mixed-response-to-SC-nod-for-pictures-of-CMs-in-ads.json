For instance, when they see a leader urging them to look after the girl child, many will follow it. Similarly, for the illiterate among the population, the face of a leader and the government\u2019s emblem denote that the advertisement has a message for them,\u201d said Thamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader Panruti Velmurugan.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu government had also sought a review of the apex court\u2019s previous order that restrained the use of such photos. For the ruling AIADMK, though it is of no use at the moment with the Assembly election announced, it is a victory of sorts for the party.\n\n\u201cWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s photo is projected, the BJP\u2019s image too is boosted, similarly for other parties too. Nowadays, as far as the AIADMK is concerned, even if there is no photo of Amma [Jayalalithaa] it does not matter since her face and image are imbibed in everyone\u2019s hearts. It might be useful to promote lesser known persons,\u201d said a party leader.\n\n\u2018Government symbol enough\u2019\n\nVirugambakkam resident C. Anbu said that while he meant no disrespect to the Supreme Court, government symbols were enough to carry the message across. \u201cI feel that the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and their Cabinet ministers should come forward and give it up,\u201d he said.\n\nR. Sridharan, an advertisement professional, said that to take across the message the photos of leaders was not necessary.\n\nA former government official said that with this ruling the Supreme Court had endorsed unnecessary expenditure in the form of advertising.\n\nState had sought a review of the previous order that restrained use\n\nof photos",
