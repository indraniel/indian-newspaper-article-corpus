    "text": "Chief Minister Jayalalithaa wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday seeking a direction to officials of the Ministry of External Affairs to get 10 Tamil Nadu fishermen stranded in Kuwait repatriated.\n\nIn her letter, Ms. Jayalalithaa said, \u201cNecessary steps may also be taken to ensure that the fishermen receive their just and due wages. I request immediate action in this matter as their families and dependants in India are anxious about the safety of these fishermen and are also suffering without any means of livelihood.\u201d Referring to reports, she said 10 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and one from Kerala had been detained by the Kuwait police in a foisted case. The sponsors who hired them in July last year for fishing work have not paid them as per the terms of employment after engaging them for six months and were not allowing them to return home.\n\n\u201cThey have been detained by the local police on a foisted case based on a complaint lodged by the sponsors and released after a month\u2019s detention. It is reported that their passports are under the custody of the sponsors who are neither allowing them to work nor return to India,\u201d she added.",
