Raju, president, Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers\u2019 Association (AIEMA), said the industrial owners who had been facing financial distress because of the flooding saw a glimmer of hope when Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced that the meters would be replaced free of cost and electricity charges for industrial units that did not operate during the floods would be waived. While the officials of Tangedco have replaced the meters, they have not made good the promise of the Chief Minister to waive the electricity charges.\n\nCircular\n\nHowever, a senior official of Tangedco said a circular had been issued to officials of Chennai, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore to replace meters free of cost and not to collect electricity consumption charges from the affected industrial consumers.\n\nBut Mr. Raju complained that the local officials have denied the issue of any such circular.",
