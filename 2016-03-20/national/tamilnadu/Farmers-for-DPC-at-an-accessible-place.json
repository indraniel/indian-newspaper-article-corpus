    "text": "Farmers of Munneerpallam made an attempt to block the road on Saturday, demanding the authorities to shift a paddy direct procurement centre (DPC) to an accessible place.\n\nAfter the DPC was opened on the premises of a private property at Munneerpallam last year, involvement of brokers and individuals forced the farmers to sell their paddy only after paying commission to them. Those who resisted the forcible collection of commission had to face the wrath of brokers and most of the farmers had to take back their paddy after the officials refused to procure it citing \u2018excess moisture content.\u2019\n\nEven before the harvest season started this year, the farmers submitted petitions to Collector M. Karunakaran seeking his intervention to open the DPC at a common and accessible place.\n\n\u201cHowever, the officials have opened it near an irrigation tank, which is about 2 km away from the fields and farmers find it difficult to take their produce there,\u201d said Velmayil, Tirunelveli district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam.\n\nCondemning it, the farmers, led by Mr. Velmayil, attempted road blockade on Palayamkottai - Papanasam highway on Saturday. However, the police pacified them with the assurance that they would negotiate with the officials concerned to shift the DPC to an accessible spot.",
