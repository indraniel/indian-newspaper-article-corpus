Manikumar and C.T. Selvam made the observation while dismissing a public interest litigation petition filed by Raja Mohan alias Mohan, a former ward member of Manachanallur Panchayat Union in Tiruchi district, accusing a group of people of having encroached on Government Tharisu (fallow) land in Sanamangalam village.\n\nWriting the judgement for the Bench, Mr. Justice Manikumar said: \u201cIn a country like India, poor and landless people, some times encroach upon government \u2018Poromboke\u2019 (waste) lands. Encroachments made over a period of time have also been recognised by the government so as to enable them to seek patta (land ownership document) if such lands are not required by the government.\n\n\u201cUnless and until public at large are affected by causing obstruction either to a pathway or rearing of cattle or any other genuine public purpose, eviction cannot be sought on the sole ground that there are encroachments. In so far as removal of encroachments is concerned, it is for the authority concerned to decide whether the land allegedly encroached is required by the government or not.\u201d\n\nFurther, rejecting the petitioner\u2019s plea to restrain Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) officials from providing power supply to the houses of the encroachers, Mr. Justice Manikumar said such a direction could not be issued since access to electricity should be considered as a basic human right besides being part of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\n\u201cElectricity is an implicit component and facet of human right. Lack of electricity supply is one of the determinative factors affecting education and health. It causes economic disparity and inequality in society. Since electricity aids in accessing information and gaining knowledge, children without electricity supply at their homes cannot even imagine of competing with those who enjoy power supply.\n\n\u201cLack of electricity denies equal opportunities in the matter of education and consequently in employment, health, sanitation and other socio-economic rights. Without providing the same, the Constitutional goals, like justice, liberty, equality and fraternity cannot be achieved. The weaker sections do not crave for power in hierarchical positions, they crave only for electric power,\u201d the judge observed.\n\nHe also pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code uses the expression \u2018occupier\u2019 and not \u2018land owner\u2019 to refer to an applicant with the intent of providing power supply even to encroachers of government lands on submission of written undertakings that provision of service connection would not confer a right on them to claim ownership over the land.",
