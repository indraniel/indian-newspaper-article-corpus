    "text": "The Society for Community Organisation (SOCO) Trust and Justice Shivraj V. Patil Foundation have appealed to the Union government to enact an exclusive law against honour killings.\n\nA resolution to this effect was passed at a seminar condemning honour killings as crime against humanity here on Saturday. Another resolution sought adequate protection for spouses in inter-caste and inter-religious marriages.\n\nInaugurating the seminar, G. M. Akbar Ali, former Judge, Madras High Court, strongly condemned honour killings and said that one could not talk of rights in a society with primitive beliefs. He felt that women\u2019s rights, bonded labour and honour killings were inter-related and said that women could bring an end to their problems with a fighting spirit. Women should be aware of their rights before fighting for them, for which education was essential. Only education would empower women to get their rights, he said.\n\nAccording to a press release, Mr. Akbar Ali released the English translation by R. Krishnamoorthy, High Court advocate, of a book on bonded labour authored by journalist B. Thirumalai and S. Selva Gomathi, Deputy Director, SOCO Trust. The first copy of the book was received by S. Gnanam, former State vice-president, All India Democratic Women\u2019s Association. He also gave away the Lifetime Service Award to Ms. Gnanam and D. Janet Vasanthakumari on the occasion.",
