Vedhan\n\nFarmer incomes were in focus on Saturday when National Commission on Farmers chairman M.S. Swaminathan reviewed the implementation of the recommendations that were submitted nearly 10 years ago.\n\nProf. Swaminathan said technology could only increase yield; it takes public policy to take care of the economics of agriculture.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make farming viable and retain young people, your first goal is to improve the economic viability of farming and substantially increase the net income for farmers,\u201d he said, recalling a central concern of the NCF as it went about its work during 2004-2006.\n\nHis talk, delivered at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, was at an event that saw the launch of the website of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies, a Bangalore-based charitable trust.\n\nN. Ram, publisher of The Hindu , chaired the panel, which included Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha.\n\nMr. Ram prefaced the session by saying, \u201cThe NCF recommendations are perhaps the most important intervention in the thinking about Indian agriculture in several decades.\u201d\n\nIn the light of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley\u2019s Budget promise to double farmers\u2019 income in five years, the NCF proposal on fixing minimum support price (MSP) of a crop at the cost of production of that crop plus 50 percent came to be discussed the most.\n\n\u201cIt can be done, but requires a lot of work and action,\u201d said Prof. Swaminathan on the possibility of doubling farmer incomes. On his Commission\u2019s MSP recommendation, he said, \u201cIf this single step is accepted, it will make a lot of difference.\u201d\n\nMr. Mollah was, however, sceptical of the success of the income objective. \u201cProf. [Swaminathan] mentioned that income will be doubled. How we can we believe it? We have calculated it \u2013 for doubling farmer incomes in five years, 14 percent growth is required. With the (current) one-and-a-half percent growth, how will we do it,\u201d he asked at a presentation during which he said that it was pre-election propaganda that led to the last Budget adopting a pro-farmer tone.\n\nHe also talked of how the MSP recommendations of the NCF had led to a nationwide demand by farmers for implementation of the report.\n\nHe pointed out that there remained a yawning gap between what the NCF set out to achieve and the current status of agriculture in the country. \u201c[It] recommended (loans at) four per cent, but actual farmers are taking loans for between 30 and 120 per cent,\u201d he said\n\nProf. Swaminathan said, \u201cThe latest Budget takes some of our recommendations forward. For example, Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare: we recommended that the name of the ministry should be changed; the Prime Minister announced this in his August 15 speech. The reason is, we should not focus on productivity alone, but the well-being of the farmer,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Swaminathan dwelt in detail on the pressures of land and income on agriculture. \u201cPunjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee\u2026. That is the crisis in Indian agriculture,\u201d he added.",
