    "text": "Manimaran\u2019s Pugazh gets off to a shaky start. After a brief prologue hinting at dangers in the present, we slip into the past, into clich\u00e9. The hero \u2013 Pugazh (Jai, in his comfort zone) \u2013 heads to Puducherry with friends in order to drink and ogle at pretty blondes. Then, on to the heroine, Bhuvana (Surabhi, yet another of those heroines who, in this milieu, looks like a model for the \u2018after\u2019 half of a Fair & Lovely commercial, who strayed into the audition room for the \u2018before\u2019 half). Her one character trait \u2013 she stands up for her beliefs \u2013 is hammered home till the home is in splinters. She won\u2019t stand for someone dumping garbage in front of her house. She won\u2019t stand for a fish seller charging extra. After a few scenes, she forgets she has this trait. She slips into regular heroine duties, making moony eyes at the hero, sulking when their engagement is called off instead of giving him a piece of her mind. I mean, if she could get so worked up about fish...\n\nPugazh is ostensibly about a playground in Walajapet, Vellore, that\u2019s being eyed by a greedy (and well-connected) developer \u2013 but this playground is a MacGuffin. It only seems important. The meat of the film is a character study about Pugazh\u2019s friend Venkat and a small-time politician named Das (Marimuthu, who\u2019s become a specialist in playing casually understated evil). But here\u2019s the thing. Das isn\u2019t the one-note bad guy we know from the movies. When Pugazh first locks horns with Das, the latter shoots him a look that says, \u201cI\u2019m going to be your sworn enemy till the end credits roll.\u201d But unlike villains in most other films of this nature, it isn\u2019t personal for Das. It\u2019s business. He doesn\u2019t really care about settling scores with Pugazh. He just wants to do his job, without anyone coming between him and the money he badly wants to make, something his disgruntled wife keeps pointing out.\n\nAnd so we inch into the film\u2019s most interesting aspect, the reminder that politics, for some, is a job \u2013 only, the salary comes in briefcases instead of a bank deposit at the beginning of the month. In many ways, Pugazh is Venkat\u2019s story. He\u2019s unemployed. He\u2019s neck-deep in debt. He needs a job. Hence, politics. Pugazh is the latest in a line of films \u2013 Poriyaalan, Madras \u2013 where a hackneyed angry-young-man plot is livened up by grit, texture. It\u2019s fiction with the journalistic underpinnings of non-fiction. We are privy to the inner workings of a caste-based party that\u2019s fighting elections against a secular party, and we see the hierarchies. Venkat looks up to Das. Das looks up to the minister, whose son-in-law wants that playground. (Like the playground, the son-in-law only seems important \u2013 he\u2019s a MacGuffin villain.)\n\nThe people seem down-sized, real \u2013 even the sidekicks (a flirty friend, a wisecracking friend played by RJ Balaji). They contain contradictions. Pugazh\u2019s brother Arasu (Karunas, very effective in a rare dramatic role) rails at Das for his part in the death of an old man \u2013 the preachy mouthpiece for the director\u2019s messages; mercifully, he comes under a truck \u2013 but after Das drives off, he turns to Pugazh and vents a ton of frustration, born of the middle-class instinct to stay out of others\u2019 affairs, especially when those others are powerful people. Pugazh himself is no saint. He sees Venkat\u2019s soul corroding before his eyes, and when he asks Venkat to quit politics, we brace ourselves for a high-minded speech about values and integrity, seasoned with a splash of indignation. But Pugazh has a (relatively) selfish motive as well. When people cannot find Venkat, they land up at Pugazh\u2019s doorstep with their complaints, saying that they voted for Venkat because Pugazh asked them to. (He even asks Bhuvana to cast an illegal vote, under someone else\u2019s name.) Pugazh is a collection of good bits of writing, good intentions, but they don\u2019t add up to a consistently good film because it wants to be both a rooted ensemble drama and a masala-style solo-hero narrative.\n\nWe get neither. Venkat\u2019s arc needs closure. His character, after a point, feels as if there are parts the editor forgot to splice in. (These missing parts must exist alongside the scene that tells us what happened to Bhuvana\u2019s job offer, in Hyderabad. It\u2019s brought up once, then everyone forgets about it.)\n\nbaradwaj rangan\n\nPugazh\n\nGenre: Action\n\nDirector: Manimaran\n\nCast: Jai, Surabhi\n\nStoryline: Yet another angry young man fights the system\n\nBottomline: A middling drama somewhat redeemed by grit, texture",
