    "text": "Former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss has urged the Centre to reject the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on Subordinate Legislation that pictorial warnings on tobacco products be restricted to 50 per cent of the packet cover.\n\nIn a statement, he said products manufactured using tobacco, including cigarettes and beedis, harm not only smokers but also all those who breathe the smoke released by smokers.\n\nAs Union Health Minister, he had brought a ban on smoking in public places and implemented the rule that 40 per cent of the packet covers should have pictorial warnings. He also recommended that the warnings be gradually increased to 85 per cent, he said.\n\nIt came as a blow that just a fortnight ahead of the implementation of the rule, the committee had come up with recommendations that could seriously harm the health of the citizens, he said.\n\nThe recommendation has come from a committee headed by Dilip Kumar Gandhi who had maintained last year too that there was no Indian research that emphasised that smoking could cause cancer.",
