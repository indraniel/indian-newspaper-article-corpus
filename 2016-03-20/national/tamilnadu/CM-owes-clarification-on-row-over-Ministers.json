Pannerselvam and Natham Viswanathan.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Minister must clarify the questions that are being raised,\u201d Mr. Elangovan stressed.\n\n\u2018Alliance sealed\u2019\n\nSpeaking to reporters here on Saturday, he said the Congress and the DMK would begin seat-sharing talks in a few days.\n\n\u201cThe alliance between the Congress and the DMK is a done deal. This has been confirmed by the leadership of both the parties. We will begin the seat-sharing talks in a few days,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Elangovan was answering a question about the alliance since Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would not be attending the Dravidar Kazhagam\u2019s social justice conference in Tiruchi. The alliance has been cemented, and all that remained was to discuss who got what and how many seats.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the apparent soft criticism by the DMK of the murder of Dalit youth Shankar in broad daylight in Udumalpet for marrying an upper caste girl, he said that DMK was a secular party and always fought for the rights of backward classes and Dalits. \u201cThe conference is tomorrow and this issue will be discussed,\u201d he said.\n\nCongress and DMK would begin seat-sharing talks in a few days, says Elangovan",
