    "text": "Constructing a school building with three classrooms at Kathirimalai, a remote hamlet on Bargur hills, was quite a challenge for Round Table Erode.\n\nOvercoming odds, the local Round Table persisted and succeeded in implementing the \u2018Freedom Through Education\u2019 project of Round Table India. The new building for the residential school was commissioned earlier this week, and handed over to Tribal Welfare Department, for the benefit of 70 children.\n\n\u201cEducation is the bedrock of any society. It is the greatest engines of growth for this nation. Countrywide, Round Table India has constructed 5108 classrooms for 1811 schools at a cost of over Rs.150 crore benefiting over 5.62 million children. Likewise, the project undertaken for the benefit of tribal children in Kathirimalai is unique,\u201d R.Vishnu Prabhakar, National Convenor - Business Networking and IT, Round Table India, said. It took 18 months for Round Table to construct the building since there was no access to the hamlet located on a hill. One has to walk for at least 14 km in the hill climbing boulders with walking stick.\n\nThe motorable roads end at Thanda and Govindapadi hamlets from where the Round Table utilised mules and donkeys for transporting construction material through the rough jungle terrain. The odds the Round Table had to overcome included lack of electricity, non-availability of labourers and adverse weather conditions. The project was carried out in coordination with the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan scheme of the school education department.",
