The industry will benefit if there is a uniform norm across the country, said K. Purushothaman, senior director \u2013 Tamil Nadu and Kerala of NASSCOM.\n\nReacting to the Chief Electoral Officer\u2019s statement that such a request was against the law, and therefore could not be allowed, Mr. Purushothaman said that over 40 per cent of the employees in the IT and ITES companies in Tamil Nadu are from other States and they would not benefit from the holiday.\n\nFurther, critical works could not be stopped at the IT and ITES companies. The industry is ready to grant permission to those who want to cast their vote and then come to work or grant holiday to those who want to go to their hometown, he said.\n\n\u2018Industry will benefit if there is a uniform norm across the country\u2019",
