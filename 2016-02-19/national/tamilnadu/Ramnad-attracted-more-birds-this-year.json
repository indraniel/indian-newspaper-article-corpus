Ganesalingam, Forest Range Officer, who led the census, said. Thanks to the good storage of water in the sanctuaries and select waterbodies, ducks such as Northern pintail, Garganey, Common coot and Eurasian coot arrived in large numbers, he said.\n\nTo attract the winged visitors, the forest department had released 10,000 fingerlings each in Sakkarakottai, Therthangal and Kelaselvanoor sanctuaries and this has paid rich dividends, Mr Ganesalingsm said. Besides, the department had created habitat facilities in the sanctuaries, he added.\n\nAn analysis of the census data revealed that more than 44 species of migratory birds arrived during this season, he said adding a large number of Lesser flamingos flocked the shallow waters in Kothandaramar temple, Muhuntharayar Chathiram in Danushkodi and Valinokkam areas.\n\nMelaselvanoor and Keelaselvanoor sanctuaries attracted the largest number of 7,102 birds, followed by Sakkarakottai Kanmai (5,130 birds), Therthangal (4,890 birds) and Big Tank (3,332 birds), he said. More than 6,000 flamingos were sighted in Valinokkam area and 4,352 in Danushkodi area, he added.\n\nThey adopted transect method for surveying the birds and identified fresh water, sea water and brackish water migratory birds. They included pelican, painted stark, open billed stork, white ibis and classy ibis, he said.\n\nThe district continues to be the preferred destination",
