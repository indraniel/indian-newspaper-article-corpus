    "text": "Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) members were arrested when they blocked the road close to the Collectorate on Thursday alleging that the State Government had failed to provide employment to the promised number of youth.\n\nAmong other demands raised by the agitators include closure of all liquor shops and speedy execution of Athikadavu- Avinashi Flood Flow Canal Scheme.\n\nC. Nandagopal, district president of DYFI, said the State Government had promised to give employment to 87 lakh people, but fell wide of the target in the last five years.\n\nThe DYFI members were of the view that the employment generation utilising the natural resources too had not taken place at the desired pace.\n\nThe DYFI men actually planned a march to the Collectorate to press their demands. When the police tried to prevent them en route from heading to the Collectorate, they broke the police cordon and sat on the road blocking the vehicles. Around 80 people were arrested.",
