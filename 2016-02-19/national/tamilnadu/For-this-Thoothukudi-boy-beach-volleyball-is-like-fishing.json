Mugesh, a student hailing from fishermen community, has brought laurels to Thoothukudi by representing the winning team in the beach volleyball tournament organised by School Games Federation of India (SGFI).\n\nThe eighth standard student of Caldwell Higher Secondary School, Thoothukudi, represented Tamil Nadu, which beat Goa in the finals. The under-14 national-level beach volleyball tournament was held at Nagapattinam in January.\n\nThe boy, who was doubly happy, told The Hindu here on Wednesday that he did not want to rest on his laurels as he also got qualified to play in the under-14 international beach volleyball tournament.\n\nExuding optimism, the 13-year-old boy said that he could possibly win the game at the international level too and bring home more laurels.\n\n\u201cIt was always my ambition to get a job in railways through sports quota,\u201d he said. A resident of Threspuram, a coastal hamlet in Thoothukudi, Mugesh said that he had been devoting time every day playing volleyball in the shore while simultaneously paying attention to education at school.\n\nC. Belin Basker, Physical Director, said that every year students of Thoothukudi had been making their presence felt at State-level beach volleyball tournaments.\n\nLast year, a Thoothukudi student from another school participated in an international beach volleyball tournament.\n\nThanks to a seashore ideal for practice, scores of beach volleyball players would certainly emerge from Thoothukudi, he said.\n\nThe boy was lauded by his school correspondent, S.T. Chellapandian, Headmaster S. Prabhakar Thiruthavakumar Samson, Physical Education Teacher S. Muthukumarasamy and coaches.",
