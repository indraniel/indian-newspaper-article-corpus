Krishnaswamy\n\nEnvironmentalists from across the State came together to discuss ways to safeguard depleting waterbodies, at Chennai Press Club on Wednesday. The discussion was a culmination of their month-long cycle rally to spread awareness of the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe want the higher authorities to take cognisance of encroachments, and this seemed to be the best way to campaign,\u201d said Piyush Manush, member of Mariamma Utharavu, a group that has been working towards conserving waterbodies. Members of this group say they have travelled across Salem, Wallajah, Kancheepuram, Vellore and over 10 other districts to meet and educate people about their campaign.\n\n\u201cWe were 12 people cycling in these places with placards stuck on the front of cycles. Many came forward to learn more about the campaign, and many joined us in the rally,\u201d said Piyush. \u201cWe have cleaned several lakes and ponds in the last few months and the amount of garbage found in them is mindboggling.\u201d\n\nAfter coming to Chennai, the group held a meeting with educationists and activists at Loyola College to chalk out a plan to conserve the waterbodies. \u201cAll we need is support from people and authorities,\u201d said Rekha Ramu, coordinator from the Organic Farmers Market.\n\nThe month-long cycle rally saw activists visiting 10 districts to educate people",
