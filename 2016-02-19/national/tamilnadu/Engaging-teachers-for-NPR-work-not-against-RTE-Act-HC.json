Manikumar and C.T. Selvam passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by Tamil Nadu Primary School Teachers Federation which pointed out that Section 27 of the RTE Act prohibits deployment of teachers for non educational purposes except the decennial census and duties related to disaster relief and elections.\n\nRejecting the petitioner federation\u2019s contention, the judges agreed with Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) G.R. Swaminathan that updating of NPR database should be viewed as a continuous exercise of the census and hence there was nothing wrong in engaging school teachers for the work on holidays and after school hours on other days on payment of honorarium.\n\nThe judges also recorded the submission of the ASG that the Tahsildar of Musiri Taluk in Tiruchi district had actually committed a mistake by issuing a letter, on January 25, which was relied upon by the petitioner federation to drive home their point that primary school teachers, at least in his jurisdiction, were being forced to carry out the survey even during school hours.\n\n\u201cThis writ petition is disposed of with the observation that the members of the petitioner federation shall not be required to carry out the work during school hours,\u201d the judges concluded.",
