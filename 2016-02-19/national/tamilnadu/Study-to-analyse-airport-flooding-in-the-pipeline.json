The rest of the wall has to be strengthened so that next time such a disaster strikes, there is no flooding on the airport premises.\u201d\n\nExperts from the IIT noted that there was extra pressure from the Adyar river water at two locations of the boundary wall, he added.\n\n\u201cBased on this report, we had started the strengthening work sometime ago but we want to go further and carry out an extensive study for developing a full-fledged mitigation plan. They will look at how the carrying capacity can be increased,\u201d he added.\n\nA consultant will carry out the study and give recommendations, he said. \u201cWe will soon call for tenders for the appointment of the consultant and we hope this work will be completed in six months,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the floods that hit the city in December last year, Chennai Airport was severely affected and shut down for at least four days.\n\nThe runway was flooded and flight operations were suspended.\n\nSubsequently, it was discovered that owing to the floods, the boundary wall had been damaged at various locations and repair work was started.\n\nIIT-Madras has presented a preliminary report to the Chennai airport",
