After a 13-month window period, the State roped in 16 projects involving investments of around Rs. 5,081 crore in February 2014.\n\n\u201cTwo-third of these MoUs has translated into actual numbers and work has commenced,\u201d the official said. \u201cIn September 2015, 98 MoUs worth Rs. 2, 42,160 crore were signed and many of them have gone live and some are waiting for clearances from the Guidance Bureau and Industries Department,\u201d he added.\n\nThe official also said that the Foreign Direct Investment Equity inflow into the State has gone up in the last four years. \u201cFrom April 2000 to April 2011 the cumulative FDI inflow into the State is USD 7,341 million.
