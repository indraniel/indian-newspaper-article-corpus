    "text": "Southern India Mills\u2019 Association, representing textile mills in the State, has asked the State Government to reduce power tariff for high tension consumers, and consider separate tariff for textile industry.\n\nAssociation chairman M. Senthil Kumar, in a press release here, said that coal price has reduced from Rs. 3,591 a tonne to Rs. 5,399 in the last couple of years. Furnace oil price, excluding Value Added Tax, has also come down from Rs. 39.55 a litre to Rs. 17.81 and that of HSD (High Speed Diesel) oil has declined to Rs. 36.25 a litre from Rs. 51.70 a litre. Since price of fuels for power generation has come down and power is available under open access at a lower cost too, the power tariff should be reduced.\n\nThe State is now having surplus power though power consumption has increased by 33 per cent in the last five years. Tamil Nadu should be able to meet the future power demand and continue producing power to meet this requirement. It can enable the industries here to be competitive only if power is available at lower cost.",
