He was first noticed around 3 p.m., standing on the arch-shaped parapet of the bridge. Fire and Rescue Services personnel and the police tried to talk to him, but he did not respond.\n\n\u201cWe spread a net on the ground along the railway track. When our men climbed the arch to bring him down, he moved further and threatened to jump if they tried to get near him,\u201d Station Fire Officer Pon. Tirumurugan said. He was seen talking to someone over his mobile phone, he said. However, around 5 p.m., he jumped from the arch and fell on the ground after hitting a railway catenary cable, a few feet away from the net. The youth was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he was declared dead. The body was taken to Government Rajaji Hospital for post-mortem.",
