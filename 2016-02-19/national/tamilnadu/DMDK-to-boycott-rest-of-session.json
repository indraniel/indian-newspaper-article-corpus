Chandrakumar raised a few points, several Ministers shot back and disproved his claims. Environment Minister Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam also added that the MLA should show some gratefulness since it was with the support of the AIADMK that DMDK members were elected. Mr. Chandrakumar, in turn, stated that it was because of an alliance with the DMDK that Mr. Venkatachalam was able become a Minister. Irked by his response, Electricity Minister Natham. R. Viswanathan asked why the DMDK drew a big blank in the recent Lok Sabha elections. Pointing out that the people supported the AIADMK in both the local bodies as well as the parliamentary elections, he expressed confidence that the party under the leadership of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will win all 234 seats in the polls. To this, Mr. Chandrakumar made some remarks which were immediately expunged from records. After his plea to expunge the comments of Mr. Venkatachalam was turned down by the Speaker, the DMDK MLAs walked out. Mr. Chandrakumar told reporters the ruling party members had wantonly disrupted his speech.\n\nRuling party members wantonly disrupting my speech, says Chandrakumar",
