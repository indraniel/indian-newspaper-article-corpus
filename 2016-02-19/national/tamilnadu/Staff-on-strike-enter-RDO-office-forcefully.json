But the protesters were denied entry into the Collctorate.\n\nSecurity was tightened at Tiruvannamalai District Collectorate and barricades were placed in every entry leading into Collectorate complex. Police allowed every single person into the campus only after thorough checking.\n\nHence the protesters plan of entering the Collectorate for the purpose of a protest was foiled. But they immediately changed their plan and moved towards the RDO\u2019s office. However police was mobilised there too immediately. They closed the gate of RDO\u2019s office and arrested the protesters and forcibly led them into police vehicle. There was altercation between police and protesters. Soon the arrested protesters were all released.\n\nMeanwhile, the protesting employees broke the gate of RDO\u2019s office with big stones and forced their way into the campus.
