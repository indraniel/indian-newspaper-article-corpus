    "text": "The Bharathidasan University has launched a student information portal for the benefit of its students.\n\nUsing the web portal, students could get bonafide certificates, fee receipts, no-due certificates, hall tickets, provisional mark statement and other related documents. Examination applications can be submitted online through the portal, according to a university press release.\n\nStudents can access the portal to download their certificates and other documents required by them from anywhere, anytime and even with their laptops and mobile phones. The portal will reduce the time and effort taken by the students to obtain various certificates and necessary information from the departments and administrative offices of the varsity. The portal is an integral part of the office automation project of the varsity aimed at automating all academic departments and administrative sections. The office management system has been developed and maintained by the University Informatics Centre.",
