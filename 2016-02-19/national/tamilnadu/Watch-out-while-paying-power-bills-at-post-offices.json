    "text": "Some consumers paying their electricity bills through post offices have been facing delays in their bill payment status getting updated.\n\nConsidering this, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) recently instructed its officials to be cautious in proceeding with disconnection of services. Consumers who produce receipts of bill payment must be spared even if their names are on the defaulters list.\n\nAt present, post offices accept payment of bills for Aircel mobile phones, electricity and BSNL landlines. On an average, nearly one lakh e-payment transactions are done through post offices every month. The Department of Posts earn nearly Rs.7 lakh through e-bills.\n\nA few consumers in some parts of the city note that they think twice before approaching post offices for paying bills as they feel there is a delay in updating the payments. There are also issues like the software system suffering technical snags during transaction and payment links normally remaining unavailable.\n\nConsumers have been facing delays in their bill payment status getting updated",
