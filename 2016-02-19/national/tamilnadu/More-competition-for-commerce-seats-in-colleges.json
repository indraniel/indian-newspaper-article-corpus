Sanjana, a class X student of the school, said she planned to join the commerce stream and eventually pursue Master of Business Administration (MBA).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still thinking of other options too; so, these career guidance sessions should help me,\u201d she added.\n\n\u2018Focus on science\u2019\n\nN.
