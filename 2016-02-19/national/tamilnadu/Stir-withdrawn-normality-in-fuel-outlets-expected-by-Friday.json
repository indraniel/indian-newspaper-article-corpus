Police personnel were posted in the outlets to prevent untoward incidents.\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nadds from Krishnagiri\n\nMotorists were left high and dry hours after petrol bunks had brought out their \u2018no stock\u2019 boards much ahead of the petrol dealers strike on Wednesday night here in the town.\n\nUnaware\n\nCaught unaware, vehicle riders were left in the lurch and were seen hunting for stocked petrol bunks.
