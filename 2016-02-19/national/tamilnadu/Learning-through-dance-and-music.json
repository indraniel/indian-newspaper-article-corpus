Bill and Livia, co-founders of The Vanaver Caravan, a professional dance company and pioneers in Art Education Programme from United States, introduced the students to the multi-cultural music, song and dance.\n\nThey have been practising for the past two weeks to perform in Auroville on Friday. \u201cMusical instruments like Banjo, drums and 12-string guitar will be played live as the children dance,\u201d said Bill Vanaver.\n\nHe added: \u201cFrom a welcome dance from West Africa to Chinese Festival Ribbon Dance, the children will also perform South African Gumboot Dance, Brazilian Martial Art Dance - Maculele, Sicilian Tarantella Dance (Italy), Virginia Reel, American Clog Dance and Nigerian dance that describes all the planting cycle.\u201d\n\nVanaver Caravan has been working with students in US for the past 40 years and four years in North India. \u201cIt is the first time, we are teaching students here in Auroville,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least 100 students from III to VIII grade in Aikiyam School were taught history of different countries and culture through dance and music.\n\n\u201cEducation is not only providing information but it is about developing curiosity, learning to be creative, expanding the horizon and building bond with society,\u201d said Livia. She performs traditional dance and music from many cultures.\n\nShe added that the first exercise we gave the children was to question them why people dance. \u201cIt is for happiness, express joy, show talent, relax our body, to be together, to make friends, to make others happy, be united,\u201d wrote the students on a chart that was displayed in the classroom.\n\nLivia said: \u201cWe talk about why people dance and the children give us the answers. Later, we explain the history and the origin of different dance before we start practice. This introduces them to the history and culture of countries across the world.\u201d\n\nBill added: \u201cSome people call it \u2018out of textbook\u2019 learning.\u201d The dance workshop that began at 9 a.m. ended with South African Gumboot Dance performed by the eighth grade students of the school in the evening.\n\nAikiyam School principal Shankar said that students studying here hail from the economically poor families from nearby villages of Auroville like Periya Mudaliar Chavadi to Edayanchavadi. Bhargavi from Bharathi Nagar near Auroville, who is studying eighth grade, said: \u201cThis South African Gumboot Dance is a code dance.\u201d\n\nHer classmates Ajith Kumar added that it was a code dance of miners who worked in the gold and diamond mines in South Africa. The workshop has indeed been successful in teaching them history through the prism of dance forms.\n\nThe Varaven Caravan team will also conduct a workshop with the government school teachers at Junior Technical School at Lawspet on Sunday organized by the Aikiyam School in association with Azim Premji Foundation.",
