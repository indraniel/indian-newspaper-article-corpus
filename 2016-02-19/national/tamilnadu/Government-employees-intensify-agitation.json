    "text": ": A section of government employees, noon meal staff and road workers intensified their agitation on Thursday.\n\nThey changed their tactic on Thursday by resorting to a \u201cKaathiruppor Porattam\u201d (waiting agitation) demanding the government to find a solution and implement their demands. High drama prevailed at the Collectorate where they sat at the main entrance after being denied entry inside by the police.\n\nGetting wind of their plan, the police took position at the Collectorate in the morning and closed the main gate to prevent the employees from entering inside and staging their agitation.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of employees who entered the collectorate from the rear were evicted by the police causing tense moments.\n\nThe protestors, however, sat in front of the collectorate\u2019s main entrance for some hours with police personnel standing guard.\n\nTense moments prevailed again when the striking employees brought utensils to entrance in the afternoon to cook food for those indulging in the stir.\n\nThe police took away the utensils leading to a war of words. A group of government employees managed to break the cordon and gained entry into the Collectorate campus through the main entrance leading to tension.\n\nA district-level office bearer of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association claimed that revenue department officials and those working in the treasury account also participated in the strike. The employees have been demanding among others scrapping of the new pension scheme, filling up of vacancies and rectifying pay anomalies.",
