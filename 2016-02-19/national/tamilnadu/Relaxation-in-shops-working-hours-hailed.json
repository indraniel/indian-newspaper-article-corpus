Heera, who works for a major IT firm in the city, welcomes the idea.\n\n\u201cMany times I stay at work till 1 a.m. or later, and when I\u2019m going home almost nothing is open...sometimes I stop at either a 5-star hotel or a small roadside eatery for a bite. It would be nice if there was something in between...if the malls or restaurants were open, it would be very helpful not only for me, but also for everyone who works odd hours,\u201d he said.\n\nMore employment\n\nR. Srinivasan of the Tamil Nadu Hotels Association said the removal of restrictions on the number of working hours would help increase sales, bring in more employment, improve safety in cities since there would be people on the roads at all times and earn more taxes to the government.\n\n\u201cAlready in Coimbatore, shops in railway stations and bus terminuses are open 24 hours. Similarly in Madurai, restaurants are open,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nPresident of the Multiplex Association of Tamil Nadu, Abirami Ramanathan, who welcomed the move, said that in countries like Singapore and Malaysia shops were open through the night.",
