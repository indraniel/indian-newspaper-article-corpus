    "text": "A team of engineers from Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) conducted a random check on electronic voting machines (EVMs) kept in the strongroom at Pudukottai union office here on Wednesday.\n\nA three-member team carried out the first-level check ahead of the Assembly polls, reliable sources said here on Thursday. The team checked the working condition of 80 EVMs in the presence of Joint Director of Animal Husbandry S. Jayaraman, who has been deputed as supervisor, and officials of the Revenue Department. As many as 3,050 ballot units and 3,530 control units of the EVMs had already arrived from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The random checks would continue, sources said.\n\nA total of 1,559 polling booths had been set up in the district. The officials were organising camps for effecting changes in the voters\u2019 list. One such camp would be organised at the polling booths from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday (February 19).\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement issued here, Collector M. Ravikumar said that booth-level officers and booth-level agents would convene meetings, and the revised electoral roll would be handed over to the agents. The representatives of political parties were asked to collect revised electoral rolls through their agents. A list of eligible voters would be displayed at all polling booths, electoral registration offices and also on the website: www.thoothukudi.nic.in.\n\nThe voters\u2019 list would also be displayed at grama sabha meetings scheduled for February 22. Doubts with regard to the voters\u2019 list could be clarified with booth-level officers or the election cell at the Collectorate.",
