Jainulabudeen was appointed as junior assistant in December 2007 on a temporary basis. According to him, the board used to terminate employees recruited on temporary basis on completion of 89 days of service and re-appoint them the very next day to avoid regularising their service.\n\nIn view of an advertisement issued by the board in July 2015 inviting applications for 47 posts, the petitioner, who is working as Wakf Inspector, apprehended that the board would terminate his services.\n\nHowever, it orders status quo in respect of employment of petitioner",
