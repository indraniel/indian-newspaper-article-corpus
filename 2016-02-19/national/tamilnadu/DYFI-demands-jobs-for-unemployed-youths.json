In the past 10 years, appointments are made only after receiving money. They said that 20 lakh persons submit applications for 2,000 posts and the situation worsens every day. \u201cEfforts should be taken to create 10 lakh new jobs in villages so that youths are benefitted,\u201d they said.\n\nThe cadre also came down heavily on the Vision 2023 document and blamed the politicians for making false promise that they would create jobs if they came back to power.
