Senior civil engineers and Coimbatore Corporation engineers will help the students achieve the task.\n\nTo provide the financial support and materials, the agencies involved are in talks with corporate companies that may either support with cash, kind or both. For the target of 2,500 toilets, the organisers are in talks with cement companies.\n\nThey have also calculated the bricks required and are in discussion with other sponsors, the sources say.\n\nMembers of the public who want to financially support the project will be able to do so soon as the Toiletfirst.in will soon have a payment gateway.\n\nThe sources add that around 900 civil engineers through their colleges have committed to be a part of the \u2018construct-athon\u2019.\n\nThe final list of colleges, students and corporate companies with the nature of support will be made open.",
