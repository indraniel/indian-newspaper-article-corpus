All the birds were alive, S. Ganesalingam, Forest Range Officer, said.\n\nThe accused were identified as S. Arumugam (47), K. Pathamuthu (32), V. Murugan (35) and N. Munusamy (52). They hailed from MGR Nagar and Anna Nagar in Vannivayal area, he said.\n\nThe squad, comprising anti-poaching watchers K. Kumaresan, S. Rajagopal, P. Jagadalaprathapan and P. Ilayaperumal, had been visiting the waterbody for the last three days following specific inputs about poaching activities but could not spot the poachers.\n\nOn Thursday evening, they walked for nearly one and a half km along thorny bushes and caught the poachers red-handed, Mr. Kumaresan said. The poachers hunted the birds after laying nets in the waterbody.\n\nInterrogation of the accused revealed that they hunted the birds for selling them to hotels and bars, they said.\n\nMr. Ganesalingam said Deepak Bilgi, Wildlife Warden of Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, would decide whether the accused should be produced before a court or released after being fined. The birds would be released in Therthangal Bird Sanctuary after the case was decided, he said.",
