Gopalakrishnan, Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection in Chennai.\n\n\u201cIn public interest we asked the TNPDA to withdraw the strike. They have a grievance and we hope that the oil industry will be able to resolve it within 2-3 weeks time,\u201d Mr. Gopalakrishnan told The Hindu .\n\nTNPDA vice-president K. Suresh Kumar said due to 30\u2013odd LOA pumps nearly 700 outlets in the western belt were affected.\n\nV. Selvaraj, president of Sankari Lorry Owners Association, said that they had presented all papers relating to their Association to the Commissioner.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in offering discounts to our customers. The other dealers offer gifts and credit facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nOil industry sources said an industry committee would be formed to sort out the issue.\n\nMany fuel outlets in these regions had gone dry as Association members did not lift supply from the terminals",
