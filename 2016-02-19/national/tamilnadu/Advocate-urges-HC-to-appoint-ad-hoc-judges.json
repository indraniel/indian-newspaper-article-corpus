    "text": "An advocate has approached the Madras High Court with a plea to direct the court registry to create and maintain a database of retired high court judges for appointment as ad hoc judges to speed up disposal of pending cases.\n\nThe petitioner, V.B.R. Menon submitted that the judges\u2019 strength of the high court is 37, against the total sanction strength of 60 with a pending proposal to enhance the strength to 75.\n\nAsserting that the executive has to review the situation in line with the Constitution so that the objective of speedy justice could be realised, Mr. Menon said, \u201cWhen the present provisions for the appointment of judges are failing even to maintain previously determined strength of judges, it is necessary to appoint ad hoc judges under Article 224 A of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAdmitting the PIL, the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh ordered notice returnable in four weeks and appointed the Advocate General A.L. Somayaji as amicus curiae.",
