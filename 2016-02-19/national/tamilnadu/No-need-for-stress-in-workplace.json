Delegates representing local engineering and healthcare companies in Tiruchi attended the event which included lectures and personality development exercises, designed to create coping mechanisms among the participants.\n\n\u201cThough we are more aware of physical fitness these days, and have any number of gyms coming up in every city, we are less aware of mental health problems,\u201d Ms. Padmaja told The Hindu . \u201cThis is the reason why we are facing issues like a rising divorce rate, relationship stress and lack of productivity in the workplace,\u201d she added.\n\nOne\u2019s outlook about the past and future would improve vastly if one lived each moment with \u2018mindfulness\u2019, said Ms. Padmaja, who works under the banner Victory Insights. She said that very often it was the workers who chose to prioritise earning more money who were vulnerable to getting stressed. \u201cIf a couple really cares for each other\u2019s happiness, would the partners really work double shifts? I think anybody can be happy in any situation provided they are willing to take responsibility for their decision and know what to prioritise in their life,\u201d said Ms. Padmaja.\n\nVisual, auditory and kinaesthetic coping mechanisms were already in place in the pre-industrialised lifestyle, said the consultant. \u201cWe had worship routines, a more natural diet and ritual fasting which used to keep us detoxified earlier. Now this has been replaced by lifestyle changes and bizarre timings at the workplace. The inability of people to deal with ego issues leads them to feeling tortured by their spouse or boss,\u201d said Ms. Padmaja.\n\nSwarnalatha Sukumaran, who works in the staff learning and development department of a leading group of hospitals, said that attending the workshop had been very useful from a trainer\u2019s point of view. \u201cWorking in the healthcare industry can be stressful, because we are constantly dealing with intense grief, disease and death every day. Getting out of that high-stress environment is essential for healthcare workers,\u201d she said.\n\nWorkshop on stress management has become essential because the emerging generation of workers is lagging behind in both skills and emotional maturity, said V. Prakash, manager \u2013 marketing/chapters, Madras Management Association. \u201cMental health problems can lead to extreme acts of violence, which is why such issues must be constantly discussed in public,\u201d he said.",
