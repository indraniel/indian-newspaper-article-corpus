Prabakar said.\n\nThe centres at District Collectorate, Corporation Office, Bhavani Municipal Office and the four panchayat offices at Kathirampatti, Perodu, Konamulai and Elavamalai have, to a large extent, spared the people of the trouble of travelling to taluk offices and the collectorate for the certifications.",
