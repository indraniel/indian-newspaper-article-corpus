A scene from Muthialpet in Puducherry on Thursday \u2014Photo: T. Singaravelou\n\nConfusion and chaos prevailed over the distribution of freebies such as mixers and grinders at Nellithope, Muthialpet and Kamarajar Nagar on Thursday.\n\nA huge crowd with special coupons thronged the distribution centres since early morning following information that free mixers and grinders announced by the government would be given away.\n\nEven as residents, mostly women, started arriving at the venue from 4 a.m. and waited in serpentine queues for the freebies, a few persons jumped the queue, triggering chaos.\n\nThe crowd surged forward pell-mell fearing that they would miss the opportunity to get the freebies and panicked that the authorities would not entertain request on any other day.\n\nZubuyda, a resident, said, \u201cWe came here early in the morning and stood in queue from 6.a.m., but officials started the distribution only by 10 a.m. We had to stand in scorching sun for long.\u201d\n\nAt around 11 a.m., Chief Minister N.Rangasamy personally inspected the distribution centres and gave instructions to the officials to ensure smooth distribution.\n\nWith inadequate number of police personnel deployed at the centres, the officials had a tough time controlling the crowds.",
