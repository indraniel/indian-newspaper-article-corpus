    "text": "A timely financial assistance arranged by Collector M. Karunakaran has bailed out the poor residents of Zamin Ilanthaikulam in the district, whose houses were badly damaged by a tornado during the last northeast monsoon.\n\nWhen the tornado hit the sleepy village near Sankarankovil on November 17 last, the strong wind, coupled with rain, damaged around 90 houses, throwing in the air roof tiles in no time.\n\nAccompanied by Tirunelveli Revenue Divisional Officer P. Fermi Vidya, Dr. Karunakaran visited the village immediately and shifted the affected population to a nearby school and a community hall, where they stayed until their houses were repaired with the borrowings and the relief disbursed to them.\n\nThe Collector also instructed Indian Overseas Bank, the Lead Bank of the district, to assist the families by disbursing loans to them.\n\nSubsequently, Chief Regional Manager of IOB S.C. Mohanta directed the bank\u2019s Keezhaneelithalur Branch to process the request of the affected families of Zamin Ilantahikulam and arranged loans to the tune of Rs. 14.80 lakh to 74 families. In the presence of MP S. Thangavelu and Mr. Mohanta, Dr. Karunakaran distributed the loans to the affected families recently.\n\nThe Pudhu Vazhvu Project (PVP) and local bankers also organised a special loan mela for self-help groups on the occasion.",
