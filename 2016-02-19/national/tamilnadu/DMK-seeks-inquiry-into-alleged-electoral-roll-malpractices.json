    "text": "Levelling allegations against certain partymen and officials involved in the electoral roll purification process, the DMK has urged the Election Commission to conduct a detailed inquiry into the inclusion of alleged bogus voters in the rolls.\n\nIn his letter to Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni, DMK organising secretary R.S. Bharathi named some officials and alleged that they were \u201ccolluding\u201d with members of a political party and entertaining bulk applications for inclusion of bogus voters. Claiming that attempts were being made to process bulk applications, particularly in R.K. Nagar and Perambalur constituencies, he said submitting huge number of applications was not permissible.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even after the publication of voters list on January 20, more than one lakh names of dead voters were found and proposed to be deleted even as per your statement. While so, detailed inquiry shall be conducted in this regard as to on whose dereliction of duty these types of things happened in the published voters list,\u201d Mr. Bharathi said.\n\nAs regards the ongoing electoral roll purification drive, he said the place and time when the booth-level officers (BLOs) would be meeting the booth-level agents should be informed. He also requested that contacts of authorised BLOs names be uploaded on the official website.",
