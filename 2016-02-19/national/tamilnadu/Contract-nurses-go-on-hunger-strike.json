Last month too, the nurses had protested over the issue. \u201cAt that point, the government told us that those who had completed seven years of service would be regularised. However, only 400 of the 809 nurses who had completed seven years were regularised,\u201d said R. Marimuthu, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Government Contract Nurses Welfare Association.\n\nHe said that three nurses fainted and were admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.\n\nWhen the issue was raised in the Assembly on Thursday, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said the services of 450 government nurses on contract had already been regularised.",
