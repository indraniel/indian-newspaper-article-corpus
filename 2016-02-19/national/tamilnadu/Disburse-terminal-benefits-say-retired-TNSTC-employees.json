    "text": "As many as 55 retired employees of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) were arrested here on Thursday for staging a fast in front of the TNSTC depot in Ranithottam, urging the government to settle their terminal benefits, including gratuity, leave surrender and PF.\n\nThe retired employees alleged that while their counterparts in Chennai received their terminal benefits on the day of retirement, the government was indifferent to those in rural areas. Many employees who had retired five years ago were yet to get their terminal benefits. After persistent agitations in 2011-12, the authorities settled the accounts of few retired employees but still DA arrears for 22 months were yet to be disbursed, they said.\n\nThough the 55 retired employees had announced an indefinite fast in front of the TNSTC depot, they did not get permission for their agitation, police sources said. After they were arrested, the 55 men were detained in a marriage hall where they continued their fast.",
