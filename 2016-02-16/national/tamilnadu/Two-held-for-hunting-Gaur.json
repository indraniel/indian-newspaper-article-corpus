They had cut its head and hid the carcass under a bush,\u201d M. Babu, forester, Odugathur range said.\n\nIn their confession, the duo said that they were planning to remove the bison\u2019s horn and skin and sell it.\n\n\u201cWe had already created awareness among the villagers along the reserve forest area.
