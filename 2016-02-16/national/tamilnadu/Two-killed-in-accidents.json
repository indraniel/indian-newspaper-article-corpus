    "text": "In a quirk of fate, two persons, including a pre-university student, were killed in two accidents that occurred in a span of one hour at Kogilu Cross in Yelahanka on Saturday.\n\nIn the first accident reported around 8 p.m., Yusuf (18), a student of Seshadripuram College, was killed when a lorry ran over him near Kogilu Cross. The police said Yusuf, a resident of R.T. Nagar, was returning home on his motorbike after visiting a friend and lost control over the vehicle when he reached Kogilu Cross. He slipped from the vehicle and went under the wheels of a lorry which was coming from the opposite direction.\n\nA 25-year-old businessman was killed on the same spot after a speeding lorry knocked him down an hour later.\n\nThe deceased, Sriram, a resident of Kogilu, was returning home from work. The lorry driver was allegedly drunk and was over speeding, the police said.\n\nTension prevailed in the area for sometime after the public set the lorry on fire.",
