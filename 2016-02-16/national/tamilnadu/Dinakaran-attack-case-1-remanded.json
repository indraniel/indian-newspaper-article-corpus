Saravanamuthu alias \u2018Sirpi\u2019 Saravanan, one of the 12 accused against whom non-bailable arrest warrants were issued in the 2007 Dinakaran newspaper office attack case.\n\nThe warrants were issued for not cooperating in disposing of an appeal preferred by the CBI in 2010 against the acquittal of 17 accused.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices A. Selvam and G. Chockalingam passed the order after CBI officials executed the arrest warrant with respect to him alone and produced him in court. He was arrested from Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram district where he was eking out a living by sculpting statues which gave him the Tamil sobriquet \u2018Sirpi\u2019.",
