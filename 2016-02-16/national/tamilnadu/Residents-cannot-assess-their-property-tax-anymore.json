    "text": "The Greater Chennai Corporation has suspended the system of allowing residents to assess their own property tax, claiming that many residents have failed to provide the right dimensions of their properties for assessment of tax.\n\nResidents who tried to carry out a self-assessment of property tax online have not received the services for the past few days. Due to the suspension, tax assessment orders are likely to be issued only after field inspection of the property is completed.\n\nThe Council passed a resolution last year and started self-assessment of property tax, facilitating tax payment within a few minutes of submitting the request.\n\nMore than 8000 buildings have been included in the property tax net through self-assessment so far. Residents of all the zones were able to calculate on their own the property tax they need to pay to the Chennai Corporation, without meeting government officials. The data collected by residents with the help from licensed surveyors to measure their homes and commercial buildings was fed online for self-assessment. But Corporation officials claimed that much of the data was wrong.\n\nProperty owners were able to get assessment orders on the same day of submission. The Corporation also accepted payment of property tax immediately. Residents who used the services said they were able to use the certificate to apply for power and water supply connections quickly.\n\nThere used to be a delay of several months in assessment of property tax. At least 6,000 buildings were assessed after six months of submission in 2014. According to civic body officials, properties that had completed self-assessment were randomly selected for cross-verification by officials.",
