    "text": "Key roads within the Tiruvallur Municipality, especially around the ancient Veeraraghava temple, will be made out of bounds for vehicles that come from Chennai via Red Hills until the end of March to facilitate work on the final phase of the ongoing Rs. 54.79-crore Underground Drainage (UGD) project in the town. Work began a few days ago. The restrictions were put in place on Monday.\n\nTiruvallur district officials said that an order to this effect had been issued by the district administration to the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD), the executing agency of the multi-crore project for the municipality, and the traffic police.\n\nDistrict officials waited for the completion of the consecration programme at the Veeraraghava temple, which was attended by thousands last week, to effect traffic diversion.\n\nCurrently, trials, including those for the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), are being conducted.\n\n\u201cApplications for the new sewer connections are being received by the Municipality from consumers in the completed areas,\u201d said N. Vishwanathan, Commissioner, Tiruvallur Municipality .\n\nAs per the new plan, vehicles that mainly come from Red Hills have to take Jawarharlal Nehru Main Road in Kakkalur to reach the bus terminus near the temple to proceed further to other areas, including those in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, rather than take the existing route, via East Kulakarai Street and Bazaar Street.\n\nLikewise, vehicles that head to Tirutani and beyond via Tiruvallur have to take Rajaji Street and Kamaraj Street in the town.",
