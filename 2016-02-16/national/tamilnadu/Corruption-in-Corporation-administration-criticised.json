    "text": "Members of CPI (M), VCK, MDMK and CPI accused the Corporation administration of corruption and lethargy that made the life of city residents miserable in the last four years.\n\nProtesting near Corporation office, the representatives of the four parties alleged that almost half of the Rs 500 crore earmarked for implementation of various development works since 2011 had gone towards \u2018commissions\u2019.\n\n\u201cAIADMK councillors too have raised the issue of improper implementation of projects on various occasions. One AIADMK councillor even attempted self immolation to express displeasure over the lackadaisical attitude of the administration when it came to improving basic facilities in wards\u201d, said M. Subramanian, the CPI district secretary. The agitators came down heavily on the Corporation officials for not listening to the grievances of people about the impure drinking water being supplied in many areas. They wanted an inquiry to unearth the illegal tapping of water from the main supply line at many places.\n\nThere were a large number of street lights that remained non-functional across the city and the Corporation administration was doing little to replace the same. Mosquito control measures were far from satisfactory, they said.",
