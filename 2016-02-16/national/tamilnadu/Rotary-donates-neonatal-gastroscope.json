The bulk of these services benefit patients from underprivileged families in the city and adjoining districts of Tamil Nadu such as Villupuram, Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai. However, the limitations in the infrastructure of paediatric endoscopic services in Jipmer were partly because of the size of the available endoscope. The donation of a neonatal gastroscope from Rotary would facilitate extending for newborns and young children endoscopy for diarrhoea or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, a press note said.\n\nS.C. Parija, director, Jipmer, received the equipment from Judith Henderson, Project Primary Contact, Australia, and president of Rotary Pondicherry Eves, Madhavi Suresh.\n\nJ. Balachander, Medical Superintendent, Mahadevan, Dean of Jipmer, and Rotarians Gunasekaran, Alphonse Ligouri, Gunasekar and Sendamarre Cannane participated. The donation was coordinated by Jipmer\u2019s Medical Social worker Chitrakala Karun, the press note said.",
