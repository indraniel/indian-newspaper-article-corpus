Raghupathy (38) of Tiruttani, who was employed as a loadman at Chennai Central some years ago. Police said Raghupathy would get into the unreserved compartments with his accomplices R. Subramani (66) and his son S. Sakthivel (30), at Tiruttani and Tiruvallur stations.\n\nUtilising his expertise in opening the doors of parcel vans from his earlier stint as loadman, Raghupathy would enter the van and throw out the consignment from the moving train.\n\nThe three of them would get down from the train at its next halt, pick up the appliances and sell them to Bhaskar, who runs a store in Tiruttani.\n\nBhaskar, who has also been arrested, would then sell the household appliances and all of them would share the money, police sources added.\n\nTheir associate, a trader in Tiruttani who would sell the goods was held",
