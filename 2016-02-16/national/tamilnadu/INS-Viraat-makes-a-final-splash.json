    "text": "The carrier was inducted into the Indian Navy in 1987\n\nIn what is probably her last port of call, INS Viraat, the oldest operational aircraft carrier in the world, dropped anchor in Chennai on Monday.\n\nCommissioned as HMS Hermes as part of the Royal Navy, she was in the thick of action during the Falklands campaign in 1982.\n\nAfter serving the United Kingdom for almost 28 years since 1959, the carrier was inducted into the Indian Navy as INS Viraat in 1987.\n\n\u201cWe are on our way back from the International Fleet Review which concluded at Visakhpatnam. After leaving Chennai, INS Viraat would go to Mumbai, her home port. She is expected to be decommissioned by the end of this year,\u201d said Captain Puneet Chadha, commanding officer of the ship which has on board Sea Harriers, Sea King 42B and Chetak helicopters.\n\nRecalling his long service with the vessel, veteran sailor Terendra P. Singh, a Master Chief Marine Engineer I Class, said: \u201cIt has been my home for 23 years and I have had great experiences in this ship.\u201d\n\nSoon after joining the Navy in 1985, Mr. Singh was part of the team that was sent to the United Kingdom for training, and when the aircraft carrier was inducted into the Indian Navy in May 1987, he was part of the commissioning crew.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports that the Andhra Pradesh government is making efforts to convert the 227-metre-long vessel into a museum.",
