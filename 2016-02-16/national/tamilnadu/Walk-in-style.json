    "text": "The new Walkers Track near VOC Stadium, a much anticipated facility by morning and evening walkers, has been opened up for citizens\u2019 use. Inaugurating the facility, Environment Minister Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam, urged the users to plant saplings on open spaces on the compound and maintain them.\n\nThe walk track created to a length of 300 metres with 7.8 metre width at a cost of Rs. 30 lakh obviates the need for the walkers to depend on the stadium anymore.\n\nHalf of the project cost was sourced from the constituency development fund of S. Selvakumara Chinnaiyan, MP.\n\nThe Canara Bank provided Rs. 7.5 lakh and the rest was funding out of self sufficiency scheme.\n\nInitially, the project cost was estimated to be Rs. 18 lakh, of which the VOC Walkers\u2019 Welfare Association contributed Rs. 5 lakh. Subsequently, more funds had to be mobilised for construction of compound wall.\n\nThe walkers\u2019 track has layers of water bound macadem, brick jelly and sand-gravel mix, concrete slabs on the sides, and fencing. Urinals for men and women have also been constructed.\n\nThe location, earlier a lorry shed, has witnessed the transformation owing to the interest evinced by the Collector and the MP.\n\nThe association members have been using a portion of the VOC Stadium for their daily walks.\n\nBut, the entry to the stadium will get restricted during conduct of major sports events, and on rainy days.\n\nThe association has been sounded of its responsibility to appoint watchman and undertake maintenance.",
