After he got a job in Chandigarh University, his father Srinivasan moved there, and that\u2019s where Judge Srikanth Srinivasan was born. Later, in the 60, Professor Srinivasan moved to the University of Kansas with his family.\n\nThough he has not visited the sleepy hamlet, situated about 6 km from Tirunelveli Town, the villagers are naturally keen to see him as the Judge of Supreme Court of America.",
