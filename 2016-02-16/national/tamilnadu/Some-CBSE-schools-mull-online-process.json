This will put in place an easier process for parents,\u201d he said, adding that besides promoting efficiency, this process would also usher in greater transparency.\n\nThe Bhavan\u2019s Rajaji Vidyashram, which started offering admission forms online nearly six years ago, has had around 1,400 applicants on their website this year during the admission season.\n\n\u201cThere has been a 10 per cent increase in the number of applications received online, when compared to last year and the parents are extremely happy which is why we want to introduce a common platform,\u201d he explained.\n\nMany CBSE schools have, this year, begun to offer the option to parents of downloading the application forms and submitting them in person or through post.\n\n\u201cThis has definitely made it less stressful for parents. This year, we\u2019ve received 50 per cent of the applications online and the rest directly on the school premises,\u201d said Padmini Sriraman, principal of Hindu Senior Secondary School, which introduced the online option for parents two years ago.\n\nParents and activists, who have long been voicing the need for regulations in the admission process, said that making it mandatory for schools to offer an online option for admissions was the need of the hour.\n\nAravind, a resident of the city who had submitted an online application for his nephew at a CBSE school in Nanganallur, said that the process was a hassle-free one. \u201cHowever, there were limited seats available for LKG and the admissions too were quickly stopped as the school had received a large number of applications. A more streamlined process online would be of great help,\u201d he said.\n\nParents, activists voice the need for mandatory online option for all CBSE schools in city",
