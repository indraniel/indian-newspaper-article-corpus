On such occasions, the road users have to use the circuitous route of a passing through Thermal Bridge.\n\nThe AIADMK cadre distributed sweets to the passersby as soon as the Chief Minister opened the bridge.\n\nAnother major high-level bridge declared open was the one across River Cauvery connecting the villages of Mohanur (Namakkal district) and Vangal (Karur district) at an outlay of Rs. 43.5 crore.\n\nThe State Government accorded sanction for this project in 2008 and the construction work commenced in 2009. The bridge is to a length of 1.5 km and has 56 decks.
