    "text": "A 23-year-old man died and four of his family members were critically injured in a blast triggered by leaking LPG in their home at Hebbagodi on Sunday.\n\nWhile Ambarish was charred to death on the spot, his elder sister Ansuyamma and her husband Mallesh sustained third degree burns and are said to be critical. Their two children, Harish (18) and Suresh (12), who also sustained injuries in the blast, are responding to treatment, police officials said.\n\nThe house owner, Renukamma, who was living next door, also sustained injuries when parts of her house collapsed following the blast. A third house developed cracks owing to the impact of the blast, Fire Services officials said. The incident occurred on Sunday around 5.15 a.m., when Ambarish, who used to work in a private firm and was living with his sister\u2019s family, went to the kitchen to make tea. Police, and Fire and Emergency Services officials suspect that gas from the cylinder could have been leaking all night. Ambarish, who did not realise this, is suspected to have switched on the light or struck a match, trigging the blast. \u201cThe fire did not spread to the nearby houses as there were no inflammable materials around. By the time we reached the spot, most of the fire was put out and the family members were rescued by other residents and rushed to Victoria Hospital,\u201d a Fire Services official said.\n\nThe house owner, Renukamma, who was living next door, also sustained injuries",
