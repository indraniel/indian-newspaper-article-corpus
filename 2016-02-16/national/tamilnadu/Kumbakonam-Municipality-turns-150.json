For this to remain etched in the memory of the visiting pilgrims, the municipality has carried out numerous development work to the tune of Rs. 50 crore,\u201d said chairperson Rathna Sekar.\n\nSpecial arrangements have been made for augmenting water supply facilities in the town at a cost of Rs. 2.44 crore in creating three new infiltration wells, installing two 180 HP turbines and provisioning for non-infrastructure work such as engaging tankers and trucks for water supply on rental basis during the festival period.\n\nWhile street lighting has been upgraded by spending Rs. 5.40 crore for installing 500 LED street lights, 20 mini high mast lamps and two high mast lamps, solid waste management work including complete renovation of the Thepperumanallur compost yard through the bio-mining concept have been implemented in the run up to the Mahamaham festival at a cost of Rs. 11.17 crore.\n\nIn the bio-mining work, 18,000 cubic metre of the 1.31 lakh cubic metres of assessed garbage has been processed and cleared.\n\nThe town roads underwent extensive face lift with Rs. 1.58 crore sanctioned for improving temple car routes, another Rs. 1.88 crore for providing interlock blocking arrangements for sanitary lanes while restoration of 121 stretches of bitumen topped surface and cement concrete roads were completed at a cost of Rs. 10.76 crore.\n\nThe municipality is also carrying out restoration works including dredging, providing rain water harvesting and walk ways around six tanks within the civic body boundaries at a cost of Rs. 3.60 crore in view of the Mahamaham.\n\nThe tanks getting a new lease of life include Pachaiyappan tank.
