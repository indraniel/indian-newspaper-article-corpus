    "text": "A large number of people from Avinashi, Perumanallur, Cheyur and nearby areas came to the District Collectorate on Monday to surrender their ration cards as a mark of protest against the inordinate delay in implementing the Athikadavu- Avinashi Groundwater Recharge Scheme. However, the revenue officials refused to accept the cards.\n\nFollowing this, the activists who had been agitating for speedy implementation of the Scheme decided to intensify the struggle from Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are worried as the scheme was conceptualised more than 50 years ago and almost all political parties made pre-poll promises of implementing the same for the past many decades. However, the project never took off\u201d, T. Sathyamoorthy, a lawyer-activist who had been in the struggle to see the project takes off, told reporters.\n\nFast\n\nMeanwhile, the fast observed by 14 activists in support of the scheme continued for the eighth day at Avinashi on Monday.",
