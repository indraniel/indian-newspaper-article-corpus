    "text": "Clear garbage\n\nGarbage collected in tricycles from nearby areas is dumped at the junction of Santhai Road and George Road In Thoothukudi. Earlier, the dumped garbage used to be cleared then and there or in one or two days by lorries. But for the past three months the Corporation authorities are not taking enough care in disposing of the dumped garbage immediately for reasons not known.\n\nAt present, it is disposed of once a week but sometimes it remains there for ten or more days.\n\nThis poses a health hazard to the public.\n\nThe stench emanating from the waste is obnoxious and unbearable. Cattle and stray dogs scavenging the garbage spread it to the middle of the road which causes inconvenience to pedestrians.\n\nI request the authorities to take suitable steps to clear it without delay.\n\nV. Pandy,\n\nTuticorin.\n\nOBC certificate\n\nBackward Class (BC) certificate is required for getting concessions from the State government.\n\nOther Backward Class (OBC) certificate is issued for obtaining concessions from the Central government.\n\nIt is ascertained from the Revenue department that the OBC certificate is valid for one year only.\n\nThe BC certificate is a permanent document whereas the OBC certificates is a temporary one.\n\nThere is no justification in this contradiction.\n\nThe community or caste is not going to change year to year. Moreover, it is not easy to get such certificates from the Revenue department. Hence, I request the Tamil Nadu government to make the OBC certificate a permanent document like the BC certificate.\n\nG. Nagasamy,\n\nRamanathapuram.",
