    "text": "There was a ruckus over signing of register at the council meet here on Monday.\n\nIt all began when ward 18 councillor Jayanthi of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) signed the register and went out of the hall before the commencement of the meeting as she was not well. While a town panchayat official was getting signatures from other councillors at the meeting, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(DMK) councillor Duraipandi tore the register in protest against obtaining signature from councillors without discussing the subject.\n\nCondemning his action, council vice-president Peer Mohamad (AIADMK), threw a water bottle in the podium and shouted in the hall. He stated that the councillor did not have the right to tear the register, an official record. They had a heated argument.\n\nMr. Duraipandi complained that no AIAMDK councillor came to the meeting but still signed the register. How could an official obtain signature without discussing anything, he questioned. Later, all resolutions were passed by the council.",
