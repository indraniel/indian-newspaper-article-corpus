Murugesan, General Secretary of the Coordination Committee, said that thousands of employees associated with 816 cooperative housing societies, were not paid salaries for the last four years. \u201cWe request the government to immediately release the pending salary of Rs. 46 crore,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the cooperative housing societies, which lent loans amounting to Rs. 4,753 crore to families with middle and poor income over the years, have lost their revenue as they were not in a position to sanction fresh loans for the past 10 years.\n\nThe associations demanded that as no new loans were being sanctioned, the excess employees in the cooperative housing societies be transferred to cooperative banks in the existing vacancies.\n\nThey also demanded that the huge losses incurred by the cooperative housing societies owing to loan waivers announced since 2003 be compensated fully by the Tamil Nadu government.\n\n\u201cThe government should also consider implementing the union government\u2019s \u201cHousing for All\u201d scheme through the cooperative societies so that the societies can sustain themselves,\u201d Mr. Murugesan said.\n\nThe protesters were detained and later released by the Madurai City police.",
