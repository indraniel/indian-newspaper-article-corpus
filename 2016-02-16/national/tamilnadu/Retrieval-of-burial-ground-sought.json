Chavan at the weekly grievances day meeting in this regard.\n\nIn their petition, they said that they used a small piece of land adjacent to the Vatsankulam pond for the last four decades as burial ground for their community. But the people who had moved to the recently developed layout near the pond were not allowing bodies from Arunthathiar community to be buried in the said land.",
