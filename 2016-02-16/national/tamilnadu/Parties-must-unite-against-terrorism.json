    "text": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s voluntary meeting with Afsal Guru and Yakob Memon mirrored its tacit support to terrorism, said Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. Ganesan.\n\nTalking press persons here on Monday, he said that several foreign countries that had differences of opinion on various issues allied together against anti-terrorists activities. But Leftists and the Congress, with an aim of acting against the PM, took supportive stand on terrorists.\n\nComments made by the DMDK leader Premalatha against DMK alliance with Congress indicated that the DMDK would not have alliance with the DMK in the Assembly election. The DMDK did not join hands with the DMK because the Congress was with it. Congress leader E.V.K.S Elangovan should realise it, he said.\n\nParty leader Amit Sha would make an announcement about alliance in the State in five days. But the State BJP commenced its field work in all 234 constituencies. The weak TN Election Commission could not prevent distribution of money for votes. It had several hurdles in executing its work. The \u2018Tirumangalam formula\u2019 had become \u2018Tamil Nadu formula.\u2019 People should come forward voluntarily not to accept money for casting their votes, he said.\n\nOn People\u2019s Welfare Front, he said that it was formed just for the campaign.",
