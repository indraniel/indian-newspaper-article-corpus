    "text": "The Madras High Court on Monday granted three months time to the State government to file its response to the 600-page report filed by the court-appointed legal commissioner U. Sagayam on illegal granite quarrying.\n\nThe First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh said, \u201cWhat we require from the State government is an analysis of the report, steps taken in pursuance to the report and further steps contemplated, so that the report is taken to its logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nIn this context, the entrustment of further investigation to any other agency would also be examined, said the Bench while hearing the PIL petition moved by Traffic' K.R. Ramaswamy.\n\nThe Bench then posted the matter to March 31 for further hearing.\n\nOn November 23, Mr. Sagayam, after concluding his year long investigation into the issue, submitted the report along with an annexure running to over 7,000 pages. The report stated that the State had suffered a loss of about Rs. one lakh crore due to illegal mining of granite in Madurai district alone.",
