    "text": "In what is probably the last session of the current Legislative Assembly before the State goes to the elections this summer, the interim budget for the year 2016-17 will be presented on Tuesday.\n\nThis is also the session which is commencing after the suspension of six DMDK MLAs was set aside by the Supreme Court on Friday. The six legislators \u2013 V.C. Chandrakumar, R. Mohanraj, S.R. Parthiban, L. Venkatesan, C.H. Sekar and K. Thinakaran \u2014 were suspended from the State Assembly last year for allegedly breaching the privilege of the House.\n\nAs they did not get call letters asking them to attend the session, the six MLAs on Monday submitted a letter to the Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Assembly reminding him about the SC order and asking that their rights be restored.\n\nIn a joint letter addressed to the Assembly secretary, the MLAs said that their day-to-day affairs as elected members of the Assembly were curtailed. If he (Assembly secretary) hesitates to take necessary steps to comply with the judgment, the MLAs said they would be forced to move a contempt petition against him in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe MLAs were suspended following a ruckus in the Assembly in February 2015.\n\nThe DMDK had a total of 29 MLAs of which one resigned and eight have expressed their support to the ruling AIADMK.",
