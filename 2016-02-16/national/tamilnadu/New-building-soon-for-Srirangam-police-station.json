    "text": "The police station at Srirangam, built about six decades ago, is being demolished to give way for a new building. The old building lacks adequate space, forcing the traffic wing to be shifted to a still more cramped area on the Grand Southern Trunk Road in Tiruvanaikovil.\n\nHence, the Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation decided to demolish the old building for construction of a new building at an estimate of Rs. 1.40 crore.\n\nThe station has been temporarily shifted to Mambala Salai and the process of demolition is expected to be completed within a week\u2019s time.\n\nThe two-storey building will have state-of-the-art facilities. The Law and Order unit will be accommodated on the ground floor, Crime unit on the first floor and the traffic wing on the second floor.\n\nSeparate facility for men and women personnel would be provided. Once the new building is constructed, the traffic wing will be shifted from Tiruvanaikovil and accommodated here.\n\nThe plinth area will be 6,000 square feet \u2013 2,000 square feet each on the ground floor, first floor and second floor.",
