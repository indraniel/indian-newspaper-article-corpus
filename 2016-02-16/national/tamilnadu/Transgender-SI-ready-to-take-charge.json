    "text": "K. Prithika Yashini (25), a transgender whose application was initially rejected by the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) over her gender choice, has received the appointment order as Sub-Inspector of police here on Monday.\n\nShe is one of the 22 persons, including five women, who received their appointment orders from City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan here.\n\nWhen the TNUSRB invited applications to fill 1,087 SI posts last year, her application was rejected stating that she did not fall under the available two categories of gender.\n\nShe moved the Madras High Court and was allowed to take the written test, physical endurance test and viva-voce.\n\nHer long legal battle finally succeeded with the First Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana passing orders in November, 2015 that enabled her to be recruited as SI, though she missed the 100 metre dash by a second.\n\nAddressing the media here on Monday, she said her journey was very difficult. Expressing happiness over being the country\u2019s first transgender Sub-Inspector, she vowed to fight against foeticide and prevent crime against women apart from stressing for reservation for transgenders in education and jobs. \u201cMy aim is to become an IPS officer,\u201d she said.",
