Singaravelou\n\nHead load workers owing allegiance to various trade unions staged a demonstration near the Legislative Assembly here on Monday demanding pension and establishment of a welfare board for them.\n\nThe workers led by T. Murugan, honorary president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) took out a rally from Jawaharlal Nehru Street to the Legislative Assembly. However, they were blocked by the police enroute following which they staged a sit-in near the Legislative Assembly.\n\nWelfare board promised\n\nMr. Murugan said the Government had promised during the elections that a welfare board would be set up for head load workers in the Union Territory for implementation of welfare schemes.\n\nHowever, nothing had been done so far. Head load workers are also not entitled to benefits such as housing, employment, wage regulation and medical assistance under the ESI.\n\nThe welfare board should be created on the model of Kerala to extend social security and welfare assistance to the workers and their kin. The agitators wanted pension and insurance coverage against accidents and death.",
