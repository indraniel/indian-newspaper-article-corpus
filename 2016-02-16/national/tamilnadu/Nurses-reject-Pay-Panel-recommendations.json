Singaravelou\n\nNursing staff attached to Government Hospitals in Puducherry and the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) on Monday observed a token fast in front of the head post office here protesting the \u201cretrograde recommendations\u201d of the Seventh Pay Commission.\n\nA spokesperson of the Jipmer Nurses Development Welfare Association said that the Commission had failed to recommend many of the demands made by nursing associations across the country.\n\nOne of the important demands was to step up the grade pay for nurses in view of the nature of work and the importance of nurses in the healthcare system. However, the Commission has neglected the views of the associations, protesters said.\n\nThe Commission has recommended ntry level qualification for nurses as B.Sc nursing or diploma in nursing with two years of experience. But it has failed to increase the grade pay from Rs. 4800 a month. The government should ensure safety and security of nurses in government hospitals. Risk allowances should be increased as nurses had to attend HIV and TB patients.\n\nThe agitators also wanted gazetted holidays to be extended to them like other Central government employees. They also sought night duty allowance and time-bound promotions for all nurses. The association has also demanded enhancement of nursing allowance, uniform and washing allowance, full salary during Child Care Leave.",
