But many years later, facilities like the commercial complex and primary health centre in the TNHB layout are either unoccupied or in ruins.\n\nSocial activist Babu Ganesh said the building for a primary health centre for families of the TNHB layout was constructed in 1993. The building has been vacant for more than 20 years and is now crumbling. Residents here said they sought an explanation from Avadi Municipality for not opening the health centre located on TNHB Colony 3rd Main Road, but they never received a convincing response.\n\nResidents complained that with no one occupying the vacant building, the place had now become home to reptiles. The residents of the locality also noted that the commercial complex has a public library functioning out of a small portion, while the community hall continues to be vacant and neglected.\n\nFacility built in TNHB housing colony layout in Avadi has become a haunt for reptiles",
