    "text": "The Congress-DMK alliance is a doomed alliance that will be rejected by the people of the State in the Assembly elections, said S. Sudhakar Reddy, All India General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, here on Monday.\n\nAfter opening a new party office here at Denkanikottai, the CPI leader said the alliance was headed to a defeat.\n\nCommenting on the prospects for BJP, Mr. Reddy said the party was facing a decline in its popularity and the recent poll debacle in Bihar, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh was illustrative of this decline. Any party that allied with the BJP is sure to meet defeat. As far as Makkal Nala Kootani was concerned, the Front was born of people\u2019s disillusionment with the two main political parties in the State. \u201cThere was an overwhelming support to the Front amidst people and this support is steadily increasingly,\u201d said Mr. Reddy.",
