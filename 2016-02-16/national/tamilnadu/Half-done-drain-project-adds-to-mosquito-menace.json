Gopalakrishnan\n\nDue to lack of deepening and expansion work, an uncompleted stormwater drain on the major thoroughfare in Chengalpattu has become a breeding space for mosquitoes.\n\nThe officials took up deepening and widening of the drain two months ago, when the region witnessed heavy downpour, with the objective of clearing the waterlogging on Grand Southern Trunk Road.\n\nHowever, enquiries reveal that the work was stalled halfway as the Revenue, Municipal and State Highways departments were not clear about which department should shoulder the responsibility of constructing the drain.\n\nThough the ad-hoc measure taken to deepen and widen the drain as part of flood damage control helped motorists negotiate flooded roads in the subsequent days, the floodwater mixed with garbage and slush stagnated in the deepened drain later and turned it into a breeding ground for mosquitoes, said traders in the area.\n\nExpedite the work\n\nClaiming that the situation remained the same even after two months, the president of Chengalpattu Traders Association, E. Subramanian has urged the officials to expedite the work of constructing a new stormwater drain to alleviate the health and other problems faced by the traders and public.",
