    "text": "Samathuva Makkal Katchi leader Sarath Kumar has said that all political parties must independently contest the Assembly election in Tamil Nadu.\n\nAddressing reporters on the sidelines of the \u2018meet the people programme in Ooty and Gudalur in The Nilgiris on Monday, he said that he considered his party to be a part of the AIADMK coalition but it was for the latter to clarify if his party was in the alliance. Political parties should explain their plans and programmes to the people and seek votes without being part of any coalition.\n\nThat would be the real democracy. Comprising ideologies and programmes for coalition tantamount to cheating people, he said. As for his party, the party members had authorised the leadership to decide on alliance. He would take a call in the next few days and formally announce the decision in the next 10 days.\n\nMr. Sarath Kumar said all leaders of the constituent parties in the Makkal Nala Kootani were chief minister aspirants and accused the parties of comprising ideologies to forge an electoral front.\n\nIn response to a question, he said that the AIADMK government had fulfilled all its promises and therefore there was nothing wrong in advertising its achievements.\n\nPolitical parties should explain their plans and seek votes without being part of any coalition",
