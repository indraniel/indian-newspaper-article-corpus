But the management of the sugar mill has defaulted on payment of principal and interest component on the loan.\n\nNow, the Government is making a move to divert Rs. 20 crore from the corpus fund of the PDL for other welfare programmes. The PDL is the only profit making PSU in the UT. But continuous diversion of funds and overstaffing with unqualified people could make it sick leaving the employees in the lurch, he said.\n\nTension mounted after a section of the striking employees\u2019 gheraoed the Managing Director S. Mohandas in his chamber on Monday protesting against the move.\n\nSenior police and revenue officials who held talks with them assured that the funds would be returned back to the corpus before April.",
