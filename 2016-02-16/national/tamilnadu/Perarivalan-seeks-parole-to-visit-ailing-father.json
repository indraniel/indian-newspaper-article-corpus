Perarivalan, one of the life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has sought parole to visit his ailing father.\n\nAccording to his mother, Arputhammal, this is the first time that her son was seeking parole since his imprisonment in 1991. Her husband Gnanasekaran (74) was suffering from different ailments, including hypertension and asthma, and doctors had advised that he be taken from Jolarpet to Chennai for further treatment.\n\nSince Perarivalan has to come and take his father to the hospital, he had sought release on parole.\n\nArputhammal hoped that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa would exercise constitutional provisions and order the release of her son at the earliest.",
