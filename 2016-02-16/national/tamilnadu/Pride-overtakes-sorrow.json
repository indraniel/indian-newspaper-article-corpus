    "text": "Despite a heavy heart of having lost his younger son, middle-aged K. Ganapathy of Chokkathevanpatti, takes pride in his ward, Ganesan (25), having laid down his life in the cause of the nation.\n\n\u201cI feel proud that my son has laid down his life in the call of duty for the country,\u201d Mr. Ganapathy told reporters, unable to control sobbing at the Madurai airport, where scores of villagers had gathered to receive the mortal remains of the martyr on Monday night. The bodies of Sepoy Ganesan and Lance Naik, Kumar were being brought by an army aircraft from New Delhi.\n\nRecalling how his son joined the 19th Battalion of Madras Regiment, Mr. Ganapathy said that he had been visiting home periodically even while serving in different places. \u201cOnly on Tuesday (a day before the avalanche) he called me. He hurriedly tried to complete the conversation. But I made him talk to his mother. He said that he was busy and promised to call me the next afternoon. But I came to know about the accident through television news,\u201d Mr. Ganapathy said while recounting the tragic incident.\n\nHe tried to contact him and his officers for getting details in vain. That night was the longest one for him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep the whole night without any news about my son,\u201d he said. His fear came true when he received a call revealing that his son was also part of the team that was trapped under the snow. \u201cFor three days they kept in touch with me. I thought my son would somehow call me, but it did not happen.\u201d\n\nHe wanted the State and the Centre to provide a job to his elder son.",
