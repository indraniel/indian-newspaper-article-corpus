Jayachandran said that the decision was taken at the \u201cwaiting till obtaining title deeds protest\u201d organised by them at the TNHB office in Tatabad, on Monday.\n\nMore than 300 TNHB allottees took part in the protest to condemn the alleged fleecing behind rate fixation for their house sites.\n\nMr. Jayachandran said that in 2013 the TNHB fixed the rate of a cent at Rs. 17,000, according to which the allottees should pay Rs. 2.86 lakh per ground \u2013 that includes interest for the land from January 1989.\n\n\u201cLater the land rate was reduced to Rs. 6,000 per cent \u2013 as finalised with the former land owners,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed that contrarily the housing board has asked the allottees to pay Rs. 5.34 lakh per ground, despite the more than 60 per cent drop in the actual price fixed for the land.\n\nThe protest was withdrawn after the Superintending Engineer of TNHB V. Kandhasamy assured to make a representation on the cause to authorities concerned, in Chennai.\n\nWith this forwarded representation the allottees are planning to meet petition the Chief Minister and top TNHB official, with hope of working out a logical price for the land and put an end to the struggle for title deed for more than 20 years.\n\nThey seek title deeds for the house sites allotted to them on the 65.32 acres at Ganapathy Maa Nagar in the mid 1990s",
