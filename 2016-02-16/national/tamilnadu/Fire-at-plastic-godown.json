According to sources, the fire spread farther after the water pumping motor of the fire service vehicle faced a glitch. The delay had caused the fire to rage causing extensive damage. After a three \u2013hour long battle, the fire was extinguished. The loss of the damaged plastic was estimated around Rs. 50 lakh and cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained.",
