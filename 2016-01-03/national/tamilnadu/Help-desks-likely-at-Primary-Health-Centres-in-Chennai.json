Through them, they can find out where to get treatment, learn about preventive measures for diseases and clear any doubts they may have,\u201d he said.\n\nThis proposal was discussed at a meeting held on Saturday, to review the situation on dengue in the city. In 2015, the official said, Chennai had 287 cases of dengue.\n\n\u201cThis is lower than the 2012 figure, and our focus now is to intensify preventive measures,\u201d he said.\n\nSource reduction will be focused on, and the civic body is also going to gear up IEC (information, education and communication) measures to create awareness among residents, he said.",
