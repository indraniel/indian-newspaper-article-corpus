In a fit of rage, the men drew out sharp weapons, and hacked him to death.\n\nAs they tried to escape, Devaraj, a 50-year-old auto driver, attempted to overpower them.\n\nBut the assailants injured him and escaped. Mr. Devaraj was admitted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) for treatment.\n\nOn hearing about the murder, the Ayanavaram police rushed to the spot and sent the body of Arivazhagan to KMCH for a post-mortem.\n\nThe police suspect the involvement of Logu, a local gangster, in the murder due to previous enmity.\n\nFurther investigations are on.",
