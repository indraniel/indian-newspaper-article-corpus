    "text": "The prevalence of diabetes among 500 organised and unorganised workers in Tuticorin block is 23 per cent and 10 per cent of these two working sectors are pre-diabetic, A. Sankar, president, Empower, Diabetes Prevention and Education Centre, said here on Friday.\n\nIn a baseline study undertaken by this centre, these workers aged 30 years and above were screened at 10 work sites in this block in a random method.\n\nAmong the working classes, transport workers had high rate of diabetes. He told The Hindu that 16 percent of 82 transport workers, who were screened, were diagnosed with diabetes. Fisher folks stood next with 14 percent as 68 fishermen had been living with diabetes. With 68 salt workers screened, 13 percent of them were diabetic. Among 54 hotel workers, 11 percent of them were running the risk of diabetes and ten percent of 58 workers in shipping companies also faced a similar risk. After checking 37 traders, 30 tailors, 30 washermen, 30 workers in manufacturing industries, 27 carpenters and 29 goldsmiths, five to seven percent of each of these working categories were diabetic.\n\nThe observations were made based on parameters including food intake pattern, physical activity, body mass index, level of glucose and blood pressure. Among the diabetic patients, 74 percent of them had rice all three times a day and only 21 percent of the workers were on regular exercise, he said.",
