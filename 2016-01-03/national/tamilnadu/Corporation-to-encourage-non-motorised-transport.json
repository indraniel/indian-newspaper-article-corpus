VELANKANNI RAJ\n\nIn an effort to provide thrust on non-motorised transport, the Tiruchirapalli City Corporation plans to create pavements and bicycle tracks along a few more important roads in the city.\n\nThe proposed plan is in addition to the ongoing project of laying pavement and bicycle track along Race Course, Anna Nagar link road, and Srirangam. It is taken up at a cost of Rs. 3.85 crore.\n\nThe new plan would be implemented at an estimate of Rs. 17.76 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transport (AMRUT) and Infrastructure Gap Filling Fund (IGFF).\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and ICLEI South Asia will support the project.\n\nWhile the State government will contribute more than 80 per cent of the project, the corporation will contribute the remaining cost of the project.\n\nRockins Road, Bharathidasan Road, Bishop Road, Pattabiraman Pillai Road, and Rajaram Salai have been identified for implementing the plan. It includes an on street parking management system at various places in the city.\n\nA resolution to that effect was introduced in the recent Corporation Council meet, where the councillors gave their ascent.\n\nThe administrative sanction was likely to be given for the project shortly.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong need to provide non-motorised transport in Tiruchi, which is growing at a fast pace. The idea is to bring down pollution level and create safe zones for bicycle usage,\u201d a senior official of the corporation told The Hindu .",
