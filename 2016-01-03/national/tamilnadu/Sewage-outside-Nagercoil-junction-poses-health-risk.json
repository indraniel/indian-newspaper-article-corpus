The waste water flowing on the road is allegedly due to the block in the main sewage line passing under the service road, a person manning the bike parking said.\n\nPassengers crossing the stream of sewage water were facing severe hardship owing to the stench emanating from it. Children and even adults could be seen falling down while trying to cross the sewage stream.\n\nWhen contacted, the station manager said that he would look into the issue, as he has joined duty in Nagercoil Junction only two days ago.\n\nWhen contacted, N. Anand, Assistant Divisional Engineer (ADE) said that the problem would be sorted out in a day or two.\n\nS.R. Sree Ram, President, Kanyakumari District Rail Users\u2019 Association (KDRUA) said that the association would take up the issue with the authorities.",
