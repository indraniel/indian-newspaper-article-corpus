    "text": "The Coimbatore unit of the Communist Party of India has urged the civic boy to withdraw the underground drainage annual charges and one-time deposit. The Corporation recently passed a resolution to collect deposits and annual charges from residents at the time of giving house service connections for underground drainage.\n\nIn a release, the party\u2019s District Secretary K.M. Selvaraj said that of the underground drainage project cost, the Corporation had spent Rs. 43 crore and it received a contribution of Rs. 75 crore from the State Government by way of interest free loan.\n\nIn total, the Corporation has spent about Rs. 118 crore. Whereas, in return the civic body would get Rs. 405 crore from the proposed deposit for UGD and it would also get an addition Rs. 150 crore by way of annual charges. The money the Corporation would get, therefore, would be more than its expenditure.\n\nThe release also said that a look at the tariff structure suggested that the UGD service charge would be more than property tax in most cases. This move would have a cascading effect as cost of houses and house rent would go up to impact low and middle income group residents.\n\nIt also condemned the move to collect deposits from added area residents, where the service was not yet available.\n\nThe Corporation recently passed a resolution to collect deposits from residents",
