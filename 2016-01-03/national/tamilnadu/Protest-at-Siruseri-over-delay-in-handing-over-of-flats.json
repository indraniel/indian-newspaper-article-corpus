Madhavan\n\nOver 75 people converged on a construction site in Siruseri on Saturday to protest against the delay in the handing over of flats they had booked in a project on Old Mahabalipuram Road.\n\nMembers of what is called Green 201 Owners\u2019 Welfare Association said they had booked flats in a project by Green Tree Homes and Ventures, which, association members said, had assured them that about 400 flats would be constructed in five towers.\n\nThe project, called \u2018Green 201,\u2019 is located just behind the Siruseri IT Park and was launched in 2011.\n\nAccording to association members, the builder had promised to hand over one set of apartments by July 2013; but the construction was stopped midway.\n\nAssociation members said they had approached Chennai City Police Commissioner and filed a complaint and that they had been assured that an enquiry would be launched.\n\nA. Balaji, secretary of the association, said the builder\u2019s administrative office at Alwarpet remains closed and directors of the firm had resigned.\n\n\u201cI have paid Rs. 32 lakh for a flat and my father had invested all of his retirement benefits, which amount to Rs. 30 lakh, in the flat. All of this have gone down the drain,\u201d said Shalini, a buyer. Attempts to contact the builders\u2019 office for a response proved futile.",
