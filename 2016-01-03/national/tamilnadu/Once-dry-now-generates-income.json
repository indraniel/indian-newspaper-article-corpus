    "text": "The stalls marketing fish on the bund of the renovated Mookanery lake in the city are doing brisk business of late, thanks to the availability of copious water and abundant catch of fish.\n\nThese temporary fish stalls were not functioning for a few years due to the Mookanery lake remaining dry.\n\nThe volunteers of Salem Citizens Forum, taking advantage of the dry lake bed cleaned it.\n\nWith the western districts experiencing widespread rainfall in the last two months, the lake received copious inflow of water.\n\nAt present the lake is almost full.\n\nFishermen\u2019s association which had taken the lake on lease for fishing activities dropped about three lakh fingerlings of logu, kendai, katla, billu kendai, and kuravai varieties into the lake last month.\n\nNow the fingerlings have grown to fishes each weighing about 2 kg.\n\nThe fishermen are now selling fresh fish on the bund.\n\nThe sales picked up in no time and people from different parts of the city make a beeline for procuring the fresh water fish, both alive and dressed.\n\nThe crowd gets doubled during the weekends.\n\nLong queues of consumers in front of the stalls is a common sight on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nThe fish is very tasty, and hence is the demand, says S. Maninathan of Kannankurichi, a frequent visitor to these fish stalls.",
