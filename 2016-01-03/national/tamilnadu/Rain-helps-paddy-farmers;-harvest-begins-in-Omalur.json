    "text": "The harvesting of short term paddy raised in hundreds of acres in Omalur block is in full swing.\n\nThe harvesting is expected to be completed before Pongal festival.\n\nThe farmers of Muthunayakkanpatti, Thindamangalam, Kottai Mariammankoil, Sellapillaikuttai, Periyeripatti villages raised paddy in about 300 acres using the water from wells, and borewells.\n\nThe farmers of Omalur block in the past used to raise paddy varieties such as IR 50, IR 20, white ponni, and zeerak samba.\n\nWith the block reeling under severe drought like conditions a few months ago, they had to totally depend on well irrigation and as such they preferred the short term kuruvai, sona, ponni, rajini, and amman varieties this season, on the advice of the agriculture department officials.\n\nA few major tanks in villages such as Sellapillaikuttai, Periyeripatti, Kottagoundanpatti, and M. Settipatti got filled up a few months with the surplus water of the Mettur water scheme supplying potable drinking water to the residents of Salem Corporation limits. This helped in improving the ground water level and also the water levels in wells, and bore wells.\n\nThe farmers underwent some anxious moments after completing transplantation, due to drought like condition.\n\nHowever, their hopes of a successful crop revived with various parts of the district experiencing widespread rainfall in November.\n\nThe harvesting initially commenced in Muthunayakkanpatti village a few days ago and will be completed in the other villages too before Pongal.",
