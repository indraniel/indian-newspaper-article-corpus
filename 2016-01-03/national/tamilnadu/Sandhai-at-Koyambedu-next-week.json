Chandran, a wholesale trader, said such special sandhais are held twice a year during the festive season. Last year, nearly 500 small traders took part in the Pongal market.\n\nSources in the Koyambedu Market Management Committee said the market was being organised for customers to buy Pongal articles in same place.\n\n\u201cWe get Pongal items from various places across Tamil Nadu and traders are looking forward to the festive season after the dull business for the past one month.\u201d\n\nThe market will receive a minimum of 500 truckloads of sugarcane. People can buy Pongal articles like turmeric and ginger bunches. On an average, nearly one lakh people visit the market. This Pongal season, MMC expects a 30-40 per cent increase in customers. The Committee is also improving the infrastructure and safety measures and plans to hold a meeting with the police and traffic departments.",
