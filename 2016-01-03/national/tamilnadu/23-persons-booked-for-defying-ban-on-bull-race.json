Traditionally the game would be conducted thrice a year in the village viz. on first of Tamil month Margazhi, first of January and Pongal.\n\nThere are no winners or losers in the game and people won\u2019t normally try to catch the bulls that would be running in the barricaded street, Mela Street in the case of Mel Chozhanguppam. People would line up along the street and watch the running bulls.\n\nAs the people were unwilling to give up the traditional festival, they conducted the Manju Virattu on Margazhi 1. Police booked 25 people. Again they conducted the Manju Virattu on January 1 as usual.\n\nAbout 40 bulls took part. Again now the Kadaladi police have booked 23 people including Arumugam, husband of panchayat president Banumathi for organising the event. But none have been arrested.",
