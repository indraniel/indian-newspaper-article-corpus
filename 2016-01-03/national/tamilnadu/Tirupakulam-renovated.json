    "text": "A 7th century lake, and a newly developed park was thrown open for the public on Friday.\n\nTirupakulam is located near Narasimhar Temple near the Namakkal Fort.\n\nIt is said that devotes visiting the Narasimhar and Anjaneyar temples used to take a bath in the lake before entering the temple. Hence, it is considered a holy place by devotees.\n\nOver a period of time bushes and garbage destroyed the lake.\n\nThe lake was last used about 40 years ago, and thereafter it served as a garbage dumping yard.\n\nK.P.P. Baskar, MLA, sanctioned Rs. 15 lakh from the MLA Local Area Development Scheme to clean the lake. The lake was cleaned, bunds were strengthened, and pathways were created. A small park too was created with seating facilities.",
