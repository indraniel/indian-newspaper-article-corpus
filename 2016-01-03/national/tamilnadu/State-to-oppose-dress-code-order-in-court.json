A scene outside Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Temple in Chennai on New Year day.\u2014 Photo: K.V. Srinivasan\n\nThe Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department has decided to file a writ appeal before the Madras High Court Bench here challenging a single judge\u2019s order to implement a dress code prescribed by him for devotees and other visitors to various temples in the State.\n\nThe single judge had issued the direction to the Tourism, Culture and Religious Endowments Department Secretary on November 26 while disposing of a writ petition seeking permission for cultural programmes known as \u2018Gramiya aadal padal vizha\u2019 in a small temple in Tiruchi district on November 23.\n\nThe judge had specified that from January 1 men should wear \u201cdhoti or pyjama with upper cloth or formal pants and shirts\u201d and women \u201csari or half sari or churidhar with upper cloth,\u201d and children should come in \u201cany fully-covered dress.\u201d\n\nThe HR and CE Department\u2019s stand is that the dress code prescribed by the judge was not in consonance with the Tamil Nadu Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947, which permits individual temples to frame rules relating to attire as per their customs and traditions.\n\nCircular\n\nSources in the HR and CE Department here said that they had issued a circular last month directing all temples under its control to enforce their individual rules on attire only because of a delay in receiving a certified copy of the single judge\u2019s order and consequential delay in filing the appeal.\n\n\u201cThe circular does not instruct temples to implement the dress code prescribed by the judge. It only asks them to follow their customary practices. Even in our appeal, we have questioned only the correctness of restricting the attire to the list prescribed by the judge,\u201d an officer said.",
