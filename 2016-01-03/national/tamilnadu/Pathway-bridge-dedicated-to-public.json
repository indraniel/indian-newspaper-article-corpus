    "text": "The Corporation of Madurai has built a pathway bridge at a cost of Rs.30 lakh, which will largely benefit schoolchildren and senior citizens to cross road from one end to another with ease on Keerathurai MGR Street.\n\nDedicating the facility to the public here on Saturday, Minister for Cooperation \u2018Sellur\u2019 K. Raju said that the bridge would be safe for the children, especially, those studying in the Arupukottai Nadar Higher Secondary School.\n\nKeerathurai, one of the thickly populated locations in the city, has narrow lanes and a number of dwellings. During peak hours, children have a tough time to cross the road near the Kiruthmual channel. It is a risk for children as autorickshaws and two-wheelers move in large numbers. After the residents represented to provide a pathway bridge, the councillor S.T. Jayabalan took it up with the Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa, who ordered the construction of the new bridge.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Raju said that the government had issued 30 lakh laptops to students during the last four years at a cost of Rs.6,455 crore. School students numbering 4.81 lakh had received notebooks worth Rs.998 crore and 31.29 lakh students had benefitted by getting bicycles. The TNSTC buses had issued free bus pass to 68.45 lakh children to commute.\n\nChief Minister Jayalalithaa recruited 76,800 teachers and the government had appointed 20,920 among them in one go, considered to be a mega exercise. Mr. Chellappa said only in Tamil Nadu, womenfolk had got their due share of 33 per cent in local bodies. Out of 12 Corporations in the State, seven were headed by women Mayor, he said.\n\nCommissioner C. Kathiravan and other officials participated in the function.",
