    "text": "Cadet Maneesh Rajaa, a Class XII student of Sainik School, Amaravathinagar, is back here richer with a wider outlook on different cultures after been a part of an Indian delegation that visited Singapore on a youth exchange programme promoted by both governments.\n\nHe was the youngest among the 20 NCC cadets from across the country selected for the trip after some gruelling tests/camps. The remaining team members were all college students.\n\nCadet Rajaa was also selected for the Republic Day parade in New Delhi during 2015.\n\nAt Singapore, Cadet Rajaa and team members visited various educational institutions and interacted with people. The Indian team members also presented dance and other cultural items, besides taking part in sporting activities like kayaking.\n\nWing Commander Dominic Rayan, the vice-principal of the school, told The Hindu that the selection would help boost Cadet Rajaa\u2019s chances of getting into the armed forces and also give value-addition to his professional career.\n\nOn his return, Cadet Rajaa was honoured at a special assembly organised by Sainik School. Group Captain T. N. Sridhar felicitated Cadet Rajaa.",
