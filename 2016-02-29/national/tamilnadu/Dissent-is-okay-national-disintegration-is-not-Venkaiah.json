Chidambaram and the Congress, Mr. Naidu said they should clear their stand on the hanging of Afzal Guru and the Ishrat Jahan case.\n\nMr. Naidu said the Congress owed an explanation to the country on Ishrat Jahan and Afzal Guru. Congress first declared her as a terrorist, filed an affidavit and \u201clater, for political reasons, changed its stand and tried to implicate Amit Shah and other IB officials,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s recent comments on the hanging of Afzal Guru that there were grave doubts about his involvement in the Parliament attack case, Mr. Naidu said a former Home Secretary said Mr. Chidambaram never recommended clemency for Afzal Guru.\n\n\u201cThe former Home Secretary says\u2026instead it was he (Chidambaram) who approved the file and sent it to the President. The former Home Secretary opined that if he had any doubts he should have put them on file,\u201d Mr. Naidu said.\n\nAsks Chidambaram to make stand\n\nclear on Afzal Guru, Ishrat Jahan issues",
