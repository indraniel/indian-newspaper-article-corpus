Art in public spaces makes a huge difference and helps in reaching out to people from all walks of life,\u201d Mr. Gupta added.\n\nDelhi Photo Festival at Lalit Kala Akedemi comprised works of photographers like Kishor Parekh, Olivier Culmann and Raghu Rai, he said.\n\n\u201cApart from this, there was an exhibition \u2014 \u2018Surrealistic by Nature\u2019 \u2014 at Nageswara Rao Park on Sunday where works of photographers like Cristina De Middel and Denis Dailleux were put up,\u201d he said.\n\nPhotographs are also displayed at Apparao, Art Houz and Focus.\n\nThese exhibitions will be on till 13 March. Entry is free.\n\nMore taking\n\nto cycling\n\nSuresh Mehta is a software professional who has been cycling all the way from his home at M.G.R. Nagar to his office in Taramani for the past one year.\n\nLike Mr. Mehta, there are many who cycle to work for health and fitness.\n\n\u201cIt is the most cost-effective and healthy means of travel. You only have to cover your face during rush hours,\u201d he says.\n\nSeveral cycling clubs have come up in the city, organising long trails and marathons for cyclists.\n\n\u201cI recently went on a 50-kilometre cycle ride to Mamallapuram with friends from this club. We are planning to go on another one soon. But we also travel every day to work on our cycles. Some of my colleagues too have taken this up,\u201d says Siddharth Pachauri, another software professional.\n\nSeveral health and fitness experts across the world have recommended this low-impact exercise that helps improve focus, wellbeing and, most importantly, reduces stress levels.\n\n\u201cI used to ride a bicycle till I was 60 years old, but had to give it up due to health reasons. But I keep encouraging my grandchildren to take it up seriously as it is the best and low-cost measure to ensure wellbeing,\u201d sums up N Krishnamurthi, an 86-year-old retired teacher.\n\n(Reporting by Sunitha Sekar and Aditi.
