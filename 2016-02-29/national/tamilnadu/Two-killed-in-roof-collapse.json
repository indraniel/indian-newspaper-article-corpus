The roof collapsed when a water tank fixed atop the roof fell down. It was an old house and the roof was not strong enough to carry the tank, sources said. The deceased were identified as Lakshmi (55), wife of Thangam, and her daughter Muthumari (31). Based on a complaint lodged by T. Arumugam (29), son on Thangam, Sankarankovil police have registered a case.",
