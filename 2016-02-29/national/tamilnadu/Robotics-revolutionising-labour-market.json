Ramadorai, Chairman, National Skills Development Agency, delivering the Nani Palkhivala Memorial Lecture on the topic, \u2018Are we ready for the fourth industrial revolution?\u2019\n\nCiting an example, Mr. Ramadorai explained how the e-commerce industry was a threat to retail malls, but spurred the need for delivery staff. He elucidated on how amazon.com experimented with the use of Kiva robots to move boxes around its fulfilment centres and found the robots so useful that it bought the company that made them.\n\n\u201cAmazon deployed 1,000 Kivas to work at its warehouses. It then ramped that to 10,000 robotic workers, then 15,000. At last report, Amazon had 30,000 robots working for it. To put that in context, Amazon has only 90,000 humans working in its warehouses. As of today, one in every four full-time Amazon warehouse workers is a robot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor young people this means the only job security will be the ability to learn new skills. Replacing humans with robots in manufacturing is a trend that we can\u2019t stop or avoid, but we can be better prepared by being open to learning new skills,\u201d he added.\n\nA wake-up call for youngsters to learn and upgrade their skills",
