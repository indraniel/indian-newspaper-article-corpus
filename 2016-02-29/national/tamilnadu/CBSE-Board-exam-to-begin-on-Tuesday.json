    "text": "Come Tuesday, K. Parvathy, a Plus Two student will join lakhs of compatriots from across the country in writing her Board Examinations conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).\n\nThe first public written examinations of the year across all the school boards in the State, the CBSE exams come at the end of a particularly tumultuous academic year for students after the city grappled with schools being shut for over a month during the floods last year.\n\n\u201cIf not for our teachers, we would have found it tough to have enough time for revision. We made it a point to help out a few classmates who lost their books and notes during the floods and help them with revisions,\u201d said Parvathy. English will be the first paper and most students said they were confident of a good start.\n\nThe Chennai region has 56,948 candidates. In class X, there are over 1.62 lakh students in the region who will be writing examinations in 615 centres. With a more comprehensive system of assessment in place, a teacher said they had gone through a time crunch towards the end as they had to wrap up the Formative Assessment tests which had to be conducted for every subject before the final examinations.\n\n\u201cWe managed to finish everything to ensure that we could conduct pre-board exams as well as the practical exams with adequate time. The students now seem adequately prepared and confident,\u201d a school principal said.",
