R. Hemanathan, president, Srirangam Residential Property Retrieval Committee, K. Ragunathan, executive president were among those participated in the agitation. They highlighted the long pending issue and the plight of owners of properties. They said that the issue had not been solved for several years. With the temple authorities illegally claiming ownership of properties, no one was able to sell or pledge their properties. They also said that though the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had promised to solve the issue when she contested from the Srirangam constituency to the State Assembly, it had not been solved.",
