Manikumar and C.T. Selvam passed the order while dismissing a writ appeal preferred by Executive Officer of Mamsapuram Panchayat in Virudhunagar district against a single judge\u2019s 2013 order to reinstate an employee who was removed from service in 2008.\n\n\u201cThere is no hard and fast rule that the principle of \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 has to be applied in every case, and every employee reinstated in service, on acquittal, should be denied back wages and continuity of service\u2026 Once the conviction is set aside by an appellate court, the stigma is removed.\n\n\u201cThus, the employee should be restored to his original position as if he was not removed and continued to be in service all along,\u201d the Bench said while disagreeing with the Executive Officer\u2019s contention that the single judge had exceeded his constitutional authority by ordering back wages.\n\nSet aside\n\nPenning the judgment for the Bench, Mr. Justice Manikumar pointed out that a Special Court in Virudhunagar had convicted the Panchayat\u2019s sanitary supervisor Solaiappan on November 24, 2005 and the local body had removed him from service on December 22, 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, the convict preferred a criminal appeal before the High Court and got his conviction set aside on April 11, 2011 on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubts and the sanction granted for prosecuting him was not in order.\n\nThe judgment had attained finality since the prosecution did not go on appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nTherefore, he filed a writ petition in 2012 and obtained favourable orders for reinstatement, continuity of service and back wages which were under challenge in the present writ appeal.\n\n\u201cOnce the conviction is set aside by an appellate court, the stigma is removed\u201d",
