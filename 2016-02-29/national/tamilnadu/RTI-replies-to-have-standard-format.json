Kasthuri sent a circular early this week to all heads of departments, regional deputy commissioners offices and the zonal officers in this regard. The new guidelines for providing replies to RTI queries are based on a communication by the personnel and administrative reforms department of the State Government.\n\nMore than 7,000 RTI queries are made to the Corporation every year. But, residents allege, that most of the replies were incomplete and misleading.\n\n\u201cMost of the replies to RTI applications have been incomplete. I filed 35 applications this year and received replies only for 10 of them,\u201d said B. Kannan, Secretary of T. Nagar Residents Welfare Association.\n\n\u201cAfter our Association filed an RTI query on T. Nagar encroachments, the Corporation official concerned asked us to come in person to collect the information. When we met the official, he requested us not to ask such questions under RTI,\u201d said Mr. Kannan.\n\nIncomplete reply\n\nAhmed Sirajudeen, a resident of Perambur, said he received an incomplete reply from Metrowater for an elaborate RTI application on the building approval he had filed with the Chennai Corporation.\n\n\u201cThe Corporation officials had sent the application to Metrowater without providing the information on building approval which is actually the responsibility of the Corporation,\u201d said Mr. Sirajudeen.",
