According to sources, the poles on either side of the highway posed a threat to road users. As the poles could not be shifted immediately, now the Corporation is taking steps to shift these poles in coordination with the Highways Department.\n\nWith a view to setting up electrical works including laying of cables, the concrete structure of the median is being broken using concrete cutters for facilitating the setting up of poles. The work would be completed within a week.\n\nSources of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation said that the TANGEDCO would ensure supply to the new poles.",
