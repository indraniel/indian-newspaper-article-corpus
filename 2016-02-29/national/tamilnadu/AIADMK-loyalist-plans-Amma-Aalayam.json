    "text": "Iyeppedu, a little known village near Sholinghur, will soon attract attention. A Chennai-based functionary of AIADMK, A.P. Srinivasan, is all set to construct a temple for his party supremo Jayalalithaa here at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh.\n\nMr. Srinivasan, who is the joint secretary of MGR Youth Wing, Virugambakkam, joined the party in 2004. He had purchased a 1,200-sq ft land in Aishwarya Garden-II at Iyeppedu, nearly 60 km away from Vellore, in 2008.\n\n\u201cI am a devotee of \u2018Amma\u2019, and this temple is to show my devotion to her. She is like God for us. I had purchased the land as an investment, but was harbouring this idea of constructing a temple for our party leader for long. My idea has gained form now,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the \u2018bhoomi puja\u2019 for the temple was conducted with a small gathering of his friends, relatives, party cadres from Chennai and a few villagers attending the function.\n\n\u2018Amma Aalayam\u2019 will showcase the history and achievements of \u2018Amma\u2019. I have planned to put up paintings that will portray her history,\u201d the 37-year-old advocate said.\n\nA six-foot-tall bronze statue of the party leader will be installed .\n\nA visitor will get to see the statues of former chief ministers C.N. Annadurai and M.G. Ramachandran on either side just before the sanctum sanctorum, he said.",
