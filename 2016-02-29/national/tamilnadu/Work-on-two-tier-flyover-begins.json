The bhumi puja for the new project was held in the city on Sunday morning in which S. Soundappan, Mayor, V. Panneerselvam, MP, and others participated.\n\nThe junction frequently witnessed severe traffic congestion, and the construction of the flyover will put an end to this perennial problem.\n\nThe first-level flyover will start near the AVR roundabout and will split into two stretches at Five Road Junction. One will lead to New Bus Stand and the other to Ramakrishna Junction. The second-level flyover starts at Koranguchavadi and passes through Five Road Junction before ending near the New Bus Stand.",
