Kumararaja. Deciding to create a suitable space for people to perform the last rites, civic groups came together and planned to construct a concrete hall with necessary amenities in a plot measuring 1,800 sq. ft. The land belongs to Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR and CE) Department.\n\nThe hall was constructed at a cost of Rs. 15 lakh through donations collected from residents and philanthropists. The small building was constructed without uprooting and or trimming the banyan tree, Mr. Kumararaja said. The hall is located on Velachery Main Road, near the office of Chennai Corporation\u2019s 179th division.",
