    "text": "Bangalore University has decided to increase its examination fees by 10 per cent for all courses across the board with effect from this academic year itself.\n\nA decision to this effect was taken at the syndicate meeting held on Saturday. The fee hike proposal has come as a surprise as it was not on the agenda of the syndicate meet as well. It was put forth as a table agenda in the meeting and taken approval for, sources said.\n\nThe fee hike will effect all the 600 plus colleges affiliated to Bangalore University from this academic year itself. The move has come under severe criticism from student organisations who have pointed out that the fee hike was done surreptitiously and no prior consultations were held with any student organisation over the issue.\n\nStudents\u2019 bodies criticise decision; say hike was\n\ndone without consulting them",
