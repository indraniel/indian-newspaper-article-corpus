    "text": "Suspicion about illegal trade in red sand boa has arisen in the district after a gap of a few years following the arrest last week of three persons.\n\nThe three Raja (40) and Joseph Anandkumar (27) of Sathyamangalam and Ramesh (33) of Tiruvarur district were nabbed during a routine check by the Sathy police.They were found to possess a red sand boa in a bag and logs of Erythroxylon Monogynum that is sold fraudulently as sandalwood in two other bags, during the check carried out in the stretch between Vadakupettai and Puliankombai. The three were remanded in judicial custody. Though it has not been established as yet that the sand boa was caught in the forest area of Erode district, the three had probably brought the reptile for some buyer, District Forest Officer of Sathyamangalam Division K. Rajkumar said.\n\nThere was one case of the sand boa poaching four years back at Thalavady. Last December, a sand boa found by farmers in Avalpoondurai was released into Chennimalai Reserve Forest. The sand boa's mortality rate is stated to be high during summer months when they move in search of wetlands. It is an endangered species falsely projected to have medicinal qualities. In fact, it is a friend to farmers as the snake species enrich soil eco system as earth-dwellers.\n\n\u201cThe rumours associated with the reptile: that its consumption cures AIDS or that it brings good luck, are ludicrous. The poachers must be punished under stringent sections,\u201d Robin Bernard, Chief Executive Officer, National Snake Bite Initiative, said.",
