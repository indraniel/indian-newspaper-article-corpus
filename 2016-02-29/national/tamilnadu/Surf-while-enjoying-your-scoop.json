At the parlours, situated in prominent locations, customers can make their own combinations of ice cream scoops and toppings.\n\nThe high-tech outlets that have come up near Ashok Nagar Pillar, Besant Nagar bus terminus, Vannanthurai market and in Thiruvanmiyur on LB Road beyond Jayanthi Theatre signal, have seating arrangements and TV sets.\n\nBesant Nagar resident G. Ramakrishnan said: \u201cA lot of people visited the outlet on Sunday. It is nice to see an Aavin parlour maintained well with good service,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Aavin\u2019s first hi-tech parlour at Virugambakkam, these parlours too have snacks including cutlets, pizzas, burgers and French fries.
