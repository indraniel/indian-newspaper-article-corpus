Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan accompanied him.\u2014 Photo: M.Vedhan\n\nWhile DMDK founder Vijayakant remains non-committal to the DMK\u2019s overtures to strike an electoral alliance, the Dravidian major is not inclined to shut its doors on the actor\u2019s party. The DMK is rather cautions in its approach towards Vijayakant although it acknowledges that talks between the parties have not progressed the way it should have in an election year.\n\nOn Sunday when senior BJP leaders including Prakash Javdekar called on Vijayakant in Chennai, DMK treasurer M K Stalin sought to distance his party from certain politically uncharitable comments made against the DMDK leader by Dravidian ideologue Suba Veerapandian.\n\nMr. Suba Veerapandian, who heads the Dravida Iyakka Tamilar Peravai and is a well known supporter of the DMK, had in a blog post penned on Saturday, accused Mr. Vijayakant of lacking in ideology as he was simultaneously holding talks with three political formations, including the DMK. Mr. Suba Veerapandian urged the DMK to contest in 200 Assembly seats, saying only such an announcement would galvanise the mood of the party cadre.\n\nHowever, when asked about these comments, Mr. Stalin categorically said, \u201cIt is his personal opinion and the DMK does not share it.\u201d\n\nThe DMK, clearly, is not ready to write off Mr. Vijayakant as it believes that the coming together of the two parties will give them an edge over other political combinations. But the DMK had made it clear to the DMDK that power-sharing would not be possible.\n\n\u201cWe have conveyed that the DMK will certainly allot the DMDK more seats than it was given in the AIADMK alliance in the 2011 Assembly polls. Together, we can face the election,\u201d said a senior DMK leader, who is also instrumental in opening the channels of communication with the DMDK.\n\nA DMK district secretary said his party had agreed to give the DMDK its due share even though opinion polls indicated substantial erosion in the vote bank of Mr. Vijayakant\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cNow the ball is in the DMDK\u2019s court. It has to take a decision. We reiterate that it will benefit more from an alliance with the DMK than any other party,\u201d the district secretary said.",
