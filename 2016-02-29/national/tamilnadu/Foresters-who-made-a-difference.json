Krishnamurthy and naturalist par excellence M. Krishnan.\n\nThrough these personalities, the book traces the forests\u2019 history over a 160-year period. If you travel to the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy in Coimbatore, you may have to take the Cowley Brown Road, named after its founder principal.\n\nIts first Indian principal C.R. Ranganathan also finds a mention in the book for his outstanding working plans in Madras province. His theory of dual climax about montane sholas and grasslands is a pioneering one.\n\nIf you have been to the grave of Hugo Wood at Mt. Stuart at Anaimalais surrounded by teak, you might have seen the inscription \u2018SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS CIRCUMSPICE\u2019 meaning \u201cIf you want to see me, look around\u201d. He had successfully carried out artificial regeneration method of teak.\n\nThe present-day foresters still refer to V.S. Krishnaswamy\u2019s book, \u2018Thoughts on Indian Forestry\u2019 and T. Jayadev happens to be the forest chief with 17 years\u2019 standing in the history of the forest department.\n\nThere are vignettes too. K. Andiappan, as an assistant conservator of forests, was responsible for the Javadis road scheme at Tiruppattur before independence. K Venkatakrishnan was the \u2018Architect of Rubber Plantations\u2019.\n\nT. Achaya the \u2018Planter\u2019 finds a place for his invaluable contributions to the development of tea plantations, particularly the TANTEA, and, Mohammed Ansar Badsha for his dedication to the formation and development of wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nThen there are others who were not part of the department. \u2018Elephant Doctor\u2019 Krishnamurthy, a veterinarian, had treated more than 3,000 elephants in his career, captured 160 wild elephants and treated them, oversaw the birth of 99 calves in captivity. He was the one to perform the first post-mortem on an elephant.\n\nM. Krishnan is known for his magical writing, delightful prose and original thinking and one who had great respect for natural history. What is not known is that he had conducted surveys for 14 States and their forest departments across the country in amazing detail and depth.\n\nOne cannot miss out on Richard Radcliff, the man who stood like a Banyan tree - protecting and nurturing the Nilgiri Wildlife Association for over 30 years or E.R.C Davidar, who fell in love with Ooty as a child and went on to do a pioneering work on the elephant corridors of the Nilgiris and Anaimalais \u201cto preserve them in perpetuity\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning and more such compilation will be brought out in future,\u201d says a forest official involved in the project.\n\nThe book \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019 illuminates the life and\n\nwork of 25 TN foresters",
