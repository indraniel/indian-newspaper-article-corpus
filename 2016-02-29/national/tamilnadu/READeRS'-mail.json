    "text": "Clear garbage\n\nI live at Bhuvaneswari Nagar, Velachery, which is behind Chennai Silks. In our area, there is only one school \u2014 DVA Vatika. Corporation cleaning employees are not doing their job here irrespective of repeated requests by residents. Their excuse is that they are not able to clean the area because so many vans are lined up on the streets near the school. I requested them to clean the streets either before the vans arrive or after they leave. But they do not seem to be listening and the streets are full of garbage.\n\nThe Corporation dustbins are also filled with waste, resulting in a foul smell. It has become very difficult for people of Bhuvaneswari Nagar to move around. I request the Velachery division of the Corporation to address this issue as early as possible.\n\nBhavani Krishnaswamy\n\nBhuvaneswari Nagar\n\nShift post office\n\nThe Menambedu post office is located on the first floor of a building on K.K. Road, Ambattur. The staircase to the post office is too narrow for even one person to use it at a time. For the elderly, the situation is even worse. It is requested that the authorities arrange for its re-location.\n\nM.
