Around 1,000 manufactures and traders joined the party as members.\n\nAt a function here, the party\u2019s flag with Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s image was unveiled. A majority of members were micro and small-scale manufacturers.\n\nThe party was founded by K.S. Babuji, a Tirupur-based textile businessman and general secretary of Small cotton shirt and Inner wear Small-Scale Manufacturers Association (SISMA).\n\nHe told The Hindu that he had been toying with the idea of floating the party for the past two years as grievances of micro and small-scale manufacturers would be better heard if aired from a political platform.",
