Wherever the gestation period exceeds a certain time period, there is a mismatch of assets and liabilities for the bank. We can mitigate that by refinancing,\u201d S. Sankar, director, Corporate Advisory Group Pvt. Ltd., who is a part of FICCI\u2019s taxation panel, told The Hindu on the sidelines of FICCI\u2019s \u2018Energy 16\u2019.\n\n\u201cSolar power projects face two big problems. The first is funding, the second is realisation on selling power to State electricity boards. With respect to realisation out of sale of energy, an escrow account mechanism can be worked out to have a win-win situation between the power generation companies and Discoms,\u201d he said.\n\nK.E. Raghunathan, Managing Director, Solkar Solar Industry Ltd., said it would not be right to compare power purchase agreement pricing in different States. The pricing depends on various factors and cannot be uniform across the country.\n\n\u201cThe government has set a target of 100 GW of solar power in the next six years. In the past 30 years, we have achieved only 5 GW. The target for achieving 1,60,000 million units of electricity every year requires evacuation and transmission facilities. Who is going to invest in these,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTamil Nadu\u2019s clean energy markets can go further \u2014 research shows that Tamil Nadu\u2019s renewable energy potential is close to 680 GW, 85 times its current installed capacity and comparable with the U.S. fossil fuel power plant capacity of 781 GW in 2012,\u201d M. Rafeeque Ahmed, Chairman, FICCI- TN State Council, said.",
