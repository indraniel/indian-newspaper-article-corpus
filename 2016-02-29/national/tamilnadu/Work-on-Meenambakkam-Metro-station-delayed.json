    "text": "/Traffic congestion leads to fewer man-hours at station site\n\nThe construction of Meenambakkam Metro Rail station has been delayed due to insufficient time for people to work at the site.\n\nAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the delay in the construction of this station is because they have been struggling to get adequate number of man-hours.\n\n\u201cThis area has heavy traffic congestion and we got permission to work for a fewer number of hours in this station. But we are hoping to finish the work soon,\u201d an official said. This is one of the important stations on the stretch between Little Mount and Chennai Airport and the station completion is crucial since as CMRL has planned to commission the stretch in six months. Work on other stations on the route is in progress, officials said, but added that they faced a peculiar problem only at the Meenambakkam station site.\n\nAfter the construction of stations, track, signalling and other related works, Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety will inspect the stations and work and this stretch can be thrown open for public only after approval. The trial run of trains on this stretch started in November last but stopped owing to technical issues. CMRL officials said they might resume the trial runs by early next month.",
