Work on the new plant, with a capacity to manufacture 15,000 litres of ice cream in 116 variants, was recently completed. The project\u2019s cost has been pegged at Rs. 23.46 crore, officials said.\n\nThe building has been designed to make visitors watch ice cream mix being prepared and poured into the moulds.\n\n\u201cWe want children to visit the plant and learn about the importance of drinking milk. We have colourful graphic elements on the walls,\u201d said a source at the new plant where trial runs are currently on. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa inaugurated the facility on Saturday.\n\nIt takes about an hour to make the ice cream mix from condensed milk, skimmed milk powder, sugar, cream and fruit pulp and permitted colour. This is then kept aside at 5 degree centigrade for eight hours and then sent to the freezer where it is stored at minus 5 degree centigrade.\n\nIt is then poured into the mould in the candy filling machine and is packed at minus 30 degree centigrade. There is no human intervention except at the stage of packing it into cardboard boxes meant for transportation. The equipment has a capacity to make 6,000 ice cream candy bars per hour.\n\nThe building also has a paneer making unit where 1,000 kg will be made daily.",
