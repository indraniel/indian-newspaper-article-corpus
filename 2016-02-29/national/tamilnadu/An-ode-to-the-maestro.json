It's not easy to encompass the maestro\u2019s music in an evening, but they tried, and how!\n\nThe show, organised by Vijay TV and Ilaiyaraaja Music N Management Pvt. Ltd., and featuring the orchestra that plays for him, began with an invocation to the Almighty.\n\nWhen the maestro entered the venue, YMCA grounds, Nandanam, a display of fireworks lit up the sky above. And then, the audience, numbering about 15,000 people, gave him a standing ovation.\n\nAn instrumental medley of his hit numbers was followed by a performance by veteran musicians Vikku Vinayakram (ghatam) and T.V. Gopalakrishnan, who taught Ilaiyaraaja classical music. TVG spoke fondly about the composer who meant more than a student to him.\n\nNext up was the turn of Panchu Arunachalam, who introduced him in Annakili , and Bala, whose Thaarai Thappattai was Ilaiyaraaja\u2019s 1000th film.\n\nActor-director R. Parthiban got directors who\u2019ve worked closely with Ilaiyaraaja \u2014 Balki, P. Vasu, Prakashraj, K. Bhagyaraj, P. Vasu and Mysskin \u2014 to share their experiences.",
