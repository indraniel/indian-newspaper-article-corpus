Their families were given mementos with the photographs of their dear ones (donors) in it.\n\nThe co-ordinators said that the mementoes will inspire others family members and visitors to their homes to donate their organs.\n\nWhile Tamil Nadu tops in organ donation in the country, there is a huge gap between the supply and demand for organs. The organisers expressed the need to create more awareness on organ donation.\n\nLeaders from various religious backgrounds were invited as guest speakers to motivate people to donate organs. Organisers of the event said that persons from certain religious backgrounds were yet to volunteer and donate their organs.\n\nA stage play on the importance of organ donation was enacted by the students of PSBB Millennium School.\n\nIndividuals and organisations who wish to donate organs or undergo free training to become a volunteer or counsellor to facilitate eye, skin and whole body donations can contact Coimbatore Zonal Eye Donation Trust over phone at 90420-59595 or 98943-79679 or in persons at 53-54, M.A. Palanisamy Street, Saibaba Colony, Coimbatore \u2013 641038.",
