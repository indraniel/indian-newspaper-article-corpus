    "text": "Jesuit Superior General Rev. Fr. Adolfo Nicolas of Rome, who is the spiritual head of all 18,000 Jesuits and their institutions across the world, on Sunday appealed to the alumni and teaching staff of Jesuit institutions to work in tandem with the vision and mission of the Jesuits with a focus on socialisation.\n\nHe was visiting St. Joseph\u2019s College here, accompanied by his two regional assistants Rev. Fr. Lisbert and Rev. Fr. Anthuvan.\n\nAddressing a group of alumni and staff members of St. Joseph\u2019s College, he said a holistic growth of the students by value based integral teaching was the need of the hour. The educators should possess a larger heart, symbolically that of a giraffe which always saw above all barriers with a high wisdom.\n\nAs many as 300 members of the alumni and the staff of St. Joseph\u2019s College and the Higher Secondary School participated in the meeting. Rev.Fr. Sebasti L. Raj, Provincial of Madurai Province, Rev. S. John Britto, Rector, Rev. S. Sebastian, Secretary of St. Joseph\u2019s College, Rev. S. Mariadoss, Director of the Alumni Association, R. Murugan, President of the Alumni Association, Rev. Fr. Andrew, Rev. Fr. A. Simonraj were among those participated.",
