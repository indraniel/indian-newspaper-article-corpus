Every time, we have to complain to the Chennai Collectorate where the private operator, who manages online government services, is based,\u201d an official with the Department of Registration told The Hindu .\n\n30 applicants a day\n\nEvery day, on an average, around 30 applicants seeking documents to do with land and marriage registration among others visit the Konnur SRO after they register their applications online with the Department of Registration.\n\nThrough this online facility, applicants can get documents like encumbrance certificates (EC), marriage certificates, stamp vendors, circulars, society registrations, chit documents.\n\nFurther, applicants can also download public utility forms such as sale deeds and power of attorney documents.\n\n\u2018Work gets stalled\u2019\n\nI have been visiting the Konnur SRO office every day for more than a week to get a marriage certificate but due to internet issues, my work keeps getting stalled,\u201d said S. Vijayan of Nolambur.\n\nLocated off the Chennai-Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road, the Konnur SRO was opened in November 1994 after the bifurcation of the Ambattur registration office.\n\nThe existing online facility was introduced in the Konnur SRO three years ago to bring about hassle-free registration of land.\n\nPoor infrastructure\n\nOfficials blamed last year\u2019s rains for the connectivity issues and said they would soon set it right.\n\nThe Konnur SRO also functions from a dilapidated, rented premises and lacks basic facilities like seating and lighting arrangements.\n\nThe SRO covers areas like Mannurpet, Villivakkam, Nolambur, Mogappair and Pattaravakkam.\n\n\u201c A 25-cent plot of land in Nolambur has been allotted for permanent building.
