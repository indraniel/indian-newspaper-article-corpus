    "text": "The process of eviction of encroachers along Perumpallam - Nanjau Uthukulli irrigation canal belonging to Public Works Department witnessed obstacles on the second day on Sunday when owners of some houses in Shastri Nagar claimed to possess pattas and disputed the official drawings.\n\nThe Survey Department team had to practically demonstrate the measurements again to convince the residents.\n\nOf the 572 houses marked for removal on the sides of the canal from the anicut till Moolapalayam, 135 were demolished on Saturday, and about 85 on Sunday.\n\nReport to be submitted\n\nThe Public Works Department is required to submit a report on the action taken to the First Bench of Madras High Court on March 4. The remaining unauthorised structures exceeding 300 could be demolished over the next few days if there is no obstruction, official sources said.\n\nAll the evicted families have been assured of pattas.\n\nThe PWD that had issued several notices to the residents along the canal since 2012 could take a final plunge into action owing to the support extended by farmers\u2019 associations and Olirum Erodu Foundation who have together completed dredging eight out of the 12-km canal that has an ayacut of a little over 2,500 acres.\n\nUnder heavy police protection, the eviction is being carried out jointly by Revenue, Survey and PWD teams.",
