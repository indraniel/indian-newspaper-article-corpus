    "text": "Forest Department officials have commenced an ambitious project to vaccinate all domesticated animals in 17 tribal settlements and buffer-zone villages situated either in or close to Anamalai Tiger Reserve area falling under Tirupur district, against certain diseases.\n\nThe programme was aimed at preventing the spread of diseases from the affected domesticated animals such as dogs, cats and cattle to the carnivores in the jungles such as tiger, wolf and leopard that feed on the domesticated animals.\n\n\u201cWe have taken up the vaccination against diseases such as canine distemper in dogs and foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, among a few others, as per the direction of the National Tiger Conservation Authority. \u201cThis directive was subsequent to the reports of deaths among a few tigers and leopards in other parts of the country after the carnivores consumed the disease-affected domesticated animals from the hamlets adjoining the forests,\u201d District Forest Officer A. Periasamy said.",
