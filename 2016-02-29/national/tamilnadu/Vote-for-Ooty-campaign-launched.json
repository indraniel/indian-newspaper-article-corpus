Its life supporting system is on the brink and the local population had to bear the burden of this degradation.\n\nPeople will now have to rally together to have a political voice of their own for future survival. \u2018Vote for Ooty\u2019 is an initiative towards this objective.\n\nSome of the areas the campaign focuses are: restoring the name of Ooty through consensus; developing a comprehensive plan to promote tourism in such a way that the hardship of the local people is kept to the minimum and benefits to them the maximum; obtaining maximum price for tea through value addition and market development; working towards the long pending demand of the Badaga community for ST status; seeking a plan to fulfil the requirements of the municipal area for the next 50 years in terms of water supply, roads, markets, open spaces, play grounds, parking etc; bringing about a consensus among stakeholders to resolve the HPF crisis; to turn the sports loving town into a centre of state, national and international sports and sporting events and finding a long term solution to man-animal conflict in the district.\n\nThe volunteers of \u2018Vote for Ooty\u2019 campaign will undertake a tour of the complete Ooty constituency to list out the ward/booth wise issues and needs of the people to prepare a comprehensive manifesto, he said.",
