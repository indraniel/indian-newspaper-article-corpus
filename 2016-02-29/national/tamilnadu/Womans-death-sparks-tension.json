    "text": "Tension prevailed at Government Hospital in Tiruchengode when a 25-year-old woman died at the hospital, two hours after delivering the baby. Alleging that the death was due to the negligence of the doctors, relatives staged protest on the hospital premises.\n\nKumar (30), a labourer of Kumaramangalam Pudur, was married to Sathya and has two children.\n\nOn Friday, she was admitted to Primary Health Centre in Manickampalayam with labour pain and was later shifted to GH in Tiruchengode at 2 p.m.\n\nBut relatives said that due to the absence of doctors, treatment was not provided to her till 6 p.m. At 6.30 p.m. she delivered a male baby, but died later.\n\nStating that medical negligence led to her death, relatives refused to sign the documents for post-mortem and staged protest in the hospital.\n\nOn Saturday, Kumar lodged a complaint with Tiruchengode Town police. A team led by Tiruchengode Revenue Divisional Officer G. Mahatma, DSP Muralidharan and doctors held talks with the protesters.\n\nThey wanted the sections to be altered and post-mortem be done by team of doctors.\n\nThey also demanded action against the doctors for their negligence in duty. The police which initially registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC altered the Section as 304A (causing death by negligence).\n\nLater, doctors, Sangeetha and Karthick, from Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital conducted the post-mortem and the body handed over to the relatives.",
