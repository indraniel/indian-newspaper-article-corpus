    "text": "The family of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has expressed displeasure over his former scientific adviser V. Ponraj launching a political party using Kalam\u2019s name and portrait.\n\n\u201cThatha [A.P.J.M. Maraikayar, elder brother of Kalam] is totally upset that the name of his brother, who remained apolitical, is being dragged into politics,\u201d said M.J. Sheik Saleem, grand nephew of Kalam.\n\nSoon after launching the party at Abdul Kalam\u2019s \u2018samadhi\u2019 here on Sunday, Mr. Ponraj visited the \u2018House of Kalam\u2019 but could not meet Mr. Maraikayar, according to Mr. Saleem. \u201cThathaa was sleeping and we conveyed our wishes to Mr. Ponraj,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Mr. Ponraj visited \u2018House of Kalam\u2019 about 10 days ago and said that he was being compelled by a section of youth to launch a political party, the family members said he was free to launch a party but made it clear that he should not use Kalam\u2019s name or picture , Mr. Saleem said.\n\nWhen Mr. Maraikayar learnt that Mr. Ponraj launched a party and named it \u201cAbdul Kalam Vision India Party\u201d and designed the party flag with his portrait in the middle, he was very upset, Mr. Saleem said. Clarifying that the family was not interested in initiating legal action or moving the Election Commission to restrain Mr. Ponraj from using Kalam\u2019s name and picture, Mr. Saleem said, \u201cLet the people ask Mr. Ponraj as why he dragged Kalam\u2019s name into politics .\u201d\n\nMr. Saleem also made it clear that the family and \u2018Dr APJ Abdul Kalam International Foundation,\u2019 which was launched to turn Kalam\u2019s vision 2020 into reality, would have nothing to do with Mr. Ponraj\u2019s party.",
