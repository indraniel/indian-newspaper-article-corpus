Balasubrahmanyam.\n\nThe Governor said that instituting an award to honour the doyens of music was a befitting tribute to Mandolin Shrinivas. \u201cThe musical journey of Mandolin U. Shrinivas began when he was barely six years old. His vision for the younger generation was not restricted to playing mandolin but other instruments as well,\u201d he said, according to an official press release from Raj Bhavan.\n\nPresenting the award, Dr. Rosaiah said: \u201cS.P. Balasubrahmanyam is being bestowed with the award for his contribution to music. His contribution to the film industry is really a remarkable one,\u201d he said, and appealed to the younger generation to pursue music.",
