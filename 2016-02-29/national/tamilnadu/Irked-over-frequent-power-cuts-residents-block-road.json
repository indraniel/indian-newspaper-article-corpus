    "text": "Officials assure agitators that there will not be frequent power cuts\n\nIrked over frequent power cuts at Kovilpillai Nagar in Thoothukudi, the residents blocked Harbour Road, seeking immediately measures to solve the problem. Most of the agitators said that they had been facing difficulties due to power outages which affected their daily activities.\n\nSince no action had been taken to end the problem, the residents got irked and blocked the road. This would at least draw the attention of authorities to look into the issue immediately and solve it, S. Madhivanan, a resident of Kovilpillai Nagar, said.\n\nTraffic was disrupted nearly for two hours on the road. Later, officials from Revenue Department, Tangedco, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and NLC Tamil Nadu Power Limited (NTPL) arrived at the scene and held talks with the agitators.\n\nThe officials told the residents that they would not experience any more frequent power cuts and appropriate measures would be taken to solve the problem.\n\nThoothukudi Tahsildar S. Chandran said that a meeting would be convened at the taluk office here, involving the officials concerned and representatives of the resident association. Reliable sources from Tangedco told The Hindu that insulators attached to power lines got exposed to pollution caused by chemical water from power plants.\n\nTo solve the problem, efforts were on to execute silicon-based coating on insulators, discs, lightning arrestors and eight feeders. A private firm had been executing the task with imported materials to coat the electricity equipment, the sources added.",
