The persons were stabilised and admitted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital (GVMCH), Adukkamparai in four 108 ambulances.\n\nAccording to officials, the villagers had gone to perform the last rites of a person near a water body in Chinna Ongapadi. A swarm of bees from a hive on a tree nearby stung the villagers as the smoke emanating from the \u201chomam\u201d disturbed the hive.\n\nFollowing this, the 108 ambulance service was informed. Four ambulances from Pallikonda, Bagayam, Anaicut and Veppankuppam rushed to the spot. The paramedical personnel stabilised the persons and shifted them to GVMCH.",
