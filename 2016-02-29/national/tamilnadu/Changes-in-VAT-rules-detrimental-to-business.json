While doing so, the seller could avail imself of \u2018input tax credit\u2019 by subtracting \u2018input tax\u2019 from the total tax to be paid for the sale of the processed goods.\n\nHowever, in the amendment, definition of input tax has been modified from tax \u2018paid or payable\u2019 to just \u2018paid.\u2019 \u201cWith this simple change in definition, the government has made it difficult for businesses which operate mostly on credits,\u201d said chamber\u2019s senior president S. Rethinavelu. \u201cIt is customary to buy capital goods on credit and pay after the sale of finished goods, which may take a few weeks to months. So, how can we avail ourselves of input tax credit ? \u201d he asked.\n\nAccording to him, the TNVAT rules have no clear procedures to prove that input tax has been paid. \u201cThe amendment also says that assessing officer, however, can demand the proof whenever he feels it necessary,\u201d he said.\n\ne-C Tax flaws\n\nThe chamber has also condemned the move to make all transactions related to commercial taxes payment online through the newly launched e-C Tax portal, \u201cas it has flaws.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the officers are not trained properly in the system. They are not able to provide clarifications. So what is the hurry in shifting everything online at one go?\u201d Mr. Rethinavelu questioned.\n\n\u201cMany small-scale entrepreneurs are not tech-savvy\u2026,\u201d he added.\n\nPointing at an issue with the system, he said that it allowed a mobile number and an email to be used for one company alone. \u201cMany, including me, run more than one business. When all critical communications are to come through mobile and email, how can registration be restricted to one company?,\u201d he asked.\n\nIncome Tax system provided an option to register 10 enterprises for one mobile number and email, he added.",
