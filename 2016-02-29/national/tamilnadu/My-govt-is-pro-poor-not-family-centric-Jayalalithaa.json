    "text": "Narrating a story to take a dig at the DMK, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday said her government was for the uplift of poor unlike other parties with family interests.\n\nLaunching a slew of schemes at the Government Press complex in Tondiarpet, she told the large gathering of a story of two men. A king wanted heir to his throne and so organised competitions. Only two men cleared all the hurdles. The king gave them equal measure of gold bars and asked them to tell him after three months how they spent it.\n\nThree months later, both came to the court. The first one presented his son and daughter to the court and showed the exquisite jewellery adorning his daughter and a beautifully carved treasure box. The courtiers were astounded and told the king that he was fit as he had used the gold nicely.\n\nThe king asked him if he had only one son and daughter. The man replied that he had forgotten all his other children.\n\nThen the king asked the second person what he did with the gold. He showed 100 persons who had accompanied him.\n\nWhen asked who were they and what happened to the gold, the man told the king that they were all poor of the city and the gold was distributed to all of them using which they had become successful businessmen.\n\nThe second one was chosen by the king and his courtiers. \u201cMy government is like the second man in the story, who looked beyond the self and his family and implementing welfare and developmental schemes for the people,\u201d she said amidst thunderous applause.\n\nPower-surplus State\n\nThe Chief Minister credited her government for making Tamil Nadu a power-surplus State in the past five years .\n\nMs. Jayalalithaa inaugurated various schemes and laid the stone for new projects.",
