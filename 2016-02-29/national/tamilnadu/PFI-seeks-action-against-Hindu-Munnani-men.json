    "text": "Popular Front of India (PFI) members petitioned City Police Commissioner seeking action against Hindu Munnani men for bringing out a documentary film which, according to them, contains footage that could disrupt the communal harmony in the State.\n\nA. Wahab, spokesperson of PFI, told reporters that the documentary had lots of factually incorrect inputs like the one about a praying facility of Muslims at Thirumuruganpoondi. When contacted, G. Bakthan, State organiser, said the documentary film only documented the acts of Muslim terrorists in the State, but not portrayed any community per se in a bad light. City Police Commissioner M. N. Manjunatha said that action would be taken on the PFI\u2019s complaint based on the merit of the issue.",
