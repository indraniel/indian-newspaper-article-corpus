    "text": "Over 300 volunteers gathered at Marudhamalai on Sunday to clean the plastic waste in the temple area and removed 1.5 tonnes of waste, mostly plastic materials. According to C. Kishore, managing trustee of My City Clean City (MC3), volunteers removed plastic waste near the vehicle parking area, on the steps leading to the temple and on the roadsides. Some of the volunteers educated shop keepers in the temple area. This was the first step of the zero plastic drive, he said.\n\nEfforts will be made to create awareness among those visiting the temple and the shop keepers against use of plastics. Boards will be put up and measures taken to segregate and recycle the waste too. This was a joint initiative of MC3, Coimbatore Corporation, Bhumi Trust and Green Global Trust. College students, home guards, conservancy workers, and Rapid Action Force personnel took part. The Confederation of Indian Industry \u2013 Coimbatore Zone and Young Indians were the industry partners.",
