    "text": "Dissent is agreeable to the government, but national disintegration is not acceptable, Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu said here on Sunday.\n\n\u201cDissent, having a different view, there is nothing wrong, but disintegration is objectionable,\u201d Mr Naidu said responding to a query on student politics, at a press conference. \u201cUsing campuses for anti-national activities is not right,\u201d he said.\n\nEven as debate rages on in the country over the arrest of JNU students and what constitutes nationalism, Mr. Naidu said, \u201cAnti-government slogans are understandable, but anti-national slogans cannot be tolerated\u201d.\n\nMr. Naidu also hit out at faculty members of both the University of Hyderabad and JNU in veiled references. \u201cCertain faculty members with ideological leanings working in institutions funded by the government, instead of concentrating on academics, are trying to stoke casteist and religious disharmony among students, thus vitiating the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nLashing out at former Home Minister P. Chidambaram and the Congress, Mr. Naidu said they should clear their stand on the hanging of Afzal Guru and the Ishrat Jahan case.\n\nMr. Naidu said the Congress owed an explanation to the country on Ishrat Jahan and Afzal Guru. Congress first declared her as a terrorist, filed an affidavit and \u201clater, for political reasons, changed its stand and tried to implicate Amit Shah and other IB officials,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s recent comments on the hanging of Afzal Guru that there were grave doubts about his involvement in the Parliament attack case, Mr. Naidu said a former Home Secretary said Mr. Chidambaram never recommended clemency for Afzal Guru.",
