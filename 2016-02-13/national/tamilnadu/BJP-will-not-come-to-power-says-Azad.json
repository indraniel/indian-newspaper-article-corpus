Valsaraj on his completing 25 years as a legislator from Mahe, Mr. Azad said that people across the country were fed up with the performance of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. He said the BJP\u2019s performance in the last two years was zero.\n\nTaking a dig at the AINRC-BJP alliance, he said the BJP-led NDA has not taken the Chief Minister of Puducherry seriously. Puducherry is not at all in the agenda of the BJP. It is only the Congress that catered to the needs of the Union Territory. When the ruling AINRC assumed office lot of promises were made by the Chief Minister to get special funds and statehood for the Union Territory. But nothing had been done by the Government, he said.\n\nMr. Azad said the party should not look for alliances all the time and be dependent on political parties. Sometimes it becomes a habit to be dependent on political parties. What we need in the southern part of the country, particularly Puducherry, is determination and self-confidence.\n\nThough the Congress struck an alliance with the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu in 2001 the party (AIADMK) refused to have an alliance in Puducherry.\n\nThe Congress decided to contest the election in Puducherry without an alliance and yet we formed a government. Should there not be any alliance we are not going to sit. We should be confident like we were in 2001 and victory will be ours, he said.\n\nAICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik said that the ruling AINRC had miserably failed in performing its duties and there had been no perceptible development in the last five years.\n\nWith elections nearing the government will come up with many claims. The Congress will come up with a chart of the failure of the State and Congressmen will widely campaign against the failure of the government.\n\nFormer Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy said that partymen should accept the decision the high command would take on alliance and must put in hard work to restore congress rule in the Union Territory.\n\nAs Puducherry is going to the polls in the next few months, the ruling AINRC will stage machinations as was seen during the convocation ceremony of the Government Medical College.\n\nPeople should not be hoodwinked and should be cautious against all these machinations of the ruling AINRC, he said.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mr. Valsaraj said that although he hailed from a Malayalam speaking area he owed it to the people of the Union Territory for shaping his political career.\n\nThe function organised by the Congress is a recognition for my services for the people and I will be grateful, he said.",
