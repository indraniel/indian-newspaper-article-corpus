Sandhu said that the government had a policy to provide the jammers on lease in order to prevent unfair means used through radio frequency-based devices.\n\nAnd that the jammers could be procured only from the ECIL and the BELUGC Vice-Chairman H. Devaraj told The Hindu that the decision to permit universities to use jammers followed complaint from a medical university that students carried mobile phones into exam hall and had used it for copying. In 2012, a case came up in the Madras High Court stating that two students of Government Stanley Medical College had copied using a mobile phone. The college sought the help of Cyber Crime officials to prove that they used bluetooth. One student was barred from taking the exam for three subsequent sessions.\n\nThe universities can\u2019t procure jammers on their own due to\n\nsecurity reasons",
