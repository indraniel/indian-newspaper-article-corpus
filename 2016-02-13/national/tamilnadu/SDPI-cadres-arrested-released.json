Line Road, and a group of SDPI cadres came to the protest venue on Friday evening.\n\nHowever, they were stopped and arrested even as they reached the Palayamkottai bus-stand.\n\nThey were released later.\n\nThey attempted to stage \u2018sleeping protest\u2019 in front of the Divisional Office of Department of Highways",
