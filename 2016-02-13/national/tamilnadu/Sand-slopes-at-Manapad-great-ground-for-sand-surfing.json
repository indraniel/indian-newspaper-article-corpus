It could evolve as a potential new game at Manapad, which would attract scores of people, Mr. Bell told The Hindu .\n\nThe foreigner landed here to participate in sea kayaking and stand-up paddle at the sports event, which is underway at Manapad. \u201cThe tidal waves are not rough but conducive to surfing and remain smooth for long ride at sea. The serene atmosphere of Manapad is a sight to behold and people here should cherish it. In the coming years, Manapad would turn out to be a major destination for sea sports,\u201d he said. He expressed his desire to clean up the beach and streets leading to the beach to ensure a clean marine environment, maintained in an eco friendly manner.\n\nFurther, Mr. Bell said churches at Manapad resembled European architectural style and it was quite unique in this part of Tamil Nadu. The foreign national was here on an internship programme as teacher of English at Vikasa School. The three-month internship got off on January 5 and Mr. Bell said he would be leaving on March 28.",
