Beaches would be provided with sit-out facilities, floating jetty, small cafeterias, better roads and walkers\u2019 paths. Tender for these developments would be called for after a detailed project report was prepared. There were also plans to create a tourism circuit connecting Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram, he told The Hindu .\n\nCollector M. Ravikumar said that a proposal had been sent to the government for establishing a water sports academy in the district at a cost of Rs. 7 crore. Sea sports would be introduced on Tharuvaikulam coast which also had ideal weather conditions, he added.\n\nVolunteers of Puthu Vazhvu Thittam and Mahalir Thittam had put up food stalls on the shore.\n\nArun Miranda, programme organiser, said that apart from the scheduled events of sailing, surfing, kite-boarding, kayaking, wind surfing and stand-up-paddle events, slackline, beach volleyball and beach kabbadi events would be organised this time.\n\nTuticorin Sub-Collector S.
