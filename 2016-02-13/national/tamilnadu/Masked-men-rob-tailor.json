    "text": "Masked men robbed a man of over four sovereigns of jewellery after breaking into his house at Peraiyur in the district in the small hours of Thursday.\n\nPolice said a man yanked gold chain and bracelet from T. Senthilkumar (32), while he was fast asleep at his house in Tirumal Nagar around 12.20 a.m. The victim, a tailor, was with his wife and a four-year-old son. Woken up by the tugging, the man tried to raise an alarm. The culprit, who was wearing half-trousers and masked his face with a lungi, tried to flee from the house. When Senthilkumar chased him, two persons, also masked, emerged from behind bushes and menacingly marched towards him. Afraid of an attack, Senthilkumar slowed down and all the three ran towards a nearby tank and vanished under cover of darkness.\n\nHalf trousers-wearing robbers had made a similar attempt in the house of a retired headmaster in Usilampatti on Monday.",
