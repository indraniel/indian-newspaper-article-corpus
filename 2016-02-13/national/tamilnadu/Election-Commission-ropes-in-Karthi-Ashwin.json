We are looking to improve that and we are focussing our campaign towards that direction,\u201d Mr. Lakhoni told The Hindu on Friday . \u201cTo keep the youngsters engaged, we are trying to talk to them in their language and not be preachy. We are building momentum and currently our focus is on registration. We will put out specific campaigns to target each age group,\u201d he added. The Election Commission is also crowd sourcing ideas to get more user engagement online and is set to start a competition to popularise its efforts.
