It is the rhythms evolved from the drums of Koodiyattam music and Thappattam that translate emotions and sentence to the audience.\n\nThe play begins with the ritual creation of an image of Ganapati for the annual festival by a group of artisans. While creating the sculptor, the artisans look for inspiration at the physical, psychological and intellectual level for creation. They then participate in the festival\u2019s celebrations and its aftermath; when the icon is sent away to be immersed in the sea. It will be recreated again.\n\n\u201cThe play is structured as a recurring cycle of creation, celebration, destruction and return, which parallel\u2019s the motif in these birth stories. Ganapati , his elephant head and pot bellied human body epitomizes hybrid concept,\u201d says Vinay Kumar K.J., managing trustee and artistic director, Adishakti.\n\nDealing with multiple aspects of the Ganapati \u2019s stories in fables, myths and traditions, the stories are told in metaphors in this play.\n\n\u201cThere is no linear narrative,\u201d he says.\n\nIn one of the many stories about Ganapati \u2019s birth, a baby elephant bumps into Siva while he is looking for the head he has chopped off. When the elephant learns that the boy will live only if he gets a head within a specific time, he offers his head to Siva so as to bring Ganapati back to life.\n\n\u201cThat act of helping is act of godhood. When we look at our past, we learn how inclusive we need to become,\u201d says Mr. Vinay Kumar.\n\nHe adds that conflict has been a part of tradition. \u201cTradition is a by product of multiple conflicts and it has never been a singular entity. The play attempts to trace the past with its inclusivity,\u201d he says.\n\nThis production emerged from a grant made by the India Foundation for the Arts to Adishakti on the topic Rhythm as a text in Koodiyattam and Contemporary Theatre.\n\nIt is going to be staged at Bharat Nivas after a gap of 17 years.\n\nAcclaimed theatre personality late Veenapani Chawla\u2019s core team Vinay Kumar, Nimmy Raphel and Arvind Rane along with three others will stage Ganapati at 7 p.m. on February 16 at Bharat Nivas Auditorium in Auroville.",
