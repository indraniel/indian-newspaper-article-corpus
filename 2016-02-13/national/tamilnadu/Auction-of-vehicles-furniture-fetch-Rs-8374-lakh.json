Satheesh said. Three four-wheelers and one office furniture item could not be auctioned.\n\nWhile there were no takers for the birds, auction of vehicles always attracted prospective buyers in large numbers.\n\nDuring a similar auction conducted during November 2013, seven four-wheelers that attracted over 200 bidders were sold for a little over Rs. 30 lakh.\n\nThe Economic Offences Wing had received complaints from 9439 persons during 2013 stating that the companies had defaulted on payment after operating for six years.\n\nThe companies had subsequently abandoned about 12,000 birds several of which had died and the rest had to be sold at throwaway prices.",
