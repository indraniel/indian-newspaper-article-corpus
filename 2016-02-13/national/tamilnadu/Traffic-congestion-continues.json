Lakshmi narayanan\n\nIn the absence of effective traffic management in place at Thiruvakavundanur roundabout, road users continue to suffer by waiting for long hours and also being hit by speeding vehicles.\n\nThe roundabout is located on the Bengaluru \u2013 Madurai National Highway where the Suramangalam Main Road interjects.\n\nBuses from Kondalampatti take right to reach Three Road while buses from Three Road should take left to reach Kondalampatti.\n\nIn the absence of flyover, buses from Three Road pass through the roundabout to reach the Suramangalam Main Road.\n\nSince vehicles keep flowing along the national highway that pass through the city, the stretch is busy round-the-clock.\n\nThough traffic signals are present, traffic is regulated manually leading to congestion and chaos through out the day. During peak hours autorickshaw drivers help traffic personnel.\n\nVehicles from Kondalampatti that need to move straight towards AVR roundabout get struck, as bus drivers move to the left side of the road to take a right turn.\n\nThis prevents movement of lorries, and other vehicles moving towards AVR roundabout.\n\nRoad users wanted the median on the left side of the road removed.\n\nIf the service road is used, vehicles heading towards AVR roundabout can move without disruption, a few road users said.\n\nThey wanted the traffic signals to be made functional.The bus stop near the roundabout should be relocated so that buses from Three Roads to Kondalampatti can easily take a left turn.",
