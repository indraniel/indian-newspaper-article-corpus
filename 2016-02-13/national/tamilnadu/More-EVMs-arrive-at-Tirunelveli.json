Kulandaivel said that 3,460 EVMs and 3,453 control units were received from Gujarat recently to be used in the forthcoming Assembly polls. Since this number was inadequate as the district had 10 Assembly segments, 1,000 more EVMs and 1,600 control units were received on Friday to take the total number to 9,513.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll receive 5,000 more EVMs from Haryana shortly. The EVMs received so far have been stored in the strongroom in Tamil Nadu Warehousing Corporation building,\u201d Mr. Kulandaivel said.\n\nAfter due checking and calibration by the technicians of Bharat Electronics Limited, the EVMs would be sent to 2,929 polling stations across the district a day prior to polling.\n\nRevenue Divisional Officers P.
