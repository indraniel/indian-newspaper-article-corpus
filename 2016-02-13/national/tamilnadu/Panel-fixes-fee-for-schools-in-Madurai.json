    "text": "For LKG, minimum fee is Rs. 4,620;and maximum is Rs. 32,450\n\nTamil Nadu government has released the fee structure fixed by Justice S.R. Singaravelu-headed Private Schools Fee Determination Committee for the academic years 2015-18 on Thursday.\n\nTwenty-six schools from Madurai district are featured in the list this time. While there were more than 8,000 schools from across Tamil Nadu in the list released in 2013 for the period 2013-2016, the present list has only around 600 schools. In the 2013 report, Madurai district had 425 schools.\n\nA recent interim order issued by the Supreme Court exempting CBSE and ICSE schools from the purview of the committee is reportedly the reason for many schools not being present in the list.\n\nMultiple factors taken into consideration\n\nThe committee takes multiple factors, including facilities available, salaries paid to the staff, infrastructure, maintenance charges, transport cost and teaching aids into consideration while determining the fee for every school from LKG to Class XII. The schools are individually called for hearing before the committee determines the fee.\n\nOnce the base fee for a particular class for an academic year is fixed, the fee for subsequent years mentioned in the report is based on a 10 per cent increase per annum.\n\nSmall sample\n\nThough 26 schools is a small sample to assess the average fee charged across schools in Madurai, figures show that the fee for LKG would be around Rs. 11,000 per year while that for Class XII will be around Rs. 23,000. The report also shows that the highest fee has been fixed for Velammal group of schools in Madurai.\n\nThe highest fee has been fixed for Velammal group of schools",
