    "text": "In an important development at a time when speculations are rife that a new Vice-Chancellor for Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) will be appointed soon, Mu. Ramasamy, one of the three members of VC Search Committee for the MKU, has tendered his resignation alleging irregularities in the selection process.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu on Friday, Dr. Ramasamy, who was the Senate nominee in the committee, said that he had sent his resignation letter on Thursday through Speed Post to C. Murukadas, Chancellor nominee and convenor of the committee, and A. Muthumanickam, Registrar (in-charge) of the MKU.\n\nWhile refusing to elaborate on the issues he has alleged, Dr. Ramasamy said that he had already complained to the Governor, who was also the Chancellor of the university, about the irregularities.\n\n\u201cI have lost hope about delivering my duty as a member of the committee conscientiously,\u201d Dr. Ramasamy said.\n\nHighly placed sources told The Hindu that the primary issue was the number of applications received for the post of VC. Dr. Ramasamy reportedly alleged at several instances that applications received after the last date for submission were included for consideration.\n\nHe also alleged that the number of applications received and registered by the office of Registrar and the applications presently being considered by the Search Committee did not tally.\n\nSome of the committee meetings also reportedly witnessed heated exchanges between Dr. Murukadas and the other two members, the third one being Harish L. Mehta, sources said.\n\nWhen contacted, Dr. Murukadas refused to comment on the issue claiming that he had not received any resignation letter from Dr. Ramasamy. \u201cIf at all he has resigned, let him make clear what the allegations are. I will respond appropriately,\u201d he said.",
