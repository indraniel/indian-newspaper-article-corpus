Chelameswar and Justice A.M. Sapre, set aside an Assembly resolution dated March 31, 2015, suspending the six legislators and depriving them of their salaries and other benefits during the suspension period. As a consequence of their order, the Bench said their benefits would stand restored.\n\nThe action was based on a report of the Privileges Committee that their alleged misconduct on February 19, 2015, amounted to breach of privilege.\n\nThe six MLAs are V C Chandrakumar, R Mohanraj, S R Parthiban, L Venkatesan, C H Sekar and K Thinakaran -\n\nThe court ruled that the Committee failed to uphold the basic principles of natural justice by not showing them a video recording of the alleged incident. \u201cIt is the legal obligation of the Privileges Committee to ensure that a copy of the video recording is supplied to the petitioners in order to satisfy the requirements of the principles of natural justice The failure to supply a copy of the video recording or affording an opportunity to the petitioners to view the video recording relied upon by the committee in our view clearly resulted in the violation of the principles of natural justice i.e. a denial of a reasonable opportunity to meet the case,\u201d the apex court held.\n\n\u2018Being MLA not an occupation\u2019\n\nThe DMDK MLAs had also raised another contention, namely that their suspension violated their right to pursue their occupation. However, Justice Chelameswar, writing the judgment, did not agree that being a legislator is an \u201coccupation\u201d. He said the term \u201coccupation\u201d used in Article 19(1) (g) is \u201climited by the economic imperative of livelihood generation\u201d; that is, activities which enable a citizen to generate economic benefits and protect the fruits of his labour.\n\nBut the constitutional office of a legislator, on the other hand, is not a paid job. It is a \u201ccomponent in the larger machinery established to make possible for the people of this country to realise the goals indicated in the Preamble of the Constitution\u201d.\n\n\u201cConstitutional offices commencing from the office of the President of India are meant for and established for securing the goals adumbrated in the preamble to the Constitution. Any monetary benefit incidental to the holding of such offices is only to compensate for the time and energy expended by the holder of the office in the service of the nation. It is for this very reason that a member of a legislative assembly cannot be treated as holding office for the purpose of eking out a livelihood,\u201d the Supreme Court held. Membership in the Assembly completely depends on choice of the electorate and tenure is limited, it observed.\n\nSimilarly, the Bench rejected the six legislators\u2019 contention that their suspension amounted to the violation of their fundamental right to free speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It observed that the provision did not apply to legislators temporarily disabled from participating in the Assembly by a legislative body as per procedural rules prescribed under Articles 105 and 194 of the Constitution.",
