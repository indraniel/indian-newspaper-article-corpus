    "text": "A new super-specialty hospital was unveiled at Nungambakkam on Friday.\n\nG.G. Super-specialty Hospitals, a 100-bed centre, was established by Kamala Selvaraj, director of G.G. Fertility Research Centre, along with her family. Actor Rekha, her sister, inaugurated the new hospital.\n\nIt had all the specialties under one roof, Dr. Kamala said. \u201cWe also have an emergency casualty unit, a pharmacy and four operation theatres.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur original hospital, set up in 1982, became renowned for fertility treatment, and then there was no place to cater to other specialties. Also, we have found that as women become pregnant when they are older, they face problems such as diabetes and hypertension and need multi-specialty care,\u201d said Priya Selvaraj, assistant director, G.G. Fertility Research Centre.\n\nThe new hospital has been set up at about Rs. 80 crore, Dr. Kamala said. Lyricist Vairamuthu spoke on the occasion. Actor Raadhika Sarathkumar, film producer A.V.M. Saravanan and director S.P. Muthuraman were present.",
