    "text": "Even as traders of the Gandhi Market went on a strike protesting against their possible relocation, the Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations has urged the government to conduct an inquiry on the unauthorised shops functioning at the market.\n\nIn a representation to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations, said as per the original plan and record of the city corporation, the market had only 774 shops. But at present more than 2,000 shops were functioning, reducing the road width, he alleged.\n\nEncroachments and unauthorized shops were creating congestion, both inside and outside the market, he said and urged the authorities to remove the encroachments.\n\nThe number of shops should be maintained as per the original plan and unauthorised shopkeepers could be shifted to the new market, he said.",
