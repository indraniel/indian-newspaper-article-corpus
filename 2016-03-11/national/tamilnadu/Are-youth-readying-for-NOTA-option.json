He is among the many young voters who are to exercise the franchise for the first time.\n\nSameer and some of the other youngsters, who have cast their votes before, are sounding despondent that the successive governments have not addressed the real issues of the people.\n\nThey feel job creations did not take place in tandem with the rise in population, and corruption is getting deep-rooted in the echelons of administration.\n\nThe low standards governance, and poor selection of candidates, were making many youth to execute the \u2018NOTA\u2019 (none of the above) option.\n\nSays R. Veni (22), a post-graduate student in commerce, who cast her vote in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls: \u201cThis time, I have made up my mind for \u2018NOTA\u2019 as the elected representatives, and governments were not showing much interest to address health, hygiene and infrastructure issues on a need-basis.\u201d\n\nM. Sudhakar (22), and S. Ramya (22), both voted in the 2014 elections, and A. Raja (19), a graduation student who is a first-timer, feels that they would prefer candidates who would not offer any freebies to lure votes rather concentrate on development works or otherwise go for \u2018NOTA.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat we want is reduction in tax rates instead of spending the public money in giving away freebies that was never asked by the voter, and better public utilities,\u201d they said.",
