    "text": "Noting that proceedings against those elected to office by the executive had to be dealt with strictly in accordance with the provisions of respective Acts, the Madras High Court on Wednesday set aside an order passed by the Dharmapuri District Collector, removing the president of Molayanur Village Panchayat, allegedly at the instigation of State Minister for Education P. Palaniappan.\n\nThe petitioner, M. Krishnamoorthy, who belongs to a Schedule Tribe community, contested the post of president of Molayanur Village Panchayat in October 2011 and got elected. Soon after occupying the post, Mr. Krishnamoorthy alleged that he was ill-treated owing to his communal status by the vice-president of the panchayat Sundaram Dharmalingam, said to be a close relative of Minister Palaniappan. He lodged a criminal complaint against the vice-president under the provisions of SC/ ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. He also alleged that the Minister threatened him to withdraw the complaint. Justice T.S. Sivagnanam said, \u201cThe inherent defect in the procedural aspect goes to the root of the matter vitiating the entire proceedings.\u201d",
