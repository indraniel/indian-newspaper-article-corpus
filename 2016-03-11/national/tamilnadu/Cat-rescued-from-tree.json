Crows, and eagles started attacking it.\n\nWhen local residents contacted the animal rescue team, they told them that they don\u2019t have the wherewithal, and then they decided to contact the fire station.\n\nTill a fire tender reached the spot, the residents kept chasing away the crows, and eagles. Within minutes, the fire fighters rescued the cat, amid loud cheers, and applause.",
