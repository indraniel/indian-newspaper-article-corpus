    "text": "Members of the Central trade unions staged a dharna in front of the head post office here on Thursday in protest against rising prices of essential commodities and anti-labour policies of the Union Government.\n\nThe agitators raised slogans against the Centre and Puducherry Government for adopting anti-labour policies and tweaking labour laws in favour of the corporates.\n\nLeading the demonstration, CPI (M) leader V. Perumal said the Puducherry Government had failed to create job opportunities and the workers belonging to the unorganised sectors were left in lurch without adequate welfare measures.\n\nThe government should also stop outsourcing jobs and fix Rs.15,000 as monthly salary to workers in order to ensure social security.\n\nThe agitators also urged the government to take steps to reopen the Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mill and protect the weaving sector.",
