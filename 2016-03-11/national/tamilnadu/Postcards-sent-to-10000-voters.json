Veera Ragha Rao, voters were requested to take time amid their busy work and cast their vote without fail in the Assembly election on May 16. The message urged the voters to make Madurai district and the country\u2019s democracy proud by exercising their right to vote. Postcards carrying the message were sent to 1,000 voters in each of the 10 Assembly constituencies in the district.
