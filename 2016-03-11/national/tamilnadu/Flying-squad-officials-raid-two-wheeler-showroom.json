    "text": "Flying squad officials of Palayamkottai Assembly segment raided a two-wheeler showroom here on Thursday after All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries forwarded a complaint that two-wheelers were being distributed to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries.\n\nCarrying the stickers of DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin, a few two-wheelers had been parked in front of a bike showroom in Palayamkottai on Thursday. On receiving information from the AIADMK functionaries that the vehicles were being distributed to DMK cadres, the officials rushed to the showroom for questioning the staff.\n\nFlying squad member for Palayamkottai segment S. Muthukumarasamy, who visited the two-wheeler showroom to verify the charges, said that the bikes which carried the stickers of Mr. Stalin had been purchased before the election notification and registered in the names of different individuals. \u201cMoreover, the bikes have been purchased through vehicle loans from financial institutions and hence there is no poll code violation,\u201d Mr. Muthukumarasamy said.\n\nDMK Tirunelveli Central district secretary Abdul Wahab, who is likely to be fielded as the party\u2019s candidate of Palayamkottai Assembly segment, said that the vehicles were given to party\u2019s area secretaries and active functionaries between March 1 and 4 in a bid to gear them up for the forthcoming election.\n\n\u201cThe vehicles had been brought to the showroom to fit seat covers, rear view mirrors and other spares. As the bikes carried the sticker of our party treasurer, a few office-bearers of the ruling AIADMK had mistakenly given the information to the flying squad officials,\u201d Mr. Wahab said.",
