    "text": "AIADMK MLAs, who were highly critical of the ruling AINRC government so far, remained unusually tight-lipped on the last day of the 13th Assembly.\n\nFrom a partner in the successful alliance with the AINRC in the 2011 Assembly elections, the AIADMK had turned into a bitter rival after N. Rangasamy reneged on his word relating to sharing power and formed a government ignoring the AIADMK.\n\nSince then, AIADMK MLAs have been criticising the AINRC government and Chief Minister Mr. Rangasamy.\n\nHowever, ties between the political rivals, which were renewed over the Rajya Sabha candidature, have helped Chief Minister Mr. Rangasamy tide over the crisis following AINRC MLA and Government Chief Whip G. Nehru resigning from the post and, along with four other legislators, forming a pressure group demanding a say in finalising the Rajya Sabha candidate.\n\nMore importantly, it had opened up coalition possibilities for the Assembly elections in 2016. But both parties maintained it was a one-time affair.\n\nAlthough AIADMK MLAs staged frequent walkouts in earlier occasions, they remained seated in their chairs in the last session of the 13th Assembly except when Leader of AIADMK Legislature Party P. Purushothaman and Deputy Leader A. Anbalagan intervened briefly.\n\nAIADMK had turned into a bitter rival after N. Rangasamy reneged on his word regarding sharing power",
