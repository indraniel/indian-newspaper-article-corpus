    "text": "Uncivilised behaviour of devotees attending temple festivals is turning many parts of forest areas into a dump yard.\n\nThere are lots of temples in the Niligiris North Forest Division in Sigur, Singara, and Moyar ranges which are very close to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.\n\nThe festivals in these temples have attracted thousands of devotees.\n\nThe Forest Department rarely check vehicles carrying devotees to these temples for plastic items. The major temples in the area are Bokkapuram Mariamman Temple, Anaikatty temple, Anikal temple, and Siryur temple.\n\nAmong them, the Bokkapuram temple comes under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department.\n\nSiryur village has more than six vulture nests.\n\nThe place is frequented by hyenas, and wild dogs too.\n\nEarlier, NGOs used to clean up the area after temple festival.",
