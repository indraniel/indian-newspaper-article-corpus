They need to tell doctors about their occupation when they take treatment for an ailment, says K. Arul, additional chief inspector of factories.\n\nSeveral manufacturing units, including those that employ north Indian workers, now have facilities for the workers to play outdoor games, come up with balanced and healthy diet at the in-house canteens, organise health camps and encourage the workers to be more health conscious.\n\nDiabetologist V. Rajendran of Dr. Rajendran\u2019s Diabetes Centre says youngsters in professions that have a sedentary lifestyle (such as Information Technology) are more prone to problems such as diabetes.\n\nWith pressure and stress to go up the ladder at work, they have the risk of diabetes, especially if there is a family history of diabetes.\n\nDiet, lifestyle and exercise are important and doctors also ask the patients about their family and occupation.\n\nAwareness is improving among those who are diabetic.\n\nBut, among the general public, it is more of \u201cnot me\u201d attitude and this has to change, he says.\n\nM.
