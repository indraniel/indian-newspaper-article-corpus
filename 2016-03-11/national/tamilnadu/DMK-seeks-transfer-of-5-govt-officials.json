    "text": "The DMK on Thursday presented two separate memorandums to the Chief Electoral Officer seeking the transfer of five government officials, some of whom allegedly hold favourable views of the ruling AIADMK or are related to well-known AIADMK leaders. It also urged the CEO to ensure that they are not given any post related to election duties.\n\nThe memorandum submitted by the DMK\u2019s organising secretary R.S. Bharathi alleged that five officials, including two Collectors and two District Revenue Officers, were either relatives of AIADMK or loyal to the ruling dispensation. If they are allowed to oversee the forthcoming assembly election, there would be bias and favouritism in favour of the ruling party, the DMK charged.\n\nArasu network\n\nThe second memorandum alleged that the State-owned Arasu cable network was showing the pictures of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the channels run exclusively on the network. It also accused Udumalai Radhakrishnan, chairman, Arasu Cable, of favouring the ruling party.\n\nThe channels which are perceived to be run by other political parties are not given any prime slots in Arasu cable network, the DMK letter claimed. It also alleged that signals of news channels carrying negative coverage of the ruling party were deliberately being tampered. \u201cThese are serious violations of model code of conduct,\u201d the DMK contended.",
