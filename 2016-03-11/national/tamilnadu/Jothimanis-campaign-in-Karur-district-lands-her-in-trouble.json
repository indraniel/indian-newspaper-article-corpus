    "text": "A campaign that she launched in Aravakurichi constituency in July last year, ostensibly on the lines of the U.S. political model of holding primaries to allow electors to select their candidates, has put TNCC spokesperson S.Jothimani in the middle of a controversy in Karur district.\n\nAlthough Ms.Jothimani maintains that the campaign was launched with the larger objective of ushering in a political change, there is no mistaking her intention of projecting herself as the potential candidate of the constituency. Ms.Jothimani, considered part of the \u2018Rahul brigade,\u2019 started her political career as a councillor of the K.Paramathi panchayat union in the district in 1996 and unsuccessfully contested the Assembly election in 2011 and the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Karur.\n\nIn recent months, she has intensified the campaign on the ground and through social media as well. She has been meeting various sections of the people in the constituency and called upon them to give a \u201cmissed call\u201d if they supported her candidature. Calendars and pamphlets explaining the initiative have been distributed across the constituency. Her Facebook and twitter accounts with the hashtag, \u2018Aravakurichi 2016,\u2019 are replete with postings and pictures of her interaction with voters of the constituency. She has also formed youth groups to reach out to the voters.\n\nDescribing her initiative as an attempt to implement Rahul Gandhi\u2019s vision of ushering in a change in the political system and encourage people\u2019s participation in the democratic process, Ms.Jothimani says people have been totally alienated in the present political system.\n\n\u201cPeople should know the candidate they are going to elect. The candidate too should know the electors and be aware of the issues in the constituency. We have to create the space for the people to participate,\u201d she explains. Efforts are also on to bring out a constituency manifesto based on the interaction.\n\nHowever, she maintains that her campaign is not intended to lobby for the seat. \u201cIt is not just about getting the seat. I have applied to contest from the seat though. But it is for the party to decide to field me or not,\u201d she says. Asked whether the DMK would agree to part with the seat that is currently represented by influential industrialist K.C.Palanisamy, Ms.Jothimani says that is again a decision to be made by the two parties.\n\nHer campaign has raised the hackles of both DMK and Congress office bearers in the district. \u2018Bank\u2019 K. Subramanian, the district Congress president, says office bearers of both the parties have objected to her campaign as the parties were yet to decide on the allocation of seats. \u201cI have informed the TNCC president about this,\u201d he says.",
