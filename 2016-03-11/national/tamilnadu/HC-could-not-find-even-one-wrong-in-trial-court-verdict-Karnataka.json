Before you (Karnataka High Court) overturn the trial court judgment, you have to point out where it went wrong,\u201d senior advocate Dushyant Dave for Karnataka submitted before a Bench of Justices P.C. Ghose and Amitava Roy as he wrapped up the State's final arguments in the case.\n\nMr. Dave described the over 1,000-page judgment of Special Judge John Michael D' Cunha in September 2014 as a \u201cbrilliant analysis\u201d of the 18-year-old corruption case.\n\nThe verdict of guilt was overturned by Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy in May 2015, against which the Karnataka government came in appeal before the Supreme court.\n\nKarnataka has argued that the case could not be viewed as a mere instance of default in payment of Income Tax, but should be considered as one of corruption in public life against Ms. Jayalalithaa and three co-accused \u2013 N. Sasikala Natarajan, V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarasi.\n\nThe State alleged that Ms. Jayalalithaa had created a veneer of \u201cconscientiousness\u201d by drawing Re.1 salary. \u201cWhile on the other side, tonnes of money are carried in suitcases to the banks by her cadre,\u201d Mr. Dave had submitted.\n\nIn his submissions, Mr. Dave mentioned how it has \u201cbecome a fashion for political leaders to term crores of money they get as birthday gifts\u201d and the way in which some political leaders are considered as \u201cdemi gods\u201d by their followers.\n\nKarnataka\u2019s appeal has described the State's High Court judgment as \u201ccryptic, lacks reasoning and illogical\u201d.",
