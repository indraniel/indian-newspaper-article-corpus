However, election officials are yet to receive reports of such material being printed, from any of the 16 Assembly constituencies in the district.\n\nBut there is evidence that printing of such material is going on \u2014 something that is proved by reports of illegal posters and banners received by Chennai District Election Office.\n\n\u201cPolitical party representatives are worried because we are planning to factor in the material submitted by them while calculating the expenditure,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe printing of election-related material is governed by the provisions of Section 127A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\n\nPrinters have been asked not to print or publish any election pamphlet or poster that does not bear on its face the names and addresses of the printer and the publisher.\n\nMeeting\n\nMore than 100 printers participated in a meeting organised by the Chennai District Election Office this week.\n\nRestrictions on printing of election pamphlets and posters have been imposed under the law. Punitive or preventive action will be initiated against persons who flout this rule.\n\nElection officials are exploring alternatives to track unauthorised election expenditure by political parties, candidates and their supporters on the printing and publication of election pamphlets and posters.",
