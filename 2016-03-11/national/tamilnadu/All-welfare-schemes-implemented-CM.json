He said, heeding the advice, suggestions and demands of the MLAs, the government executed all programmes during preceding years and implemented all welfare programmes promised during elections in spite of government facing financial constraints.\n\n\u201cWe were paying adequate attention in getting more funds from the Centre and more revenue to the UT exchequer without taxing the people,\u201d said Mr. Rangasamy while listing out measures to improve education, medical facilities and infrastructure.\n\nHe also added that the government has been completing works recommended by MLAs under constituency development funds without any complaints.\n\nMr. Rangasamy recalled that though there was delay in getting fund to render financial assistance to rain-affected people, the government has managed to extend such assistance in due time. He said it was the wish of government to render assistance to 6000 people who were left out in Karaikal. Stating that the government accorded high priority to extend super specialty medical care to the people, he also pointed that the steps have been taken to commence a branch of Jipmer in Karaikal.\n\nThanking the MLAs for their support in running the House, the Speaker V.
