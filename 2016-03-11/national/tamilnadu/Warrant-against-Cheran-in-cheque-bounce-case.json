Veluchamy ordered the issue of bailable warrant against Mr. Cheran and his daughter Nivetha Priyadarshini on Thursday after noting that the two accused, who represented C2H Network Private Limited, failed to appear before the court in response to the summons issued on February 10.\n\nIn a brief order, the Magistrate noted that court records showed that the fresh summons were received by the two accused but they were absent on Thursday. Counsel for Mr. Cheran and his daughter filed a petition, seeking to dispense with their personal appearance, but the Magistrate refused to entertain it.\n\nC. Palaniappan, who was appointed as distributor for the district by C2H Network in his private complaint, said Mr. Cheran, after floating the company to supply original DVDs directly to people on the same day whenever new films were released, appointed distributors throughout the State. He was appointed a distributor after he deposited Rs. 8.40 lakh.\n\nAs the company failed to take off, he wanted the deposit returned. Mr. Cheran as director of the company and his daughter as managing director had issued a cheque for the amount, he said. He had presented the cheque in a bank on August 17, 22 and 28, but it bounced on all three occasions, he said.",
