Kindly pardon me. I am solely responsible for this act.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the suicide note, a police officer said that his handwriting was not shaky and the act appeared to be pre-meditated.\n\nDevendra was working in Ghana, South Africa, for the past two years and was staying with his sister there.\n\n\u201cHe was into online trading. His wife was ailing and he is suspected to have been facing financial problems. He therefore returned to Chennai last month. On Wednesday night, the family even went for a movie,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nDevendra\u2019s parents saw the bodies and alerted the neighbours. Devendra had been staying on the second floor of a nearly 50-year-old building with his wife and two children.\n\nDevendra\u2019s parents \u2014 Vishwambarnath and Jayadevi \u2014 also stay on the same floor but in a different house, said the police.\n\n\u201cAround 5.30 a.m, Jayadevi went to Devendra\u2019s house and found the four lying in a pool of blood. She alerted us and we informed the neighbours. They have been staying here for nearly 20 years,\u201d said Diwakar, who stays on the same building which houses five families.\n\nThe Kothavalchavadi police reached the spot and took the bodies to the Stanley Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination. During investigation, it was found that Devendra had committed the crime using a new knife.\n\n\u201cWe suspect he sprayed or gave something to his wife and children to prevent them from making any noise,\u201d the officer said.\n\nHis neighbours remember Devendra as a friendly person.\n\n\u201cWhen we used to pump water, he would carry the pots to the second floor without anyone asking him. Recently, he asked me if I could teach his son Tamil,\u201d said a neighbour who didn\u2019t want to be named. A case has been registered and further investigation is on. Forensic experts were also pressed into service.\n\nSneha\u2019s suicide prevention helpline can be reached at 2464 0050/60. The State health helpline can be reached at 104.\n\nThe bodies were discovered by his parents who live in another house on the same floor",
