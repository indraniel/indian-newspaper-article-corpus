Officials will analyse the reasons for low turnout and come up with programmes for these areas after a study of what would connect with them.\n\n\u201cProgrammes will be designed to address the social or cultural factors, if any, that caused the low turnout during the last elections,\u201d said the official. Street plays may be adopted in areas where they can be expected to strike a chord with residents.\n\nChennai District Election Office is likely to focus on creating awareness among school children in such neighbourhoods to persuade their parents to vote in elections. New activities have also been planned on social media.\n\nStreet plays may be adopted in areas where they can be expected to strike\n\na chord",
