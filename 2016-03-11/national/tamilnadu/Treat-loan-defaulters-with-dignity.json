This is unwarranted considering that the banks have issued loans against mortgaging property,\u201d said M.P. Muthurathinam, president of Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association.\n\nHe said that the banks were granting about 70 per cent of the value of the properties mortgaged as loans.\n\nThe banks could easily recover the payments by selling off the properties.\n\nShaming the businessmen could even lead to suicides, he added.\n\nA large section of small and medium scale exporters have sent a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting the government to direct banks against publishing photographs of defaulters, and instead help them restructure the bad loans.\n\nNot harassment\n\nBanking sources said that photographs were published only in the case of \u2018intentional defaulters\u2019 who either had been given ample opportunities to repay the loan, or were found to have diverted the funds obtained as loans for some other purposes.\n\nPhotographs are published to create make society know the persons who did not repay the public money, said a bank official.",
