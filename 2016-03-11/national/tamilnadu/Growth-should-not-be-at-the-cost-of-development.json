He said that despite India being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the country continued to fare poorly in Human Development Index, even in comparison with its BRICS counterparts.\n\nAs improving HDI was an enormous task involving enhancement of livelihood opportunities, education, housing, employment etc., development professionals had a huge role to play. \u201cDevelopment professionals like you have to play a critical role in addressing issues related to poverty and other socio-economic problems,\u201d he said, addressing the graduating students of Tata-Dhan Academy.\n\nHe urged the students not to turn a blind eye to the injustices and inequalities prevailing in the country.\n\nMr. Bhanwala also highlighted the measures being taken by Nabard to address issues in agriculture sector. Pointing to the high priority given to agriculture and rural development in the Union Budget and the government\u2019s aim of doubling farmers\u2019 income in five years, Mr. Bhanwala said that the primary focus would be on enhancing irrigation capacity and efficient use of water.\n\nClaiming that land available per farmer was coming down owing to increase in population and other factors, he also stressed the need for shifting excess labour in agriculture to other sectors.\n\nForty students who had completed Post-Graduate Diploma in Development Management received their certificates at the function.\n\nB. T. Bangera, chairman, DHAN Foundation, M. P. Vasimalai, chairman, Tata-Dhan Academy, A. Gurunathan, Director, Tata-Dhan Academy, P. Chinnapillai, president, Kalanjiam Mutual Movement, R. Vasavalingam, president, Dhan Vayalagam Movement, and Govindhan, president, Neidhal Movement, were present at the function.",
