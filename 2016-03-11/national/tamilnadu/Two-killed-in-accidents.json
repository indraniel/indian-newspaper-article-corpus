    "text": "Two youths were killed in separate accidents in the district since Wednesday night.\n\nS. Sureshkumar (25), a milk vendor from Melaneelithanallur was going to Kurukkalpatti on his motorcycle to buy milk from his suppliers on Thursday morning. Near Melaneelithanallur union office, a speeding private bus knocked him down. Having sustained grievous injuries, Sureshkumar, who was to get married on March 18, died on the spot. As the news spread, relatives of the deceased staged a road blockade and prevented the police from sending the body for post-mortem. After the police assured that the bus driver would be nabbed, they gave up the agitation. Subsequently, the police arrested bus driver Paulpandi of Veeriruppu near Sankarankoil.\n\nIn the other accident, Suresh (32) of Araikulam near here and his friend Periasamy of Kumarapuram were coming to Tirunelveli on a motorcycle on Wednesday night. At Ponnakudi, the two-wheeler hit a lorry from behind in which Suresh and Periasamy sustained injuries. While Suresh succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital, Periasamy has been admitted for treatment. Munneerpallam police have registered a case against lorry driver Paramasivam.",
