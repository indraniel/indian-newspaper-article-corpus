The Media Certification and Monitoring Committee certificate can be obtained at the district level if the drama is political in nature.\n\nA majority of members in Nadigar Sangam are drama artistes.\n\nFilm actor and theatre artiste Pasupathi said theatre artistes requested the Nadigar Sangam to help them stage plays without any interference because of the elections.\n\n\u201cThe elections are at a time when smaller theatre groups that conduct street plays are at a disadvantage as they are sometimes stopped by the authorities. The reason is that the art forms such as Theru Koothu are performed at night. Since April-May are the busy months in their calendar, they requested us to explain it to the Election Officer. The officer has also said that plays can be conducted without any issue as long as they do not contain any party propaganda,\u201d he said.",
