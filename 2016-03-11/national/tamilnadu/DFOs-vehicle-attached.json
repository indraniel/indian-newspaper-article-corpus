    "text": "The official vehicle of the Kanyakumari District Forest Officer was attached by the additional sub-court here on Thursdayfor failure to provide compensation of Rs. 4.25 lakh, with three per cent interest to a farmer, Rajiv of Pechiparai.\n\nAdditional Sub-Judge Thirumagal had ordered the attachment of the DFO\u2019s official vehicle and other property on February 16.\n\nA. Gopal Doss, Assistant Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that the Kulasekaram Forest Ranger, during 2002, had evicted the farmer, who had allegedly undertaken farming activities on about 2.75 acres in Neeliathodu near Kothaiar Power House inside the Reserve Forest for many years.\n\nThe farmer had claimed that he had cultivated 525 rubber trees which were ready for rubber tapping. He also contended that the officials had removed the crops and a power shed without any prior intimation and caused heavy loss. He also filed a case in Padmanabhapuram court claiming suitable compensation.\n\nHearing the case, the Padmanabhapuram court had directed the District Forest Officer to pay a compensation of Rs. 4.25 lakh, with three per cent simple interest. As the authorities failed to pay the compensation, the farmer appealed in the additional sub-court in Nagercoil, which ordered the attachment.\n\nMr. Gopal Doss said that based on a request the court officials did not attach the office property.\n\nHowever, the forest department is planning to go for appeal against the order of the Padmanabhapuram court and the attachment.",
