    "text": "With just weeks to go for the Assembly elections, discord among Congress MLAs came out into the open with MLAs, including former Minister Theni C.Djeacoumar and P.R.N. Thirumurugan, remaining in their seats when five MLAs led by Leader of Opposition V.Vaithilingam staged a walkout from the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, five of seven Congress legislators, led by Mr. Vaithilingam, staged a walkout in protest against the Speaker\u2019s denial to allow discussion on Supplementary Expenditure for fiscal year 2015-16, tabled by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy.\n\nSurprisingly, Congress MLA Malladi Krishna Rao from Yanam who has been distant from the party for some time, toed the party line and joined the MLAs in the walkout. AIADMK unit secretary P. Purushothaman was believed to woo Mr. Rao to side with the AIADMK.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, Mr. Rao, was seen chatting with Mr. Vaithilingam and other MLAs E.Valsaraj, A.Namassivayam and K.Lakshminarayanan,.\n\nTheni C.Djeacoumar and P.N.R. Tirumurugan remained in the House till the end of proceedings. The two MLAs have been avoiding party platforms and making overtures towards the ruling AINRC for the last few months.\n\nMr. Djeacoumar told The Hindu : \u201cWe were not told about staging a walkout. I am very much in the Congress and will contest on Congress ticket in the forthcoming election.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Congress Legislature Party meeting was held on Wednesday at the residence of Mr. Krishna Rao. Pradesh Congress Committee president A.Namassivayam said, \u201cNobody can break the party. The Congress party is like a great banyan tree where migratory birds come and go.\u201d",
