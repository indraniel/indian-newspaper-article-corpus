Radhakrishnan, according to a press release.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan, the release said, was speaking at an event held to commemorate World Kidney Day at Sri Ramachandra University on Thursday. While the State tops the country in cadaver organ transplants, there is also a rise in kidney problems in young children and there is a need for an all-round intensive awareness programme on lifestyle and health aspects for these children, he added.\n\nChildren who had undergone successful kidney transplants were honoured.",
