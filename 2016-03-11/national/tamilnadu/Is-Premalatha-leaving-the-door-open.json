    "text": "The DMDK\u2019s meeting on Thursday clearly sent shockwaves through Tamil Nadu\u2019s politics with Vijayakant\u2019s announcement that the party would contest alone. But there was also a curious intervention by his wife Premalatha that provided a final twist. Unlike past meetings of the DMDK, the one on Thursday saw a unique development. While usually it was Mr. Vijayakant who delivers the final address, Ms. Premalatha chose to \u201cseek\u201d his permission after his speech to make a crucial intervention.\n\nWhile the DMDK president reiterated four times in his short speech that he would contest \u201calone\u201d, Ms. Premalatha said like-minded parties could still approach Mr. Vijayakant for talks.\n\nSources in both the People\u2019s Welfare Front (PWF) and the BJP chose to interpret this as an attempt by Ms. Premalatha to keep the doors open to them. Essentially, they feel it was the DMDK\u2019s way of stating that the party would head the alliance it forms. Speeches by Mr. Vijayakant and Ms. Premalatha have always stood out for their subtle contrasts.",
