K. Gopalakrishnan, one of the senior representatives of the small-scale power loom job working units who participated in the talks, told The Hindu that the previous two-and-a-half year agreement signed between the power loom job working units and the textile units expired on November 30, 2015.\n\nHowever, the job work charges did not get revised till now, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking for a 25 per cent increase in the charges for the first year and 10 per cent each for the subsequent two years\u201d, he added.\n\nThe reasons cited by the job working unit owners for an upward revision included escalation in costs of spare parts and operation.",
