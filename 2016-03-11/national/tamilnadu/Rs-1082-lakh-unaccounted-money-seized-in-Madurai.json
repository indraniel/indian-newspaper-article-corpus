The car along with the cash was taken to the Collectorate for further investigation. As the persons failed to produce documents to show the source of the money, the cash was seized by the officials at the Election Control Room.\n\nA similar incident was reported at Iravadanallur, coming under Madurai South constituency, when one of the static surveillance teams was checking vehicles. The team members found Rs. 82,000 in a car belonging to T. Subramanian, running an auto consultancy business on New Ramnad Road.\n\nOfficials said that though the person claimed that he was carrying the money for buying car tyre, he did not have appropriate documents.\n\nAs per the Election Commission norms, it is a violation to carry more than Rs. 50,000 without valid documents when the MCC is in force.\n\nCollector and Election Officer K. Veera Raghava Rao told The Hindu that the cash would be deposited in treasury. \u201cTo claim the money back, they should provide documents showing the source of the money. A three-member committee would scrutinise the documents and decide whether the money can be released or not.\u201d",
