Mr. Vijayakant said too many rumours had been spread about the party\u2019s position on alliance over the last three months. \u201cI will contest alone. I thank those who invited me to their alliances,\u201d he declared. Denying that he had negotiated with any political party, as reported in sections of the media, he said, \u201cSome said crores of money had changed hands. What do you say now? I reiterate that we will contest this election alone.\u201d A seven-member committee headed by party youth wing secretary L.K. Sudheesh to finalise the candidate list for all 234 Assembly constituencies. The party also released its manifesto on the occasion. However, towards the close of the meeting, Mr. Vijayakant\u2019s wife and party women\u2019s wing secretary Premalatha appealed to parties that shared the aim of the DMDK should talk to Mr. Vijayakant.\n\nLaunched in September 2005, the DMDK contested the 2006 Assembly elections alone and secured over 8 per cent vote share. This went up to 10.3 per cent in 2009 Parliamentary elections. In 2011, the party aligned with the AIADMK and won 29 seats, making it the main opposition in the Assembly.\n\nAIADMK, DMK attacked\n\nEarlier, Ms. Premalatha lashed out at both the AIADMK and the DMK, accusing them of encouraging corruption in administration.\n\n\u201cThe DMDK was formed as an alternative to the AIADMK and the DMK. It is true we aligned with the AIADMK in 2011. But the moment our leader realised the government was initiating anti-government policies, he stormed out of the alliance. Our aim is to drive the two parties out of Tamil Nadu,\u201d she added.\n\nMs. Premalatha also took on the media for publishing what she called \u201cplants\u201d the DMK had floated.",
