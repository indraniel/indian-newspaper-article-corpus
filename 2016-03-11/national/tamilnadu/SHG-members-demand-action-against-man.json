Gurunathan married another woman last year without informing Ms. Chandra and started torturing her, they claimed.\n\nMs. Chandra lodged a complaint with Vadamadurai police station last year. But no action had been taken against her husband or her in-laws to date, they said. The women demanded criminal action against Gurunathan and his family members.",
