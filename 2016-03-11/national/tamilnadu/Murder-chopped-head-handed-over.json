    "text": "Tension at Idaiyarthavanai near Surandai in the district was doused after the police handed over the chopped head of one of the two persons murdered at Pazhayakayal in Thoothukudi district on Tuesday.\n\nAs the assailants had chopped off the head of Arumugasamy, one of the two persons killed in the gruesome murder at Pazhayakayal near Thoothukudi on Tuesday, and put it under the board carrying the picture of slain Dalit leader Pasupathi Pandian at Deivaseyalpuram in a bid to show that they had taken revenge for his murder, the police recovered the severed part and packed it to be sent it to Chennai for superimposing.\n\nHence, the police could hand over only the trunk to the relatives following the post-mortem performed at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital on Wednesday. Though they received the corpse at TMC, problem started when other family members refused to receive it as it reached Idaiyarthavanai, his birthplace near Surandai in Tirunelveli district in the evening. The agitated crowd said they would accept the body only when head is also returned along with the body and staged a protest. Since the head had to be sent to Chennai for superimposing and other analysis, it would take a minimum of two weeks to complete these procedure and hence it would not be possible for handing over the head to the relatives immediately, the police said. The protest continued even after 7 p.m.\n\nHaving left with no other option, the chopped head was handed over to the family along with the body around 10 p.m. after which the last rites were performed.",
