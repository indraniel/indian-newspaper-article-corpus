    "text": "A stench emanating from drinking water being supplied through pipelines to some of the localities in the city over the last few days has given rise to fears of contamination.\n\nThe odour is strong enough to cause hesitation to use the water for cooking purposes, residents in Sampath Nagar complained. The muddy colour of the water has further compounded the fear.\n\nHowever, corporation authorities said there was no cause for fear as chlorination of water has been undertaken in all overhead tanks. \u201cWe received such complaints from the residents a week back and narrowed down on the opening of shutters at the barrage by Tangedco for maintenance works as a possible reason. But, the stench causing sediments have now been washed downstream due to release of water from the Mettur Dam, and there was no cause for apprehension, Corporation Commissioner M. Seeni Ajmal Khan said.\n\nAs regards attribution of untreated effluents being released into canals by a section of polluting industries to the stench in drinking water, raids were conducted during night as a preventive measure, he said.\n\nThe district administration has understandably instructed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to deal sternly with such industries.",
